tldr: The article presents a formal Hardware Description Language (HDL) and its use
  in the verification of the FM9001 microprocessor. The HDL is formalized using the
  Boyer-Moore logic, and the FM9001 implementation is specified using this HDL. The
  authors mechanically checked that the HDL-based implementation specification is
  an admissible circuit and that it implements its user-level specification using
  the Boyer-Moore theorem-proving system.
