tldr: The author conducted magnetic observations in the Britannia and Conway tubular
  iron bridges to examine the magnetic action of the iron on a magnetic needle within
  the tubes. The study aimed to understand the peculiar state of tremor the iron was
  subjected to due to passing trains and its effect on the induced magnetism. The
  observations were conducted at various points of the bridges, and the results provided
  insights into the magnetic properties of the iron structures.
