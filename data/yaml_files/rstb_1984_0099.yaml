tldr: The authors isolated and analyzed complementary DNA clones related to the C4
  and C4-S1p isoforms of the fourth complement component in mice. They found sequence
  heterogeneity in the carboxy-terminal half of the chain and identified a potential
  glycosylation site in the protein encoded by one of the clones. The study also demonstrated
  that the presence of a Hind III restriction site can be used as a marker for the
  isotypic variation between C4 and C4-S1p genes in most mouse strains.
