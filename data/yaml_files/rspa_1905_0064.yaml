tldr: The author investigates the electrical conductivity of dilute solutions of sulphuric
  acid in different solvents and finds that the presence of impurities, such as carbon
  dioxide, affects the equivalent conductivity of the solution. The study concludes
  that the presence of impurities does not fully explain the phenomenon of the low
  equivalent conductivity in very dilute acid solutions.
