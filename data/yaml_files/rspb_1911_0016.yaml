tldr: This study investigates the cause of endemic goitre and its treatment. The researchers
  found that goitre is caused by a living organism in the water of goitrous localities,
  which can be destroyed by boiling or filtration. They also discovered that the enlargement
  of the thyroid gland is not great or progressive under experimental conditions.
  The development of goitre is dependent on secondary factors that favor the action
  of the unknown causal factor. The study shows that goitre can be cured by the administration
  of intestinal antiseptics, such as lactic ferments, and that the Bacillus Bulgaricus
  has a curative action on incipient goitre cases.
