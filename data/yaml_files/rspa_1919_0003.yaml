tldr: This study examines the electric potential gradient and atmospheric opacity
  at Kew Observatory, focusing on the relationship between fog and the potential gradient.
  The research also explores the visibility observations taken at different hours
  of the day and seasons of the year, providing valuable data for understanding fog
  formation and atmospheric conditions.
