tldr: The authors explore the problem of finding the optimal shape of a beam with
  given torsional and flexural rigidity. They use numerical methods to solve the optimization
  problem and find that the optimal shapes are convex for certain ranges of rigidity
  values. The results provide insights into the design of structures with specific
  mechanical properties.
