tldr: The article discusses the reassembly of cowpea chlorotic mottle virus (CCMV)
  under mild conditions, which are more plausible for the in vivo assembly reaction.
  The reassembly involves the co-aggregation of RNA and protein at a neutral pH and
  ionic strength of 0.2, resulting in 70% encapsidation. The reassembled virus shows
  stability similar to native CCMV, with the same molecular mass, buoyant density,
  and surface morphology. The study also investigates the structural transitions of
  CCMV particles and the states of aggregation of the isolated protein, providing
  insights into the mechanism of assembly.
