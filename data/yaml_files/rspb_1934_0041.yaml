tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted to determine the limit of high
  flying when breathing oxygen. The experiments involved animals and humans in pressurized
  chambers, and the results showed that about 85 mm Hg is the pressure at which severe
  symptoms occur for various animals. The study also confirmed previous findings on
  human tolerance to oxygen at high altitudes and led to the development of special
  oxygen-breathing apparatus for pilots, doubling the possible height of flying.
