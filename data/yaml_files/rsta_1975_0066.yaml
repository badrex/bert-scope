tldr: This article discusses the interstellar ionization balance caused by ultraviolet
  radiation. The authors analyze observations of stars Na 1, Ca 11, Mg 1, and 5 Ori
  using four models of the interstellar medium. They calculate the ionization equilibrium
  and chemical abundances of sodium, calcium, and magnesium, considering the effects
  of the diffuse ultraviolet radiation field and background stars. The results show
  the importance of understanding the ionization balance and chemical abundances in
  the interstellar medium for astronomical research.
