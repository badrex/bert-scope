tldr: This study investigates the effects of hygrothermal conditioning on the fatigue
  behavior of epoxy-based composites reinforced with carbon, glass, and aromatic polyamide
  fibers. The research focuses on how environmental factors such as moisture and temperature
  affect the mechanical properties and fatigue behavior of these materials, which
  are important for aerospace design.
