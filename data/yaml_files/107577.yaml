tldr: The author, John Pond, discusses the observations and analysis of fixed stars'
  parallax conducted at the Royal Observatory. He examines the work of Dr. Brinkley
  and his findings on the existence of annual parallax in fixed stars. Pond's observations,
  though confirming some discordances in favor of parallax, do not support the magnitude
  of parallax claimed by Dr. Brinkley. The author concludes that while the question
  of parallax is of theoretical curiosity, it holds practical importance for the future
  of astronomy and the determination of the distance of fixed stars.
