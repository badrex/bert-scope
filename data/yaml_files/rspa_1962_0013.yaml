tldr: This article discusses the importance of understanding the physical processes
  and mixing in estuaries and coastal waters. It focuses on the estuarine circulation,
  the influence of tidal currents, and the distribution of salinity and other properties

  highlighting the role of density currents, residual flow, and vertical mixing in
  these environments.
