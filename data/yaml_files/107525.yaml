tldr: This article explores the effects of Colchicum Autumnale, also known as meadow
  saffron, on gout and how it works through the medium of the circulating blood. The
  author, Everard Home, conducted experiments on himself and animals to demonstrate
  the rapid and effective relief of gout symptoms provided by the infusion of Colchicum
  Autumnale. This discovery suggests that medicines can act through the bloodstream,
  leading to a better understanding of disease treatment.
