tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of aerial oxidation of indoxyl and its halogen
  derivatives to determine if the reaction is suitable for cytochemical purposes.
  They found that the oxidation rates are too low for accurate enzyme localization
  in sites smaller than 10Âµm. The reaction is first-order with respect to indoxyl
  under alkaline conditions. A free radical mechanism involving intermediate formation
  of leucoindigo is postulated for the aerial oxidation. The authors also discovered
  that during oxidation, small amounts of isatins and anthranilic acids are formed
  as by-products, and approximately one molecule of hydrogen peroxide is formed for
  every molecule of indoxyl oxidized.
