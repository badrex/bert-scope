tldr: This article investigates the effects of moderate pressures on the spark spectrum
  of nickel. The authors found that increasing pressure causes significant changes
  in the character and intensity of the spectral lines. The study also reveals that
  some lines are eliminated, while others are enhanced or reversed under pressure,
  suggesting an approach to the arc condition in the spark under pressure.
