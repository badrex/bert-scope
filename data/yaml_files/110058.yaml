tldr: The author compares recent catalogues of principal fixed stars, specifically
  the Dublin and Greenwich catalogues, and discusses the differences in their observations.
  He also examines the hypothesis of a general southern motion and evaluates the accuracy
  of various catalogues and observations. Dr. Brinkley concludes that the differences
  in the catalogues can be attributed to inaccuracies in the Greenwich Catalogue and
  suggests that a particular equation may be needed for solar refraction.
