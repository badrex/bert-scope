tldr: The author presents a theoretical analysis of the growth kinetics of fungi in
  the pellet form in submerged culture. They propose that pellets consist of an outer
  layer of growing hyphae and an inner mass of non-growing mycelium. The theory explains
  the cube root growth observed in fungi and predicts that the growth-limiting nutrient
  will almost always be oxygen when air is supplied at one atmosphere. The author
  suggests several ways to test the theory, including maintaining a constant dissolved
  oxygen concentration and investigating the effect of pellet concentration.
