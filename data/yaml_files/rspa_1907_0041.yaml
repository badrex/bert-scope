tldr: The authors conducted experiments with vacuum gold-leaf electroscope to study
  mechanical temperature effects in rarefied gases. They observed striking effects
  of heat and cold on the gold leaves, which were repelled or attracted by hot and
  cold bodies. The authors also found that thermal radiations could cause significant
  disturbance of the gold leaves, and constructed a specialized electroscope to further
  investigate these phenomena.
