tldr: The authors analyze the impact of oceanic tides on the Earth's level and gravity.
  They calculate the effects of tilting caused by tidal pressure in the North Atlantic
  and compare it to the direct lunar attraction. The study provides insight into the
  relationship between load distribution on Earth's surface and its impact on the
  vertical direction and surface level.
