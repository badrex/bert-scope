tldr: This article presents a study on interannual oscillations in an ocean general
  circulation model coupled with a simple atmosphere model. The authors develop an
  intermediate coupled model to understand the oscillation mechanism in coupled general
  circulation models without atmospheric noise. They find that the coupled system
  undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, resulting in three to four-year oscillations, and
  a secondary bifurcation for six-month oscillations during the warm phase of the
  El Niño period. The study suggests that atmospheric noise is not essential for the
  oscillations.
