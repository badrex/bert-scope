tldr: This study investigates the fine structure of the red alga Griffithsia flosculosa
  using X-ray analysis and electron microscopy. The main structural component of the
  wall is found to be cellulose II (mercerized cellulose) organized into microfibrils.
  The X-ray diagram closely resembles that of the green alga Ulothrix flacca. The
  wall is lamellated, and periodic inclusions appear to be cytoplasmic. The site of
  wall formation is suggested to be deeper in the cytoplasm. This research contributes
  to understanding cell-wall organization in red algae, which is important for the
  study of other plant groups.
