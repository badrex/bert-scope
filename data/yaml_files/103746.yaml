tldr: Mr. Wasse observed that people's height changes throughout the day, especially
  between morning and night. He measured himself and others, finding that sitting
  or physical activity can cause a loss of height. This phenomenon is due to the cartilage
  between the vertebrae compressing under the weight of the body in an upright position.
  The observation was confirmed by other members of the Royal Society.
