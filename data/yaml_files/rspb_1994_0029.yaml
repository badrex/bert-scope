tldr: The study investigates membrane potentials and channel properties of microglial
  cells isolated from the leech central nervous system. The cells exhibit high membrane
  resistance and cation channel activity influenced by serotonin. These findings provide
  insights into the role of microglial cells in the leech central nervous system's
  response to injury and regeneration.
