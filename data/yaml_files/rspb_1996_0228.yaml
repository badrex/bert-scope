tldr: The authors studied the genetic basis of fluctuating asymmetry in the eyespot
  patterns of the butterfly Bicyclus anynana. They found no indication of heritable
  variation for asymmetry and no correlation in asymmetry across eyespots within individuals.
  However, a mutant allele specified a novel eyespot that tended to be more asymmetric.
  The results suggest caution in using fluctuating asymmetry as a measure of developmental
  stability.
