tldr: The authors describe a method of vacuum distillation for organic substances,
  focusing on petroleum and its derivatives. They demonstrate that high molecular
  weight compounds can be fractionated without decomposition, and discuss the use
  of vacuum distillation in producing low-vapor-pressure oils and greases for high-vacuum
  systems. The authors also analyze the performance of a condensation pump in achieving
  the necessary vacuum for these distillations.
