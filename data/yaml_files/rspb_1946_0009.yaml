tldr: This study compares the transmission of beet mosaic and beet yellows viruses
  by aphids, focusing on their behavior as non-persistent and persistent viruses.
  The research shows that beet mosaic virus is non-persistent, while beet yellows
  virus is persistent. The main difference between the two types lies in the effect
  of preliminary fasting on their infectivity. Both viruses share the same vector,
  Myzus persicae, but have different host plants and properties, indicating that the
  differences in their behavior are due to the viruses themselves.
