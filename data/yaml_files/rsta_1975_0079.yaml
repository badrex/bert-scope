tldr: The author studies the mass loss from the A-type supergiant star Cygni using
  ultraviolet spectroscopy. They find that the star is losing mass at a rate of around
  10^-5 solar masses per year, with an outward acceleration due to radiation pressure
  from the Mg II resonance lines. This mass loss is likely due to the radiation pressure
  from other resonance lines in the near-ultraviolet spectrum of A-type stars.
