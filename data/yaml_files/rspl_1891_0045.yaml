tldr: The authors describe a differential electrostatic method for measuring high
  electrical resistances using an electrometer and a source of high electromotive
  force. The method allows for accurate measurements of insulation resistance and
  can be used for various types of materials and circuits. This technique is useful
  for determining the insulating quality of small samples of materials, the insulation
  resistance of short pieces of cable, and other very high resistances.
