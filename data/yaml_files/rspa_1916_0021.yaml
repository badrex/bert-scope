tldr: The authors investigated the microscopic structure and particle size of semipermeable
  membranes, specifically precipitation membranes. They discovered that these membranes
  are made of small particles of slightly different sizes, aggregated together and
  approaching a spherical shape. The average size of these particles is between 0.1
  and 1.0 micrometers. The authors also found that these membranes may consist of
  flocculated ultramicroscopic particles, which are smaller than the visible particles.
