tldr: The article investigates the neural basis of recognition memory in chick imprinting,
  focusing on the role of the intermediate and medial part of the hyperstriatum ventrale
  in the memory process. The study also explores the cellular and sub-cellular changes
  that occur in this part of the brain after imprinting and the existence of multiple
  memory systems in the chick brain.
