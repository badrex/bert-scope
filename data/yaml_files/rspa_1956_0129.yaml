tldr: This article discusses the temperature distribution and heating mechanisms in
  the thermosphere, focusing on the influence of conductivity and the role of various
  gases in the atmosphere. The author argues that the temperature gradient likely
  decreases rapidly above the base of the thermosphere layer, rather than remaining
  constant. The article also examines the discrepancies between different measurements
  and theories regarding the thermosphere's temperature and heating processes.
