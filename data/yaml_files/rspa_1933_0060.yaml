tldr: This article investigates the scattering of electrons in thin films, focusing
  on the effects of voltage and film thickness. The results indicate that the scattering
  behavior is influenced by the presence of high-speed secondary electrons, which
  can affect the accuracy of elastic scattering measurements. The findings also suggest
  that the discrepancy between experimental data and theoretical predictions may be
  due to the influence of secondary electrons. The authors compare their results with
  the Wentzel wave mechanics formula for elastic scattering by an atom, concluding
  that the observed behavior does not require significant modification of the existing
  scattering laws.
