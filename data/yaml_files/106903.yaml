tldr: The author, John Jerome Schroeter, observed the solar eclipse of September 5,
  1793, and made detailed notes on the lunar mountains visible during the event. He
  used his 7-foot reflector telescope to study the moon's surface features and compare
  them to existing maps. He also noticed the absence of sunspots during the eclipse
  and observed a small, dark spot on the sun's surface.
