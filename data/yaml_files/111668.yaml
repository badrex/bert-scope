tldr: The author, James Pettigrew, conducted a series of dissections on mammal hearts
  to study the arrangement of muscular fibers in the ventricles. He discovered a double
  conical spiral pattern in the fibers, which he called the "double conical spiral
  arrangement." This pattern involves external and internal fibers that form continuous
  loops pointing towards both the apex and the base of the heart. This arrangement
  contributes to the rolling movements and powerful action of the ventricles.
