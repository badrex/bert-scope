tldr: The author investigates the duration of the Balmer spectrum in excited hydrogen
  and finds that it lasts much longer than current theories and experimental determinations
  suggest. The discrepancy between the observed duration and theoretical predictions
  is significant, indicating a fundamental issue with the current understanding of
  the hydrogen atom's behavior. The experiments provide evidence that the fall in
  intensity takes 10^-5 seconds, rather than the 10^-8 seconds predicted by other
  investigations.
