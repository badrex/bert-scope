tldr: The authors developed a quantum electrodynamical theory of differential scattering
  based on a two-chromophore model. They applied this theory to the process of differential
  Rayleigh scattering of circularly polarized light, calculating differential scattered
  intensities and analyzing their near- and far-zone behavior. The study has implications
  for understanding the optical properties of chiral molecules and systems with dissymmetric
  chromophore arrangements.
