tldr: The authors propose a model of dislocation-controlled rheology for the mantle,
  which accounts for long-term steady-state creep and stress wave attenuation at seismic
  frequencies. They review dislocation damping models and consider an organized microstructure
  with dislocations inside subgrain walls, explaining the magnitude and frequency
  range of seismic attenuation. The model provides a physical framework for understanding
  the relationship between the quality factor and viscosity through the dislocation
  microstructure of the mantle.
