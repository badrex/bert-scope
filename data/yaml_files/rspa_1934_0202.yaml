tldr: The authors discovered new bands and band systems in the spectrum of the hydrogen
  molecule, specifically focusing on the 3, 4d, and 3s32-*2/?TI systems. They found
  new levels and systems, which they believe could be the counterpart of the "abnormal"
  singlet states that arise from the simultaneous excitation of both electrons in
  the hydrogen molecule.
