tldr: The authors develop a gauge-invariant tensor calculus, which allows for the
  analysis of quantities with different weights in various gauge systems. This calculus
  is useful for understanding the behavior of tensors in affine and metric spaces,
  with applications in fields like general relativity and gauge theory.
