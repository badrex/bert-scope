tldr: The authors study the evolution of travelling waves in reaction-diffusion equations
  with abruptly decreasing diffusivity. They focus on the effects of an abrupt diffusivity
  cut-off on the chemical concentration and the formation of travelling wave structures.
  The research provides insights into the polymerization processes and the behavior
  of chemical species in different zones.
