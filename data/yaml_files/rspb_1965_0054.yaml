tldr: The authors discovered that phytoplankton release a significant amount of extracellular
  products during photosynthesis, which was found to be between 7-50% of the total
  carbon fixed in the photic zone of the water column. This finding suggests that
  the widely used method for determining phytoplankton productivity may underestimate
  the true rate of fixation. The implications of this discovery for understanding
  trophic relationships in aquatic habitats are considered to be considerable.
