tldr: The author, Martin Barry, examines blood coagulation and discovers two different
  types of blood discs. He observes the formation of structures similar to those in
  the body's tissues and discusses the role of parent-cells in the reproduction of
  blood corpuscles. Barry also explores the resemblance of blood corpuscle filaments
  to those of certain intestinal worms and questions whether blood corpuscles should
  be considered as ova.
