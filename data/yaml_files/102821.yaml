tldr: A 17-year-old illiterate youth can perform complex mathematical calculations
  in his head, such as fractions and multiplication. He learned this skill through
  working with money from selling sea snails and muscles. His ability to perform calculations
  is so impressive that the author considers teaching him to read, write, and do basic
  math. This case study highlights the potential for learning and cognitive abilities
  beyond traditional education.
