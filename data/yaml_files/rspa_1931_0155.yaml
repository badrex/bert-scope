tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the long-range alpha-particles
  emitted from thorium C and actinium C. They used an automatic counting method to
  study the alpha-particles' distribution and found that the groups of alpha-particles
  were complex. The ratio of the numbers of alpha-particles in the two groups was
  about 1 to 3, with the longer range being more numerous. The authors concluded that
  the emission of y-rays from radium C is connected to the appearance of these groups
  of long-range alpha-particles, suggesting that the energies of the individual alpha-particles
  in the groups represent the energies of possible alpha-particle levels in the excited
  nucleus.
