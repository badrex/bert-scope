tldr: The authors investigate the incorporation of molybdenum and tungsten species
  into anodic films formed on aluminium in molybdate and tungstate electrolytes. They
  find that both elements are incorporated into the films at similar rates but have
  different distributions due to their different mobilities. The compositions of the
  films depend on the current density, electrolyte concentration, and temperature.
  The study helps to understand the mechanism of film formation and related phenomena,
  such as dielectric breakdown.
