tldr: The article describes the Zirchnitzer-Sea, a unique subterranean lake in Carniola,
  which fills and empties through underground passages. The lake's ecosystem supports
  a variety of wildlife and fish, and its surrounding areas provide hunting and fishing
  opportunities for locals. The lake's bottom is uneven, with some areas being shallow
  and others deep, making it an interesting geological feature.
