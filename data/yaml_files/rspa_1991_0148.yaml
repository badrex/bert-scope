tldr: The authors present a new direct method for finding dromion solutions of the
  Davey-Stewartson equations, a type of two-dimensional soliton. They analyze the
  dromion solutions and provide a detailed asymptotic analysis, allowing for compact
  expressions for phase shifts and changes in amplitude due to interactions. This
  method is broader than previous direct approaches and has advantages and disadvantages
  compared to other techniques.
