tldr: The study investigates the phosphatase activity of Bacterium lactis aerogenes
  and how it varies under different growth conditions and media. The phosphatase activity
  declines rapidly during the logarithmic phase of growth and is affected by factors
  such as amino acid additions, molecular oxygen, and medium composition. The research
  suggests that phosphatase activity is highest in young cells and may be related
  to the presence of diffusible amino-acid intermediates in the medium.
