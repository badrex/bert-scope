tldr: The authors studied the diamagnetic susceptibilities of salts forming ions with
  inert gas configurations, focusing on the alkaline earth halides. They found that
  the change in ionic susceptibility is related to the change in the number of contacts
  an atom makes with surrounding atoms, or the co-ordination number. The results showed
  a decrease in susceptibility with an increase in co-ordination number. The crystal
  structures of the studied salts were also discussed, revealing that most magnesium
  and calcium halides have structures with co-ordination numbers 6 and 3, while strontium
  and barium halides have structures with co-ordination numbers 8 and 4.
