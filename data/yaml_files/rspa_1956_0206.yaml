tldr: The authors studied the catalytic fission of the carbon-nitrogen bond in methylamine
  by examining its reactions with hydrogen on evaporated metal films. They found that
  ammonia and methane were the main products, along with higher amines and carbon
  loss. The study also showed that the activation energies for methylamine decomposition
  and product formation were similar on different metals, indicating a common rate-determining
  step in the fission of the carbon-nitrogen bond. The results provide insights into
  the efficiency of various metals in breaking this bond.
