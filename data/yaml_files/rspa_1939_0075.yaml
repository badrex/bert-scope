tldr: This study investigates the combustion and ignition of aromatic hydrocarbons
  at high temperatures. The authors found that the ignition involves an abrupt increase
  in hydrogen, unsaturated and saturated hydrocarbons, and the carbon monoxide ratio.
  They also discovered that the ignition temperature and pressure relationships vary
  depending on the type of hydrocarbon and its fuel-to-oxygen ratio. The results provide
  insights into the ignition characteristics of aromatic hydrocarbons and their potential
  applications in combustion processes.
