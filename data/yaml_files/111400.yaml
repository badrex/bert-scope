tldr: The author, Frederic Field, conducted experiments to determine the comparative
  affinity of iodine, bromine, and chlorine for silver. He found that bromine has
  a greater affinity for silver than chlorine, and iodine has an even greater affinity
  than bromine. Field also developed a method to separate these elements using a reaction
  involving nitrate of silver and various potassium salts.
