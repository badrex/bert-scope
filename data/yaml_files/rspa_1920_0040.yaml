tldr: In this lecture, Sir Ernest Rutherford discusses the nuclear constitution of
  atoms and the importance of the atomic number in defining an atom's properties.
  He explains his gold foil experiment and the discovery of isotopes, which have the
  same atomic number but different atomic weights. Rutherford's work laid the foundation
  for understanding atomic structure and the behavior of subatomic particles.
