tldr: The author presents a study on the use of the Endor technique with europium
  isotopes. They discuss the spin Hamiltonian and the interactions involved, as well
  as the advantages of the technique in measuring nuclear and electron-nuclear interactions.
  The study also highlights the extraction of the hyperfine structure anomaly of the
  isotopes, which can be useful in separating the electron contributions to the hyperfine
  structure.
