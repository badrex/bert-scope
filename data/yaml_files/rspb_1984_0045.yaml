tldr: The study investigates the differentiation, extent, and layering of amacrine
  cell dendrites in the retina of a sparid fish. The researchers classified amacrine
  cells into five classes based on dendritic architecture, extent of dendritic field,
  and depth of stratification in the inner plexiform layer. The findings provide insights
  into the functional implications of dendritic morphology and may contribute to understanding
  neurotransmitter and neuromodulator specificity of amacrine cells.
