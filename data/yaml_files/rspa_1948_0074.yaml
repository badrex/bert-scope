tldr: The author presents a general method for separating longitudinal and transverse
  waves in electrodynamics, which can be applied to various cases where the usual
  method is not suitable. This method simplifies the equations of motion and allows
  for a more accurate treatment of charged particles and their interactions with electromagnetic
  fields.
