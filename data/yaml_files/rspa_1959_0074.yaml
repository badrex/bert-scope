tldr: The authors observed fringe patterns on stressed crystal lamellae during electron
  microscopy. They discovered that the patterns were consistent with the loss of electrons
  by Bragg reflexion from a lamellar single crystal in a special state of shear strain.
  The fringe pattern is an enlargement by a two-dimensional vernier coincidence process
  of the intersections of origin reflecting planes with the basal plane, and the magnification
  is related to the shear strain. This research provides a detailed examination of
  the origin of these patterns and their behavior under various conditions.
