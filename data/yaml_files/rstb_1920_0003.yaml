tldr: This study investigates the periodicity of measles epidemics in different districts
  of London between 1890 and 1912. The author discovers various periodic patterns,
  including 87, 97, 109, and 114 weeks, and analyzes the spatial distribution of these
  epidemics. The findings provide insights into the spread and prevalence of measles
  in different areas of London, which can be useful for public health strategies.
