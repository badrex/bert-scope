tldr: The author investigates the existence of a wave of greatest height and analyzes
  Stokes's conjecture in the context of fluid mechanics and water waves. They prove
  the existence of a wave of greatest height and discuss its properties, including
  its discontinuity at the crest. The study involves the use of nonlinear integral
  equations and Fourier series analysis.
