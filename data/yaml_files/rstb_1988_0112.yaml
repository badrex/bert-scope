tldr: This article discusses the differences in sex determination mechanisms between
  marsupials and eutherians. It presents evidence from the tammar wallaby and the
  North American opossum, showing that marsupials use different X-linked genes to
  control the development of structures like the scrotum, pouch, and mammary glands,
  while eutherians rely on hormonal control. The findings suggest a fundamental dichotomy
  in sex-determining mechanisms between the two subclasses of mammals.
