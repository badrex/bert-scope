tldr: The authors used a reflecting echelon grating to measure the vacuum wavelengths
  of thirty-one lines in the arc spectrum of krypton. This method allowed for direct
  comparison with the red cadmium standard, eliminating uncertainties related to the
  dispersion of normal air and laboratory air. The results provide new values for
  vacuum wavelengths in the krypton arc spectrum, contributing to the field of spectroscopy
  and precision measurements.
