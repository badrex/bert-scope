tldr: The author presents an algebraic approach to the transformation of elliptic
  functions, building upon Jacobi's work in the 'Fundamenta Nova'. The study involves
  the use of modular equations and differential equations, with a focus on odd numbers
  and prime values. The author also discusses the cases of cubic and quintic transformations,
  providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.
