tldr: This article discusses the research into the feasibility of burying high-level
  radioactive waste in the deep ocean floor. It focuses on the Great Meteor East study
  area in the Northeast Atlantic, examining the geological, geochemical, and geotechnical
  properties of the sediments. The authors outline the multiple barriers concept,
  which aims to restrict the transport of radionuclides back to humans, and explore
  the potential effectiveness of oceanic sediments in providing a barrier against
  the escape of long-lived radionuclides. The article also highlights the need for
  further research to understand the oceanic environment and assess the suitability
  of oceanic burial as a disposal option.
