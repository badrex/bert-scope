tldr: English astronomers examined the dispute between two learned men regarding the
  observation of the first of two late comets. They compared the printed writings
  of the two disputers and consulted telescopic observations made by other astronomers.
  The astronomers concluded that the comet did not pass near the star in the left
  ear of Aries, as suggested by Hevelius, but rather near the bright star in its left
  horn, according to Bayer's tables.
