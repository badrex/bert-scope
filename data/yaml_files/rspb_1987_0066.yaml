tldr: This study investigates the expression of the H-Y antigen in 34 chordate species,
  representing 25 new varieties and every major class of vertebrates. The research
  found a strong correlation between the expression of H-Y and the occurrence of the
  heterogametic-type gonad. The findings support the idea that the development of
  the mammalian testis is secondary to the interaction of soluble H-Y and a gonad
  H-Y receptor present in both sexes.
