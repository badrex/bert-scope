tldr: The author demonstrates the validity and usefulness of operations involving
  imaginary quantities in mathematics. They show that these operations follow strict
  logical rules and can be used to clarify ambiguous expressions and facilitate calculations.
  The author also argues that imaginary expressions are particularly helpful in deducing
  certain conclusions that would be difficult to obtain without them.
