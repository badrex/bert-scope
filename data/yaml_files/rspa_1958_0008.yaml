tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the magnetic susceptibility of oxygen in
  a clathrate compound and found that the molecule's behavior is influenced by the
  crystalline field surrounding it. They developed a new theory that considers the
  oxygen molecule as partially bound, which explains the discrepancies in previous
  measurements and provides a better understanding of the magnetic properties of the
  compound.
