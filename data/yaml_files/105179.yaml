tldr: This article discusses the observations made during a severe cold weather event
  in 1753 by William Arderon and Henry Miles. They recorded temperature changes, the
  effects of frost on various materials, and the behavior of water and other liquids
  in freezing conditions. Their observations provide insights into the understanding
  of extreme weather events and their impacts.
