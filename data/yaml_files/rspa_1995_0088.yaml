tldr: The author presents an interface integral equation method for the electrostatic
  problem in composites with anisotropic conductivity tensors. The electric potential
  is represented by a single-layer charge density on the component interfaces, and
  the integral equation is solved to accurately compute effective properties of locally
  anisotropic composites. This method demonstrates potential for composites with general
  geometries.
