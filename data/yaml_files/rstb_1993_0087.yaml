tldr: The authors re-examine the Cohesion Theory of water transport in plants, which
  states that water is pulled from roots to leaves through xylem vessels under tension.
  They discuss the limitations of traditional indirect methods for measuring xylem
  pressure and present new data from xylem pressure probe and nuclear magnetic resonance
  imaging. The authors propose that several forces, including tension, osmotic pressure,
  capillary forces, and air-water interfacial forces, may be responsible for long-distance
  water transport in plants.
