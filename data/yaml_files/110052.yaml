tldr: The author discusses the historical understanding of astronomical refractions
  and the methods used to calculate them. They explore various theories on the height
  and density of the atmosphere, considering factors such as temperature and pressure.
  The author also investigates the motion of light and its relation to atmospheric
  refraction, comparing their findings with observed astronomical data.
