tldr: The author examines the structure of the fossil fern Zygopteris primaria and
  discovers that it had a typical Etapteris stem with a leaf-trace sequence and root
  structure similar to Botrychioxylon. This finding challenges previous classifications
  and nomenclature within the Zygopterid family.
