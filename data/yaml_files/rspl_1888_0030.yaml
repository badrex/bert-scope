tldr: Researchers G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar conducted further experiments on the
  spectrum of magnesium, observing that differences in temperature have less impact
  on the spectrum than previously thought. They discovered that certain spectral lines
  appear in both spark and arc discharges, and that the set of seven bands in the
  green, attributed to the oxide of magnesium, are influenced by the nature of the
  gas used in the experiment. The authors also discuss the possibility of the energy
  of the electric discharge directly imparting vibrations to the affected matter,
  and the temperature of complete dissociation of magnesia being much higher than
  the temperature of a Bunsen burner.
