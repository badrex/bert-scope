tldr: The authors develop a self-consistent molecular orbital theory for conjugated
  molecules using molecular orbital perturbation theory. They study inductive and
  electromeric displacements in conjugated molecules, providing insights into energy
  stabilization and charge distribution changes. The theory is applied to inductive
  substituents in benzene and electromeric displacements in furan, pyrrole, aniline,
  and phenol.
