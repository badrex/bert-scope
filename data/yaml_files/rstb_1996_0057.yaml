tldr: This article discusses the role of transcription factors in the regulation of
  gene expression during the development of a Drosophila embryo. It highlights the
  importance of maternal and zygotic transcription factors in establishing the anterior-posterior
  axis and the molecular mechanisms that control gene expression in a position-dependent
  manner.
