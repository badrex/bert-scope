tldr: The article presents a modified version of Dirac's time-dependent perturbation
  theory that eliminates undesirable secular terms, allowing for an order-by-order
  calculation of the exact wavefunction for resonant harmonic perturbations and offering
  a simple route to establish the adiabatic hypothesis in quantum mechanics. The new
  formulation introduces flexibility in the choice of phase factors associated with
  varying amplitudes and develops a perturbation procedure that closely resembles
  the Brillouin-Wigner formalism in the static case.
