tldr: The author explains how the eye accommodates for near and far vision through
  the interaction of the ciliary muscle, ciliary processes, and iris. The ciliary
  muscle compresses the veins in the ciliary processes, causing them to expand and
  change the shape of the lens for near vision. The iris also aids in accommodation
  by adjusting the plane of its opening, allowing for faster changes in focus.
