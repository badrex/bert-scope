tldr: The author presents a new interferential form of elasticity apparatus called
  the elasmometer, which uses interference methods to measure the amount of flexure
  in a crystal plate. The elasmometer is a significant improvement over previous elasticity
  apparatus, offering greater accuracy and convenience. This innovative device can
  be used to study the physical properties of various materials, including crystals
  and non-crystalline substances.
