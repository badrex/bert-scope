tldr: The author, William Scoresby, conducted experiments to determine the effect
  of percussion on the development of magnetic properties in steel and iron. He discovered
  that the magnetizing effects of percussion could be significantly increased by hammering
  the steel bar while it rested on a magnetic iron or steel rod. The experiments showed
  that the magnetism in steel and iron could be developed and manipulated through
  various methods of percussion and contact with other magnetic materials.
