tldr: The authors conducted macro-chemical experiments on the endodermis, a crucial
  layer in plant roots and shoots, to understand its structure and function. They
  discovered that the endodermis has different stages of development, each with distinct
  micro-chemical properties. The endodermis acts as a barrier, preventing the exchange
  of water and water-soluble solutes between the tissues it separates. The study confirms
  the presence of fatty substances and complexes in the endodermis, which play a role
  in its function.
