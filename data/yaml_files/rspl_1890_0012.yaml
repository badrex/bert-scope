tldr: The author developed a method to determine rapid variations of a difference
  of potential using the capillary electrometer. They discovered that the time required
  for the meniscus to traverse half the distance in response to a sudden introduction
  of a permanent difference of potential is independent of the amount of that difference.
  This method allows for the analysis of electrical phenomena in living tissues and
  the estimation of the difference of potential corresponding to any part of the photographed
  curve.
