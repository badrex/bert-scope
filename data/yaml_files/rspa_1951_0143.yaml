tldr: The authors discovered that Dauphiné twinning in quartz can be created, modified,
  or eliminated by subjecting quartz specimens to stress produced by mechanical or
  thermal means. They proposed the term "piezoeresence" to describe this reversible
  phenomenon, where one crystallographic orientation grows out of another under the
  influence of stress. The study provides insights into the development of twin patterns
  in quartz and the potential applications in telecommunications and crystallography.
