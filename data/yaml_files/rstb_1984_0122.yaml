tldr: The authors cloned seven cDNAs corresponding to mRNAs induced by type I interferon
  in human cells. They studied the kinetics of mRNA induction, sensitivity to cycloheximide,
  and response in interferon-resistant cell lines. The interferon-induced mRNAs are
  involved in the antiviral and antigrowth responses of cells. The authors also found
  that continuous binding of interferon to the cell surface receptor is necessary
  for the response to continue.
