tldr: This article discusses the orbit analysis of the part of the Leonid meteor stream
  that the Earth encountered on November 15, 1898. The author, Arthur A. Rambaut,
  analyzes meteor observations from various locations and determines the position
  of the radiant point, which is crucial for predicting meteor showers. The article
  also explains the effect of the Earth's attraction on the position of the radiant
  point and provides the definitive position of the Leonid meteors of 1898.
