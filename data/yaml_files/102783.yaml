tldr: A young boy had a kidney stone removed, and inside the stone, a flint-like object
  was found. This unusual case study suggests that the flint may have been swallowed
  by the boy and became part of the stone formation. A similar instance of a man passing
  a bullet-like object in his urine is also mentioned.
