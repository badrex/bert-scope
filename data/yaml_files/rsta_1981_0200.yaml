tldr: This article discusses the discovery and analysis of planetary rings around
  Jupiter, Saturn, and Uranus. The focus is on the narrow, eccentric rings, which
  present complex dynamical problems. The author explores the gravitational action
  of small satellites on the orbits of ring particles and the various factors that
  contribute to the structure and origin of these rings.
