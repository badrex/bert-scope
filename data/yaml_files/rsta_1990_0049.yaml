tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the Earth's climate and the
  variability of the Sun over recent millennia. Geophysicists, archaeologists, and
  other experts explore the potential links between climate changes, solar activity,
  and human migration. They also examine the use of various methods, such as tree
  rings and ice cores, to study these connections and understand the Earth's past
  and future climate trends.
