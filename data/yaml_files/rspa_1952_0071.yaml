tldr: The authors measured the temperature variation of the magnetic susceptibilities
  of platinum, rhodium, and palladium from 20 to 290 Kelvin. They used a Sucksmith
  balance to record the deflections of a light beam passing through the balance, and
  a Au-Co/Au-Ag thermocouple to measure the temperature of the specimens. The results
  showed a maximum susceptibility in palladium at 77 K, a change in the susceptibility
  temperature curve for platinum below 77 K, and a regular increase in susceptibility
  with temperature for rhodium. The findings are discussed in relation to the collective
  electron treatment of metals and provide estimates of the effective Fermi-Dirac
  degeneracy temperature, the number of holes per atom, and the exchange interaction
  energy.
