tldr: The author, John William Lubbock, investigates the tides and their influence
  on coastal dynamics, using observations from London Docks and Liverpool. He examines
  the constants D and E for each location, which help determine the height of high
  water, and discusses the semimenstrual inequality and diurnal inequality of the
  tides. Lubbock also explores the establishment of ports and the fluctuations in
  the average height of high water, highlighting the challenges in tide predictions.
