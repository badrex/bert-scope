tldr: This study found that mice fed on autoclaved diet had stronger cell-mediated
  immune reactions than those fed on an unmodified diet. The research suggests that
  this intensification of immunity is partly due to a deprivation of polyunsaturated
  fatty acids and partly due to an immunopotentiation by derivatives of retinol (vitamin
  A alcohol). The findings could have implications for understanding and improving
  transplantation immunity and overall health.
