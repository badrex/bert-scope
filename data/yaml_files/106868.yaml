tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the composition of water and the
  decomposition of inflammable air. They discovered that when dephlogisticated and
  inflammable air are mixed and ignited, either nitrous acid or pure water can be
  produced, depending on the proportions of the two gases. This finding challenges
  the prevailing phlogiston theory and supports the idea that water may be composed
  of these elements in different proportions and modes of combination.
