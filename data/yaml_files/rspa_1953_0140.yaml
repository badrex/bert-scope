tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the stability of gaseous lithium
  hydroxide at high temperatures and its relation to the hydroxyl concentration in
  flame gases. They found that lithium hydroxide is as stable as predicted and confirmed
  the existence and importance of the 'hydroxide effect' in flames. This work suggests
  a simple method to measure the absolute concentration of hydroxyl radicals in flame
  gases of known temperature.
