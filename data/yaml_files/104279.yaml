tldr: Edmund Stone discovered two new species of lines of the third order, which were
  not mentioned by Sir Isaac Newton or Mr. Sterling. He explained the properties of
  these lines and their corresponding curves, and provided illustrations to support
  his findings. Stone's work expanded the understanding of the 72 species of lines
  of the third order previously known.
