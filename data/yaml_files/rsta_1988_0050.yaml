tldr: This article explores the use of conservative tracers, such as nitrates, phosphates,
  and oxygen, in studying the ocean circulation. The authors demonstrate how these
  tracers can provide additional information to traditional methods, like density,
  temperature, and salinity, and discuss the limitations of current sampling strategies
  in determining the ocean circulation accurately. They also compare two inverse methods,
  the spiral method and the Bernoulli method, to analyze the data from the GEOSECS
  cruises.
