tldr: The author investigates the impact of natural selection on the variability and
  correlation of organs in a population. They develop a mathematical theory to distinguish
  between directly and indirectly selected organs and demonstrate how selection influences
  the size, variability, and correlations of organs. The study also introduces the
  concepts of positive and negative selection, showing that the fittest individuals
  are not always the most frequent survivors.
