tldr: This article examines the vertical transport of heat in the atmosphere through
  eddy diffusion, discussing the limitations of the classical theory and the role
  of convective turbulence. The authors argue that the classical theory, which assumes
  eddies are an average sample of the air at their level of origin, is incorrect when
  considering buoyancy effects. They introduce a more rigid definition of the 'level
  of origin' of an eddy and propose the concept of 'convective turbulence,' which
  opposes the general downward transfer of mechanical turbulence. The authors also
  discuss the implications of their findings in synoptic and general theoretical meteorology.
