tldr: The author discusses instances of people who suffered from swallowing plumb-stones,
  which led to sickness or death. They compare these cases to bezoars, and argue against
  the common belief that fruit stones are wholesome. The author also mentions the
  potential risks of swallowing seeds and fruit stones, as they can cause health issues
  due to the structure of the digestive system and the presence of hair, fibers, and
  other substances in the food we consume.
