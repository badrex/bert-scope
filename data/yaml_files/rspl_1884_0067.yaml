tldr: The author discovered the marsupial ovum and male mammary glands in Echidna
  hystrix, proving that Echidnas are oviparous mammals. The findings challenge previous
  beliefs about the reproductive systems of monotremes and provide new insights into
  the development and function of mammary glands.
