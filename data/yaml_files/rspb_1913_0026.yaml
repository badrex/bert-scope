tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the formation of anthocyan pigments
  in plants. They discovered that the presence of chromogens in flowers is related
  to anthocyan pigment formation. The recovery of color in decolorized petals supports
  the conclusion that anthocyanic pigments arise from the oxidation of chromogens.
  The study also highlights the role of reducing agents in the loss of color in dehydrated
  petals.
