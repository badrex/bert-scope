tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of radial integrals for nuclear s,
  p, and d shells, focusing on the interaction potential and particle radial wave-functions.
  The author evaluates integrals for the Gaussian and meson interactions, providing
  explicit expressions and numerical values for various integrals and ratios relevant
  to nuclear energy levels and spectroscopy.
