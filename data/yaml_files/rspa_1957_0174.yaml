tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray crystallography study on four different crystal
  structures of vitamin B12 to determine its molecular structure. They identified
  a nucleotide-like group and a nucleus surrounding the cobalt atom, which helped
  in refining the electron density distributions and establishing the arrangement
  of atoms in the molecule. The findings provide insights into the chemical structure
  and stereochemistry of vitamin B12, revealing its relation to porphyrins and porphobilinogen.
