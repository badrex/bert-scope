tldr: The author investigates the role of diffusion and convection in catalytic reactions
  involving colloidal metals. They find that convection currents play a significant
  part in accelerating the reactions, and that the assumption of a heterogeneous reaction
  with a stationary liquid does not hold true. The study provides insights into the
  factors affecting reaction velocities and the importance of considering both diffusion
  and convection in understanding catalytic processes.
