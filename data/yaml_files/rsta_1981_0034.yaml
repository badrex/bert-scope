tldr: This article discusses recent advances in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) spectroscopy, focusing on the observation of high-resolution dipolar spectra
  in solids. The authors describe various techniques, including single-crystal and
  two-dimensional spectroscopy, to improve resolution and obtain dipolar spectra from
  powder samples. They also demonstrate the potential of NMR as a tool for determining
  molecular structure and discuss its applications in studying small molecules, amino
  acids, and peptides.
