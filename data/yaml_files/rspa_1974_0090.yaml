tldr: The authors measured the five single crystal elastic constants of gadolinium,
  terbium, and erbium within the temperature range of 4.2-300 K. They reduced the
  contributions to the elastic constants due to domain and spin rotation effects by
  applying a magnetic field of 2.5 T along the magnetic easy directions. The study
  provides a complete set of elastic constants for all the heavy rare-earth elements
  except thulium.
