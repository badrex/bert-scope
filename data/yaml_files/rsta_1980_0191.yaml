tldr: This article presents a fully relativistic analysis of 5p excitation in atomic
  barium. The authors use computer calculations to study the behavior of electrons
  in barium atoms and explain the intensity of signals produced during electron-impact
  ionization. Their findings contribute to the understanding of atomic physics and
  the development of spectroscopy techniques.
