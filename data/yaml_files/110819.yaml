tldr: The author conducted experiments on plant leaves and found that they restore
  the surrounding air by absorbing carbonic acid and releasing oxygenous gas. This
  process is influenced by light and continues even in the dark. Carbonic acid is
  not released during the healthy condition of the leaf, and the first portions of
  carbonic acid gas are taken up more eagerly by plants than the remaining portions.
