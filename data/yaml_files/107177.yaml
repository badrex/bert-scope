tldr: The author, Timothy Lane, conducted experiments to understand the magnetic properties
  of iron oxides. He found that heat alone did not make the oxides magnetic, but when
  combined with inflammable matter, they became magnetic. This explained why some
  iron ores became magnetic when heated and then lost their magnetism when the heat
  was continued long enough to drive off the inflammable matter.
