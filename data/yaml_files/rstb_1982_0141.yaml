tldr: The study investigates the binding and transport of anions in living tissues,
  specifically chloride channels in toad skin. The researchers found that the passive
  pathway in toad skin exhibits current rectification, with a larger conductance for
  outward currents. They also discovered that the time response of the current to
  applied potential steps revealed a time-dependent conductance increase, similar
  to voltage-gated cation channels in excitable membranes. The study provides insight
  into the mechanisms of chloride transport through the chloride-conductive pathway
  in toad skin.
