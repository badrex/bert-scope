tldr: The authors studied the effect of temperature on the intensity of X-ray reflexion
  in gold, copper, and aluminum. They found that the observed fall in intensity can
  be explained by the characteristic temperature varying with temperature, in accordance
  with a specific relation. The results agree with values obtained by specific heat
  and electrical conductivity methods.
