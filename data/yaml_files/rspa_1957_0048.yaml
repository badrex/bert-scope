tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the cross-sections for the dissociation
  of 200 keV H2 ions in various gases. They also observed the angular distribution
  of the H+ particles resulting from the dissociation of molecular ions. This research
  provides insights into the dissociation process and the behavior of ions in gases.
