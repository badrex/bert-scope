tldr: This study investigates the growth of three-dimensional modes in boundary layers
  with tuned and detuned subharmonic resonance. The research uses controlled periodic
  disturbances to excite specific waves and observe their resonant growth. The findings
  show that detuned subharmonic resonance leads to enhanced growth of modes and the
  generation of numerous discrete modes through successive sum and difference interactions.
  This process accounts for the rapid spectral filling and low-frequency modulation
  commonly observed in natural subharmonic transition.
