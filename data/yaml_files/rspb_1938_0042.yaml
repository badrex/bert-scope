tldr: The author examines the blood circulation and metabolism of sabellid worms,
  which have a unique respiratory pigment called chlorocruorin. The study describes
  the various aspects of the blood circulation system, including the different blood
  vessels and their contractions. The author also discusses the oxygen supply to the
  muscles and the possible role of coelomic capillaries in supplying oxygen to genital
  products during the breeding season. The research was conducted at the Station maritime
  de Biologie, Tamaris-sur-Mer, and at the University of Birmingham.
