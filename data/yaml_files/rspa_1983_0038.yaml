tldr: This study investigates the absorption of hydrogen in palladium-platinum alloys,
  focusing on the palladium-platinum-hydrogen system. Researchers measured changes
  in electrical resistivity and derived equilibrium hydrogen pressures from electrode
  potential measurements. The results show that with increasing platinum content,
  hydrogen absorption occurs over a wider range of pressures, and overall forms of
  relations between electrical resistivity and equilibrium hydrogen pressure remain
  similar. The study contributes to understanding the behavior of these systems and
  their potential applications.
