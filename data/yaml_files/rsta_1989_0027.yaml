tldr: This article discusses the interactions between the magnetosphere, high-latitude
  ionosphere, and the solar wind. Radar studies of ionospheric flows reveal a two-cell
  pattern with westward and eastward flows in the pre- and post-midnight sectors.
  The flow pattern is sensitive to the solar wind and the direction of the interplanetary
  magnetic field, providing valuable information about the coupling of the solar wind,
  magnetosphere, and ionosphere. The Sweden and Britain Radar-auroral Experiment (SABRE)
  is used to measure these flows and their interactions.
