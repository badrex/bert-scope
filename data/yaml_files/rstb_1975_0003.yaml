tldr: The study investigates the walking behavior of the American lobster (Homarus
  americanus) using a closed-circuit television system and a video-tape recorder.
  The research focuses on the stepping sequences, leg movements, and muscle activity
  during walking. The findings reveal that the lobster's walking pattern is altered
  when the support function of any leg is impaired, and the changes are in a direction
  that compensates for the loss of support. The study also discusses the role of sensory
  input in lobster walking and the importance of understanding the mechanisms underlying
  complex behaviors.
