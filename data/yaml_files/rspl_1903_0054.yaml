tldr: This article discusses the discovery of phaseolunatin, a cyanogenetic glucoside
  found in the plant Phaseolus lunatus. The authors explore the process of cyanogenesis
  and the production of hydrocyanic acid in the plant, which can be toxic in certain
  forms. They also describe the extraction and purification of phaseolunatin, as well
  as its properties and chemical composition.
