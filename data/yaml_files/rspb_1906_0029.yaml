tldr: 'The authors discovered that adding boiled and filtered yeast-juice to glucose
  fermentation by yeast-juice significantly increases the alcoholic fermentation.
  They found that the active component in the boiled and filtered yeast-juice is not
  destroyed by heat and can be separated by dialysis. This discovery led to the understanding
  that yeast-juice contains two fractions: an inactive residue and a dialysate that
  can activate the residue.'
