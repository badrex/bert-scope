tldr: The authors explore the relationship between chlorophyll fluorescence and photosynthetic
  carbon assimilation in various plant species. They find a curvilinear relationship
  between the fluorescence parameter (Fm - FJFm) and the quantum efficiency of photosynthetic
  carbon assimilation. This discovery can help measure photosynthesis and the effect
  of light on dark respiration using non-intrusive fluorescence techniques without
  analyzing gaseous exchange between the leaf and atmosphere.
