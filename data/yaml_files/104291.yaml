tldr: The author, Abbe Pluche, observed the smut of corn using a microscope and discovered
  that the cause of the disease is due to the sun's rays focusing on the stalks, causing
  them to dry up and preventing the ear from grain. Additionally, he observed thrushes
  and starlings gathering around grazing cattle, suggesting that they seek worms in
  the soil attracted by the cattle's weight.
