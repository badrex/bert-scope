tldr: This study investigates the question of whether the renal tubule actively secretes
  phenolsulphonephthalein, a dye used to test renal function. The authors conducted
  experiments on rabbits and frogs, observing the accumulation of the dye in the tubules
  and analyzing urine samples. Their findings suggest that phenolsulphonephthalein
  can pass into the tubules either by diffusion or secretion, providing evidence for
  the role of the renal tubule in its elimination.
