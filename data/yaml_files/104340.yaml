tldr: The author, John Huxham, shares a case study of an unusual inguinal hernia and
  the patient's death. He also observes the passage of Mercury over the Sun on October
  31, 1738. The case study highlights the importance of careful examination and treatment
  of hernias, while the solar observation provides information on the appearance of
  the Sun during that time.
