tldr: The author conducted experiments on the behavior of gun-cotton and gunpowder
  when exposed to high temperatures and rarefied atmospheres. They discovered that
  the combustion of gun-cotton can be altered depending on the atmospheric pressure
  and conditions, with slower and different forms of combustion occurring in highly
  rarefied atmospheres. This research has implications for understanding the rate
  of combustion of fuses and explosives under different atmospheric pressures.
