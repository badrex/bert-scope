tldr: 'The authors conducted a thorough revision of the class Cyclocystoidea, a group
  of Paleozoic echinoderms. They discovered that the cyclocystoid test consisted of
  three parts: a complex central disc, a marginal ring of stout perforate ossicles,
  and an encircling peripheral skirt. The class is now restricted to include only
  those forms with perforate marginal ossicles, consisting of eight genera, six of
  which are new. Cyclocystoids were microphagous organic feeders, gathering food at
  the marginal cupules and passing it to the central mouth along radial channels.
  They likely lived with the oral surface below and possibly moved by means of tube
  feet.'
