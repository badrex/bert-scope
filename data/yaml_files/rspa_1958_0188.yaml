tldr: The author used an electron microscope to study the decomposition of magnesium
  hydroxide crystals. They observed the crystallographic and morphological changes
  that occur during the endothermic decomposition process, which involves the dehydration
  of magnesium hydroxide to magnesium oxide. The study provides insights into the
  structural changes and the formation of highly ordered aggregates of micro-crystallites
  of magnesium oxide.
