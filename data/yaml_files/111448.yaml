tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, investigates the successive differential coefficients
  of certain mathematical expressions and discovers new formulae for differentiation.
  These formulae have applications in evaluating definite integrals and are used to
  demonstrate two remarkable identities related to Laplace's functions.
