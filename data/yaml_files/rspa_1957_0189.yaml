tldr: The authors measured the heat capacity of potassium chloride, potassium bromide,
  potassium iodide, and sodium iodide between 2.8 and 270 K using adiabatic calorimeter
  assemblies. The results show that the heat capacity of these alkali halide crystals
  generally agrees with the predictions of harmonic lattice theory, except at the
  highest temperatures. This study provides a foundation for further analysis and
  interpretation of the thermal properties of these crystals.
