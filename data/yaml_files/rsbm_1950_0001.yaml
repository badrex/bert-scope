tldr: Joseph Edwin Barnard was a distinguished amateur microscopist who made significant
  contributions to the field of microscopy. He developed the ultra-violet microscope,
  which allowed for the study of filterable viruses and the observation of minute
  microorganisms. Barnard's work involved the design and adjustment of various microscope
  components, and his innovations led to improved accuracy and sharper images. His
  research on viruses, such as vesicular stomatitis and foot-and-mouth disease, provided
  valuable insights into the structure and infectivity of these diseases.
