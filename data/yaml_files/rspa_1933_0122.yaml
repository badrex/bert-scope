tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption spectrum of nitrogen tetroxide
  and found evidence supporting the molecular structure of N2O4. They identified twelve
  fundamental frequencies and explained how the molecule's vibrations can be built
  up from the mutual vibrations of two NO2 groups. The study also discussed the selection
  rules for infra-red frequencies and Raman scattering, and the characteristics of
  asymmetrical top molecules.
