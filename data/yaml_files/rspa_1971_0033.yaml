semantic_tags:

tldr: The article discusses the extension of ray tracing techniques to use complex
  space for studying radio wave propagation in complex media, such as the ionosphere.
  The authors explore the effects of ray convergence and divergence on the energy
  flux in a ray pencil and provide specific applications, including the determination
  of the angular diameter of the Ellis window.
