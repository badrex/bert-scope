tldr: The authors propose a spin-dependent intermolecular potential based on molecular
  orbital overlap to predict the crystal structure and antiferromagnetism of solid
  oxygen. They compare their results with a Lennard-Jones potential calculation and
  find that the spin-dependent potential better explains the distortion of the (001)
  plane from hexagonal symmetry due to magnetic ordering. The magnetic exchange constant
  is found to be 4, in comparison to the value derived from the magnon spectrum.
