tldr: The authors investigated the surface micromorphology and ultrastructure of silicas
  extracted from different regions of the horsetail plant, Equisetum arvense. They
  found complex and varied ultrastructural motifs of silica, which varied with the
  anatomical region studied. The study discusses the importance of structure-function
  relationships, cell wall composition, and transpiration in the development of specific
  silicified structures in the plant.
