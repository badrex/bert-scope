tldr: 'The author, Edward Schunck, discusses the separation of chlorophyll into two
  components: one green and fluorescent, the other yellow and non-fluorescent. He
  also examines the decomposition products of these components with acids, finding
  that only the green component yields glucose. This research contributes to understanding
  the complex nature of chlorophyll and its role in photosynthesis.'
