tldr: The authors investigate the temperature dependence of the magnetic moment in
  iron (111) complexes, considering the effects of configurational mixing and spin-orbit
  coupling. They derive an expression for the magnetic moment and compare their calculated
  results with experimental data for iron (111)-dialkyldithiocarbamates. The study
  shows that configurational mixing has a more significant impact on calculated magnetic
  moments, with changes of up to 10% for certain temperature ranges.
