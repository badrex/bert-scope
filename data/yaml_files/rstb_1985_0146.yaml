tldr: 'The authors explore the role of marine cementation in the preservation of Lower
  Palaeozoic fossil assemblages. They argue that early marine cementation acted to
  retard taphonomic processes, leading to better preservation of fossil communities
  in carbonate shelf environments during the early Palaeozoic era. The cementation
  process had three main effects on fossil accumulation: forming hardground communities,
  producing mixed assemblages through incremental cementation, and preserving fossils
  in life position by immobilizing skeletons with cement fringes.'
