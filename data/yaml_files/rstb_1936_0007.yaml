tldr: This study investigates the phylogeny and evolution of British Silurian Rugose
  Corals with Acanthine Septa. The research focuses on the coral skeleton's microscopic
  structure and the conditions of life under which these corals lived. The author
  emphasizes the importance of studying all possible characters at different stratigraphical
  horizons to understand the complex and interwoven processes of evolution. The study
  also highlights the significance of septal structure as an evolving character in
  the Silurian and Devonian families of corals.
