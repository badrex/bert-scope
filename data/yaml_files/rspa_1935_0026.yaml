tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the Raman effect and temperature
  on ammonium chloride, bromide, and iodide. They used a specially designed spectrograph
  to analyze the scattered light from compressed samples in a metal bar cooled by
  various refrigerants. The study aimed to understand the changes in the spectrum
  and the effects of temperature on these compounds.
