tldr: This study investigates the oscillatory ignitions and cool flames accompanying
  the non-isothermal oxidation of acetaldehyde in a well-stirred, continuous-flow
  reactor. The researchers observed nine chemically and physically distinct stable
  modes of reaction, including seven types of stable oscillations and two stationary
  states. They mapped the conditions for each mode on an ignition diagram and found
  unprecedented variety in the behavior of the reaction.
