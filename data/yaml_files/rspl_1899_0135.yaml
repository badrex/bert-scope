tldr: This article presents two papers read to the Royal Society of London. The first
  paper discusses the development of enamel in certain osseous fish by Charles S.
  Tomes, while the second paper, by J. H. Grindley, investigates the thermo-dynamical
  properties of superheated steam. Both papers contribute to the understanding of
  their respective fields.
