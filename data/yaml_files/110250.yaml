tldr: Edmund Davy discovered a new gas, chloro-nitrous gas, by combining chlorine
  and nitrous gas. He studied its properties, reactions with various substances, and
  its formation from the mutual action of nitric and muriatic acids. Chloro-nitrous
  gas has a strong affinity for moisture, bleaches vegetable colors, and forms an
  acid resembling aqua regia when mixed with water.
