tldr: The author, Thomas Graham, investigates the constitution of various salts, including
  oxalates, nitrates, phosphates, sulphates, and chlorides. He examines the properties
  and compositions of these salts, focusing on their water content and the way they
  interact with other substances. His findings contribute to a better understanding
  of the chemistry of these compounds and their potential applications.
