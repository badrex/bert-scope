tldr: The authors observed and analyzed the absorption spectrum of diatomic phosphorus
  in the vacuum ultraviolet region, identifying nine Rydberg series and determining
  the first ionization potential of P2. The study helps establish the relative positions
  of the states of P^ and provides insights into the molecular ion's structure and
  properties.
