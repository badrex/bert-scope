tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to analyze the chemical composition
  of horse urine in both healthy and working conditions. They found that the composition
  of horse urine varies widely, even when the horse's diet and conditions remain the
  same. The author also observed differences in urine composition based on the horse's
  activity level, season, and other factors. The study provides valuable insights
  into horse nutrition and veterinary science.
