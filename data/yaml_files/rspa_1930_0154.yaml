tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the sorption of carbon tetrachloride
  by activated charcoals at low pressures. They found that the nature of the sorption
  isothermals is greatly affected by the presence of trace gases on the charcoal surface.
  The experiments showed that increasing the evacuation temperature led to a higher
  removal of these gases, which in turn affected the shape and reversibility of the
  isothermals. The authors also discovered breaks in the isosteres, which they attributed
  to the presence of gas impurities.
