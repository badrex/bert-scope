revised_title: Low Temperature Effects on Supersaturated Glauber Salt Solutions
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Crystallography
semantic_tags:
- Supersaturated solutions
- Glauber's salt
- Hydrates
- Low temperatures
- Crystal formation
tldr: The author studied the effects of low temperatures on supersaturated solutions
  of Glauber's salt. They discovered the formation of two new hydrates and observed
  the unique crystal formations and temperature changes that occurred during the cooling
  process. This research expanded the understanding of supersaturated solutions and
  their behavior under various conditions.
