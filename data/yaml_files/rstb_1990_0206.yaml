tldr: 'The study investigates the ciliary band innervation and organization in the
  bipinnaria larva of Pisaster ochraceus. It identifies three nerve cell types within
  the band: sensory cells, bipolar cells, and multipolar cells. The study also examines
  the larval behavior and the role of cholinergic and catecholamine-containing cells
  in controlling ciliary beat. The findings support the theory that the bipinnaria
  larva could provide insights into the evolution of chordates.'
