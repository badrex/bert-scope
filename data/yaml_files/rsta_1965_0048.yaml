tldr: The authors describe the application of phased arrays to analyze seismic body
  waves, improving signal-to-noise ratios and aiding in the identification of seismic
  phases. Arrays of seismometers can separate signal components by velocity and azimuth
  filtering, allowing for better epicenter location estimates. The study demonstrates
  the use of array techniques on teleseismic events, including core phase detection
  and noise reduction.
