tldr: The authors analyze the Hoyle-Narlikar theory of gravitation, derived from a
  direct-particle action principle, and show that it is incompatible with an expanding
  universe. They argue that the advanced field would be infinite, and suggest that
  allowing negative mass might be a way to overcome this difficulty. However, they
  also note that introducing negative masses would likely raise more problems than
  it would solve.
