tldr: The authors studied the benzoyl peroxide catalyzed copolymerization of vinyl
  and vinylidene chlorides. They found that the rate of copolymerization increases
  during the reaction, and the percentage increase in rate varies with the solubility
  of the copolymer formed. The authors developed a method to determine the rates at
  which individual monomers enter the copolymer, which helps to understand the reaction
  kinetics better. The results show that the rate of copolymerization is reduced to
  a minimum value when using pure monomers and increases as the monomer composition
  changes.
