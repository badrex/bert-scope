tldr: J.W. Lubbock presents a discussion of about 14,000 tide observations made at
  Liverpool, analyzing moon's transits, parallax, and declination, as well as the
  height of high water and barometer readings. The study compares these observations
  to those taken at the London and St. Katherine's Docks, finding differences in tide
  times and heights.
