tldr: The article investigates the steady state of heat production in nerve tissue
  during stimulation. It finds that at low frequencies, a steady state is reached,
  while at high frequencies, the heat production reaches a maximum and then falls
  off. This indicates that a steady state is not possible at high frequencies due
  to fatigue.
