tldr: This article presents an atlas of the infra-red solar spectrum from 1 to 6.5
  Âµm observed from high-altitude aircraft. The researchers recorded 1200 absorption
  lines belonging to water vapor, CO2, CO, NaO, and CH4. The study was conducted during
  98 flights with a high-resolution grating spectrometer installed in a Canberra aircraft
  at altitudes of 20,000 to 49,000 ft. The findings provide valuable data for understanding
  the Earth's atmosphere and solar spectrum.
