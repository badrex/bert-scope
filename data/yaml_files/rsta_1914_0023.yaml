  and Applications to Hot-Wire Anemometry'

tldr: The authors investigate the convection of heat from small cylinders in a fluid
  stream, focusing on the determination of convection constants for small platinum
  wires. They apply their findings to hot-wire anemometry, a technique used to measure
  airspeed, and provide numerical evaluations of the functions involved in their study.
