tldr: This article explores the effects of geological changes on the Earth's axis
  of rotation. The author investigates the consequences of the Earth's shape changing
  and how it impacts the obliquity of the ecliptic and the position of the Earth's
  axis. The study also discusses the possibility of readjustments to an approximate
  form of equilibrium and the role of internal density in these changes.
