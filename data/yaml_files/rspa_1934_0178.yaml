tldr: This study investigates the compressibility of various aqueous solutions with
  different solutes, focusing on the relationship between the solute's chemical nature
  and its effect on the compressibility of water. The results show that when solutes
  have a close chemical relationship, their compressibility curves are more similar,
  while when there is no chemical relationship, the curves are more widely spaced.
  This suggests that the nature of the solute molecule has an impact on the compressibility
  of the solvent, water.
