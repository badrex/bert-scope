tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a shock tube and a laser schlieren system
  to study the vibration-rotation energy exchange in carbon dioxide-hydrogen mixtures.
  They found that the efficiency of energy transfer between the rotation of one molecule
  and the vibration of another depends on the type of hydrogen isotope used. The results
  provide insights into the importance of long-range interactions in the coupling
  reaction and the role of rotational relaxation in the process.
