tldr: The article discusses the accidental recombination between the X and Y chromosomes
  in humans, which occasionally allows the transfer of Y-linked sequences to the X
  chromosome, leading to testis differentiation in XX males. The author also explores
  the possibility that sex determination in humans is a quantitative trait, with males
  having two active doses of the gonad-determining gene and females having one dose.
  The findings support the concept of accidental recombination as an important factor
  in the aetiology of XX males and XY females.
