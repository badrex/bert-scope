tldr: The authors studied the transport properties of touching cylinder pairs and
  square arrays of cylinders. They derived a closed-form expression for the set of
  multipole coefficients for a pair of touching cylinders and used it to estimate
  the truncation errors in the matrix solution for the square array of touching cylinders.
  This allowed them to study the array conductivity for high cylinder conductivities
  and confirm an asymptotic expression due to O'Brien. They also derived a perturbation
  formula to analyze the effect of small cylinder separations on array conductivity.
