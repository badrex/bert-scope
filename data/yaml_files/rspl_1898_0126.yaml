tldr: The author reports on experiments conducted in Calcutta to study the transmission
  of the malaria parasite, Proteosoma, to birds through mosquitoes. They describe
  the process of dissecting mosquitoes and examining the pigmented bodies found in
  their stomach walls, which change in size and nature over time. The author also
  discusses the challenges faced in rearing mosquitoes and the impact of temperature
  on their feeding habits and the progression of the disease. The study provides valuable
  insights into the transmission of malaria and the role of mosquitoes in its spread.
