tldr: The authors investigated the optical activity of thymus-nucleic acid and found
  that it is dextrorotatory. They also discovered that the optical activity is influenced
  by the acidity or alkalinity of the solution. The addition of acids or alkalies
  can change the optical activity, but the original activity can be restored by adding
  an acid or an alkali, respectively.
