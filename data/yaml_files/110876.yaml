tldr: In 1843, Professor F. Wohler discovered that aluminum can be made into a compact,
  fused form that is easily fusible and malleable. This metal has a shiny tin-like
  appearance and remains white in the air. Wohler found that aluminum in this compact
  state has similar properties to those he previously identified.
