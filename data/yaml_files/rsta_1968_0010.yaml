tldr: The authors present an effective algorithm for solving Diophantine equations
  of the type f(x, y) = Ax^2 + Bxy + Cy^2, where f is an irreducible binary form with
  integer coefficients and degree at least 3. They investigate the size of the bound
  furnished by the algorithm for the solutions of the equation and obtain the first
  effective improvement on the result of Liouville concerning the accuracy with which
  algebraic numbers can be approximated by rationals.
