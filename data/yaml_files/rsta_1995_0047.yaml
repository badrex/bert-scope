tldr: This article investigates the influence of -curve effects on the reliability
  of structural ceramics, focusing on various reinforcing mechanisms to enhance their
  performance. The authors examine the efficiency of these mechanisms in improving
  the ceramics' strength distribution and fracture toughness, using fracture mechanics
  and the Weibull distribution function as the basis for their analysis. They also
  discuss the impact of -curve behavior on strength variability and the role of different
  ceramic materials in enhancing reliability.
