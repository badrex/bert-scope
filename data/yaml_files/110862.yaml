tldr: Erasmus Wilson discovered the real structure of the ultimate muscular fibril
  in a specimen taken from a healthy man's arm. Each fibril is composed of minute
  cells, flattened at their surfaces, forming a uniform cylinder with subdivisions
  separated by transverse septa. The cells contain a transparent substance called
  myoline, which has varying refractive densities. This structure explains the alternating
  dark and luminous bands observed under a microscope and may provide new insights
  into the mechanism of muscle action.
