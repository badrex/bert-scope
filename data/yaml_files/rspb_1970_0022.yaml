tldr: This study examines the color polymorphism and breeding behavior of Arctic Skuas
  on Fair Isle. The research found that the frequency of pale morphs is higher in
  inland and northern areas, and that there is no difference in breeding success between
  different mating types. The study also discovered that dark males tend to pair earlier
  than pale ones, giving an advantage to males carrying the allelomorph for dark color.
  The findings suggest that later hatching may be favored in inland and northern parts
  of the species range, where food is scarce earlier in the summer.
