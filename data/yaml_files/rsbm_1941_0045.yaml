tldr: Alfred Joseph Clark was a prominent pharmacologist and physiologist who made
  significant contributions to the understanding of drug actions and physiological
  processes. His research focused on the isolated heart of the frog, where he studied
  the effects of various drugs and ions on heart function. Clark's work on the action
  of acetylcholine on the heart muscle and the antagonism of atropine to this action
  provided insights into the mechanisms of drug action and paved the way for future
  research in pharmacology and physiology.
