tldr: The author investigates the oscillations of the Earth's atmosphere, taking into
  account temperature variations with latitude and the existence of zonal winds. They
  discuss the limitations of the resonance theory and propose a new model that considers
  temperature variations with both height and latitude. This model aims to address
  the discrepancies found in the resonance theory and provide a better understanding
  of the solar semi-diurnal oscillation and its relation to the lunar oscillation.
