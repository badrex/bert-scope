tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the diffusion of heat spots in isotropic
  turbulence using a technique that involved producing small heat spots in the turbulent
  flow behind bi-plane square-mesh grids. They found that the transverse spatial distribution
  function of the heat spots was a Gaussian error function at all distances, in agreement
  with previous results on the temperature wake of a long thin wire. The mean peak
  temperature of the spots was found to decrease with distance downstream more rapidly
  in turbulent flow than in non-turbulent flow, suggesting that heat is probably concentrated
  in a contorted thin layer, and the shear pattern remains nearly constant in type,
  decaying aperiodically with the turbulence.
