tldr: This study compares the effects of different opioids, such as fentanyl, U-50,488H,
  and ketamine, on spinal nociceptive responses in rats and cats. The results show
  that these opioids can reduce nociceptive responses, with ketamine being particularly
  effective at lower doses. The study also suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA)
  receptors play a significant role in mediating these responses.
