tldr: The author, Captain W. de W. Abney, examines and compares various maps of the
  solar spectrum, specifically the infra-red region, and determines the wave-lengths
  of several prominent lines using mirrors and gratings. He discusses the discrepancies
  between different maps and methods, and provides accurate measurements for the wave-lengths
  of these lines.
