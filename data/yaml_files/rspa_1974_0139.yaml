tldr: This article presents methods for calculating three-dimensional laminar boundary
  layers over inclined blunt bodies, with complete incompressible results for a prolate
  spheroid at incidence. The authors describe computational procedures and observe
  the rule of the zone of dependence. The study confirms the open-type of separation
  and provides a detailed understanding of the boundary layer structure over non-spherical
  and non-conical blunt bodies.
