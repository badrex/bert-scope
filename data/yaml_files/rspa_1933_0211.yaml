tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the spontaneous ignition
  of pentane-air mixtures. The authors found that increasing pressure affects the
  ignition points, with two distinct groups of ignition points identified. The presence
  of lead tetraethyl can alter these ignition points, which has implications for the
  phenomenon of "knock" in internal combustion engines.
