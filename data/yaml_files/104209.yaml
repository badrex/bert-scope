tldr: In 1742, the Royal Society conducted an experiment to compare the standards
  of a yard and various weights to ensure their accuracy and consistency. The experiment
  involved comparing the original standards of measures and weights in the Exchequer,
  Guild-Hall, Founders-Hall, and the Tower. The results were published in Philosophical
  Transactions, providing a detailed account of the comparison process and the findings.
