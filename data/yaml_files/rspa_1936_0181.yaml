tldr: This article presents a quantitative X-ray investigation of resorcinol's structure.
  The authors discovered the arrangement of molecules in the crystal and the orientation
  of the hydroxyl groups, providing insights into the properties of organic acids,
  phenols, and alcohols. The study used X-ray diffraction to analyze the crystal structure
  and determine the positions of atoms within the molecules.
