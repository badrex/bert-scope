tldr: This article investigates the combustion products in petrol engines and their
  relation to the 'knock' phenomenon. The authors analyze the gases from the cylinder
  during different stages of the engine cycle and find that the oxygen content decreases
  rapidly during combustion, while carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide increase. They
  also study the effect of adding aldehydes and hydrogen peroxides to the fuel and
  their impact on engine performance and knock phenomenon.
