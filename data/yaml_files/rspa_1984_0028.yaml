tldr: The study investigates the changes in the core structure of a screw dislocation
  in a body-centered cubic lattice when subjected to a general applied stress tensor.
  The research finds that the core structure is primarily determined by the magnitude
  and orientation of the induced glide strain, with a smaller dependence on the glide
  stress. This explains the dependence of the Peierls stress on non-glide components
  of the applied stress tensor and has implications for the phenomenon of ductile
  fracture.
