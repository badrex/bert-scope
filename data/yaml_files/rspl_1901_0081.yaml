tldr: The author compared the readings of the Earth's magnetic field given by different
  magnetometers at various observatories in Great Britain. They employed a new method
  using a coil and a magnetic needle to measure the horizontal component of the Earth's
  magnetic field. The results showed a discrepancy with the Kew Observatory standard
  instrument, and the author discussed possible reasons for this difference.
