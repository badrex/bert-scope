tldr: The authors investigated the green pigment, uteroverdin, found in the dog's
  placenta. They discovered its chemical structure and compared it to biliverdin,
  finding similarities in their properties. Uteroverdin is derived from the hemoglobin
  of maternal blood, and its presence in the placenta may play a role in the nutrition
  of the fetus. The authors also discuss the similarities between uteroverdin and
  oocyan, another green pigment found in eggshells of birds.
