tldr: The authors studied the electron resonance spectrum of sulfur monoxide (SO)
  in the gas phase and analyzed the interactions between the unpaired electronic spins,
  electronic orbital angular momentum, and rotationally induced magnetic moments.
  They determined the values of parameters measuring these interactions and resolved
  the first and second-order contributions to the zero-field molecular constants.
  Additionally, they observed and analyzed the hyperfine structure resulting from
  the presence of silicon-29 in the sample.
