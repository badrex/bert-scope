tldr: The authors examined the absorption spectrum of gaseous aluminium monofluoride
  in the Schumann region and discovered six new singlet band-systems. They also analyzed
  the vibrational and electronic constants of the singlet states and discussed the
  atomic products of dissociation of these states. This research contributes to the
  understanding of the chemical bonding and electronic transitions in aluminium monofluoride.
