tldr: The author explains satellite-to-satellite tracking (SST) as a technique for
  probing the Earth's gravity field. SST involves tracking one spacecraft from another,
  allowing for longer contact time, reduced dependency on foreign ground stations,
  and the ability to detect small variations in the Earth's gravity field. The author
  discusses two SST tests, ATS-6/Geos-3 and ATS-6/Apollo-Soyuz, and their results,
  including the detection of gravity anomalies with a signal-to-noise ratio of up
  to 50:1. The technique has potential for further exploration of the Earth's gravity
  field and understanding of its upper layers.
