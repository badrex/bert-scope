tldr: The author examines two large Roman lead pieces with inscriptions found in Yorkshire,
  discussing their form, dimensions, and weight. He explores the possibility that
  these pieces were part of the tax paid to the Romans from the lead mines in Britain,
  providing historical context on the Roman province and its taxation system.
