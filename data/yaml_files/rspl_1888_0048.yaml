tldr: This study investigates the electromotive changes associated with the beating
  of mammalian and human hearts. The authors describe experiments that demonstrate
  the normal ventricular variation in electrical activity and how it is affected by
  the position of the heart and electrodes. The findings provide insights into the
  electrical effects of the heart and contribute to the understanding of heart function.
