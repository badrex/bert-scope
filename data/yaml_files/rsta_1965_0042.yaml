tldr: The authors discuss the concept of continental drift and propose that it can
  only occur during periods of half-turn currents in the mantle, known as orogeny.
  They also explore the relationship between mantle convection currents, the Earth's
  core, and the lack of correlation between gravity fields and these currents. Additionally,
  they address the differences in crustal movement between oceanic and continental
  crust and the possibility of oceanic geosynclines.
