tldr: The authors conducted a systematic study on the effects of oxygen and carbon
  on grain boundary segregation and intergranular fracture in molybdenum. They found
  that carbon reduces the driving force for oxygen segregation, leading to an increase
  in fracture energy and improved ductility. The study provides insights into the
  mechanisms behind recrystallization embrittlement and the role of carbon in inhibiting
  grain boundary segregation.
