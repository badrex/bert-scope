tldr: The author, William Watson, continues his research on electricity and its properties.
  He discovers that electricity can counteract and overcome the force of gravity in
  light substances. Watson also explores the effects of electricity on various materials,
  including its ability to penetrate through originally-electric substances. Additionally,
  he observes that electricity, when its forces are collected and directed, can produce
  fire and flame, particularly in inflammable vapors.
