tldr: The author applies geometric probability theory and integral geometry to study
  polymer networks and suspensions. They calculate averaged monomer densities and
  available space fractions for various types of polymers, such as single-chain polymers,
  ring polymers, and polymer aggregates. The author also calculates the averaged volume
  of the convex hull of a brownian path, providing a measure of typical polymer asymmetry.
