tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the transmission of Chinese
  Kala Azar, a parasitic disease, using sandflies as vectors. They attempted various
  methods of infection, including feeding infected sandflies to hamsters, administering
  crushed sandflies orally, and inoculating the gut contents of infected sandflies.
  Despite numerous attempts, they were unable to successfully infect the hamsters
  through these methods, suggesting that the natural transmission of the disease might
  occur through the bite of an infected sandfly.
