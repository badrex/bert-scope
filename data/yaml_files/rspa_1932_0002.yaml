tldr: This obituary honors the lives and contributions of Harold Bailey Dixon and
  Hugh Longbourne Callendar, both of whom made significant advancements in the field
  of combustion research and chemical dynamics. Dixon's groundbreaking discovery that
  prolonged drying of a mixture of carbonic oxide and oxygen with phosphoric anhydride
  renders it non-explosive when exposed to electric sparks opened up a new field of
  chemical investigation. Callendar's work on the measurement of temperature in high-speed
  gases and his development of the Callendar effect made significant contributions
  to thermometry and the understanding of heat transfer.
