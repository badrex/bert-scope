tldr: The authors synthesized anhydrides of aminoacyl glucosamines by condensing glucosamine
  with amino-aliphatic acids. They discovered that when a-bromoacyl haloids react
  with glucosamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide, the anhydrides
  are formed. This research contributes to the understanding of the synthesis and
  properties of complex proteins, specifically glucoproteins.
