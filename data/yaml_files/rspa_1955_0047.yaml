tldr: The authors studied the photochemistry of the trioxalatocobaltate III complex
  and found that both the ultraviolet and blue light peaks are photochemically active.
  They discovered that the quantum efficiency of cobaltous ion formation is twice
  the primary quantum efficiency. The study also showed that ethyl alcohol and acetone
  do not affect the photochemical quantum yield, and the reaction rate can be represented
  by a pseudomonomolecular mechanism involving water molecules. The suitability of
  the trioxalatocobaltate III complex for chemical actionometry is analyzed.
