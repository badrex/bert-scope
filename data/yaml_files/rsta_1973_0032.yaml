tldr: A team of researchers collected and analyzed volcanic gases emitted during Mount
  Etna's 1971 eruption. They found that the gas samples contained varying amounts
  of water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, and that the concentration of sulfur
  dioxide was lower during the eruption compared to previous years. The researchers
  also noted that the water content of the gases was influenced by the nature of the
  material through which the conduits passed, such as snow layers and ash-lava layers.
