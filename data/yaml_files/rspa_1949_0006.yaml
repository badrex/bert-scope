tldr: The authors measured the bond dissociation energies of Cd-CH3 in Cd(CH3)2 and
  CH3-I in CH3I using an adiabatic calorimetric system. They found the heat of hydrolysis
  of cadmium dimethyl by water and dilute H2SO4, and the heat of reaction of cadmium
  dimethyl and I2 in ethereal solution. This study helps in understanding the bond
  energies and the formation of RI compounds.
