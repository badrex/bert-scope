revised_title: Angular Distributions of Photoelectrons and Partial Photoionization
  Cross-Sections
scientific_discipline: Physics > Optics
semantic_tags:
- Photoelectron spectroscopy
- Angular distribution
- Partial photoionization cross-sections
- Asymmetry factor
- Autoionization
tldr: The authors present an experimental arrangement for measuring the angular distribution
  of photoelectrons and discuss the asymmetry factor, which uniquely describes the
  distribution. They also provide partial photoionization cross-sections for various
  wavelengths and analyze the effects of autoionization on the population of vibrational
  states.
