tldr: This article explores the determination of tide laws and the effects of lunar
  inequalities from short series of observations, such as one year. The author demonstrates
  how understanding these phenomena can improve the accuracy of tide tables and contribute
  to the study of tides as a whole. The research also discusses the comparison of
  different methods for discussing tide observations and the potential for future
  advancements in the field.
