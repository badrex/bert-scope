tldr: The article discusses a new strategy for enhancing the effectiveness of synthetic
  peptides as vaccines by conformationally restricting them to mimic the structure
  of the corresponding protein sequences. The authors replace putative amide-amide
  hydrogen bonds in peptides with covalent hydrogen-bond mimics, such as the hydrazone-ethane
  link, to create a more stable and specific binding. The study focuses on a potential
  synthetic vaccine for malaria, the repeating tetrapeptide Asn-Pro-Asn-Ala, and demonstrates
  that antibodies to the shaped malarial peptide show a strong cross-reaction with
  Plasmodium falciparum sporozoites.
