tldr: 'The study examines synaptogenesis between three classes of retinal neurons:
  photoreceptors, horizontal, and bipolar cells in Xenopus laevis. The research covers
  the developmental period from tadpole stage 48 through metamorphosis, observing
  new synaptic types and modifications of existing structures. The findings provide
  insights into the mechanisms of synapse formation and the development of the nervous
  system.'
