tldr: The authors analyze the pressure distribution in a fluid caused by the axial
  vibration of a rigid disc. They examine the effect of frequency and disc size on
  the pressure distribution and discuss the implications for sound reproduction in
  loudspeakers. The study provides insights into the design of loudspeakers to achieve
  better tonal balance and uniform pressure distribution.
