tldr: The report covers the Royal Society's activities and financial status, including
  the successful solar eclipse expedition to Grenada. The Society received a generous
  donation from Sir William Armstrong for their Scientific Relief Fund, which will
  be used to support members in need. The eclipse observations provided valuable data
  on the brightness and form of the corona, with some findings challenging previous
  assumptions about photographing the corona independently of an eclipse.
