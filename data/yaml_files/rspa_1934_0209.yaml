tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of methyl alcohol and found that
  it mainly decomposes into formaldehyde and hydrogen. They discovered that the reaction
  is mainly unimolecular and does not show a significant decrease in the rate of reaction
  at pressures down to 10 mm. The authors also determined the energy of activation
  for the reaction and discussed the molecular statistics involved in the process.
