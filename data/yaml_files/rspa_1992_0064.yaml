tldr: The authors explore the concept of the Berry phase in a slowly varying waveguide,
  which is a multidimensional analogue of the geometric phase of an adiabatic quantum
  system. They demonstrate that this additional phase can be obtained from a variational
  principle based on a slowly varying lagrangian, and discuss its implications for
  wave propagation in waveguides.
