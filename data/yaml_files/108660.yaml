tldr: The author conducted experiments on the physical properties of ice and its reaction
  to solar heat. They discovered that solar heat causes the formation of flowers-shaped
  figures within the ice, which are composed of water. The author also found that
  ice is optically uniaxial, with the axis being perpendicular to the surface of freezing.
  The experiments have implications for understanding absorption and the molecular
  structure of ice.
