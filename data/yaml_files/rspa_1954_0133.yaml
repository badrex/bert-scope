tldr: The authors studied the polymerization of N-carboxy-α-amino acid anhydrides,
  focusing on the leucine, phenylalanine, and sarcosine derivatives. They found that
  the first two anhydrides polymerize at rates dependent on monomer and initiator
  concentrations, while the sarcosine derivative has a different reaction rate. The
  authors propose a reaction scheme involving the formation of a complex between the
  monomer and a base, followed by decomposition with the evolution of carbon dioxide.
  This mechanism explains the observed kinetics and the role of catalysts in the polymerization
  process.
