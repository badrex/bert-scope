tldr: The author explains the nature of normal trichromatic and dichromatic vision,
  showing how dichromats see colors in relation to trichromats. They demonstrate that
  dichromatic isocolour lines either meet at a point representing a missing fundamental
  sensation or are parallel to a line joining the points representing the two fused
  sensations. The study concludes that the Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision
  is fundamentally correct.
