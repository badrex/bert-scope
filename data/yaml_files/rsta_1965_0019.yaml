tldr: The article examines palaeomagnetic data from the Gondwanic continents, including
  Africa, Antarctica, Australia, India, and South America, and supports the hypothesis
  of continental drift. The authors analyze the movement of these continents based
  on the palaeomagnetic latitude and orientation of rocks from various geological
  times. They also discuss the axial dipole field hypothesis and its role in determining
  the position of the geographical pole for a particular 'palaeomagnetic instant'.
  The authors conclude that the palaeomagnetic data from these continents support
  the idea of continental drift and provide insights into the movement of these continents
  over time.
