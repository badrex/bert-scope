tldr: The author, William Huggins, successfully obtained a photograph of the spectrum
  of the Orion Nebula using a 45-minute exposure. He discovered a new, relatively
  strong line in the ultra-violet with a wavelength of around 3730. This line appears
  to correspond to a line in the typical spectrum of white stars. The author suspects
  that further knowledge of the spectrum of nebulae may lead to more definite information
  about the state of things in these celestial bodies.
