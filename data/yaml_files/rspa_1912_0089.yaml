tldr: This article investigates the effect of magnetic force on the motion of negative
  ions in a gas. The authors found that at low pressures, the mass associated with
  negative ions has an average value less than that of a molecule, causing some ions
  to move as electrons. The study also shows that the electronic state prevails more
  as the electric force increases, leading to a decrease in the average mass of negative
  ions.
