tldr: This article discusses the kinetics of diffusion-limited chemical reactions
  and the dynamics of random walks in fractal and ultrametric spaces. The authors
  focus on the importance of spatial, temporal, and energetic disorder in these systems,
  and explore the implications of these concepts for understanding the behavior of
  chemical reactions in random media. They present several models for disorder and
  demonstrate how these models can be used to predict and explain complex decay patterns
  in reactions occurring in fractal and ultrametric spaces.
