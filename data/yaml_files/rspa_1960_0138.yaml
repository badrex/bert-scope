tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to determine the sign of the K-nucleus potential
  by measuring the small-angle elastic scattering of K-mesons on photographic plates.
  They compared the experimental reaction cross-section and elastic differential cross-section
  with cross-sections obtained from the optical model of the nucleus using the Klein-Gordon
  equation. The results resolved the sign ambiguity in the real parts of the A-neutron
  and A-proton forward scattering lengths, providing insights into the K-nucleon forward
  scattering dispersion relations.
