tldr: This study developed a PCR-based assay to detect intraspecific chloroplast variability
  in rice using mononucleotide microsatellite loci. Six out of 12 primer pairs revealed
  length polymorphisms, with between two and five size variants detected. The high
  level of polymorphism allows for the study of chloroplast variability at the intraspecific
  level, providing valuable information for plant population genetics and germplasm
  collection management.
