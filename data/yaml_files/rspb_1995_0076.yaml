tldr: A patient with incomplete achromatopsia and prestriate cortical lesions experienced
  impaired colour identification and colour constancy. The patient's cone photoreceptors
  had normal spectral characteristics, but their colour naming was significantly disturbed,
  particularly for blues and greens. The patient's colour constancy was impaired due
  to abnormal central processing of colour vision.
