tldr: The author analyzes magnetic disturbances at Kew, focusing on diurnal inequalities
  and non-cyclic changes. They find that magnetic disturbance is the rule rather than
  the exception and that the connection between non-cyclic changes observed during
  quiet days and magnetic disturbances is complex. The study also highlights the prevalence
  of disturbed days and the challenges in understanding the relationship between magnetic
  disturbances and Earth's magnetism.
