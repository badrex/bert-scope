tldr: The author investigates the diffusion of oxygen and lactic acid through tissues,
  focusing on the steady state and the kinetics of the diffusion process. They explore
  the factors affecting muscle recovery and the oxygen supply to active muscles, providing
  insights into the design of experimental methods in physiology.
