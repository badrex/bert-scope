tldr: The author, Servington Savery, conducted experiments to understand the concept
  of the magnetic line and the magnetic poles. He explained the difference between
  the north and south poles of a magnet and their respective attractions and repulsions.
  Savery also discussed the properties of magnets, such as their ability to attract
  iron, steel, and loadstone, and the importance of polarity in magnetism.
