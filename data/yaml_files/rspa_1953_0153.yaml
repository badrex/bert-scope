tldr: The author calculates the electrostatic energy of a system of molecules with
  permanent and induced dipole moments, taking into account polarizability. They approximate
  the contribution of electrostatic forces to the free energy of polar liquids and
  solutions, and compare their results with previous calculations by Pople. The author
  also examines the semi-macroscopic approach of Martin and Bonnor, identifying inconsistencies
  and proposing a slightly different method.
