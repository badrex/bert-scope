tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the changes blood undergoes when mixed
  with urine in the urinary bladder. They discovered that blood can form a firm coagulum
  with urine, and that the red blood cells do not dissolve in this coagulum. The presence
  of urine also prevents blood from becoming putrid. These findings provide new insights
  into the processes that occur in the human body during certain medical conditions.
