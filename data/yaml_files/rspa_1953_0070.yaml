tldr: This article presents a relativistic quantum field theory approach to study
  nuclear resonance reactions. The authors extend the theory to derive general resonance
  formulae and investigate interference between neighboring levels. They introduce
  compound propagators and derive an integral equation that accounts for the possibility
  of disintegration. The solution of this equation leads to relativistic formulae
  for a general resonance reaction.
