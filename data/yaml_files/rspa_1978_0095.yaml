tldr: The Federal Government of Germany is promoting the utilization of Spacelab through
  a systematic promotion program, focusing on materials research and process engineering.
  The program aims to assist users in studying the possibilities of utilizing manned
  space laboratories, developing first flight experiments, and providing the necessary
  infrastructure. This includes establishing a preparatory rocket program and providing
  a laboratory for materials research and an advanced technology laboratory to be
  used in Space Shuttle and Spacelab flights in the early 1980s.
