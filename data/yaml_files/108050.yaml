tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the quantity and quality of gases
  released from a thermal spring at a spa. They collected and analyzed the gas from
  the King's Bath, finding that the average amount of gas evolved was 264 cubic inches
  per minute. The author also discussed the historical evidence of similar gas evolution
  in thermal springs and the potential connection between the evolution of gas and
  the presence of certain saline ingredients and temperature in the water.
