tldr: The author discusses the importance of using precise and reliable instruments
  for weighing and determining atomic weights. They describe the use of a balance
  and Staudinger's weights, along with corrections for hygroscopic variations. The
  paper emphasizes the need for caution when using smaller samples to avoid errors
  in atomic weight calculations.
