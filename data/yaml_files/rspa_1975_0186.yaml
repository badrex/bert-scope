tldr: The article presents a solution to a mixed boundary value problem in the theory
  of diffraction, specifically for a semi-infinite half plane with a soft boundary
  condition on one side and a rigid boundary condition on the other. This mathematical
  model represents a noise barrier with an absorbing lining and helps in understanding
  the attenuation of sound in the shadow region of the barrier.
