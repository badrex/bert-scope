tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the chemical production and
  agency of electricity. The experiments supported the idea that a chemical agency
  is responsible for the effects produced in common electricity, similar to the power
  in Professor Volta's apparatus. The author also observed the production of gases
  and the oxidation of metals, suggesting that galvanism might differ only in quantity
  and intensity from common electricity.
