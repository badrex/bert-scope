tldr: The authors conducted a Monte Carlo simulation study of anisotropic systems,
  specifically focusing on the effect of translational freedom. They found that the
  system exhibits a weak first-order transition from a nematic to an isotropic phase
  when increasing the temperature. The isotropic phase has short-range spatial and
  orientational order, while the nematic phase has long-range orientational order
  and short-range spatial order. The results of these simulations were used to discuss
  the influence of the range of the anisotropic potential on the behavior of the nematogen
  and to test the validity of the molecular field approximation in the Maier-Saupe
  theory.
