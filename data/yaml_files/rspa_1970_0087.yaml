tldr: This study examines the behavior of silicone fluids during impact, finding that
  they exhibit non-Newtonian properties. The authors develop a theoretical analysis
  for a power law fluid in impact conditions and compare it with experimental results,
  providing insights into the rheology of these fluids and their potential applications
  in elastohydrodynamic lubrication.
