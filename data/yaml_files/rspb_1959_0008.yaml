tldr: The study investigates the effect of β-mercaptoethylamine on the sensitivity
  of oocytes to X-irradiation in rats. The results show that administering the drug
  before irradiation partially prevents the decrease in the population of primordial
  oocytes. The drug also prevents damage to some normal oocytes and reduces the occurrence
  of irradiation 'atresia'. The study suggests that the drug provides a 'dose-reduction'
  factor of 2 to 3 within the range of 100 to 215 r.
