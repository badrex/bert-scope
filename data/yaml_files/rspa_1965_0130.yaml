tldr: The authors examine the mechanism of deformation in assemblies of cohesionless
  particles, focusing on Rowe's stress-dilatancy theory. They discuss the assumptions
  and limitations of the theory and analyze experimental results from tri-axial tests
  on sand. The study highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of granular
  materials in various applications, such as earth masses, retaining walls, and foundations.
