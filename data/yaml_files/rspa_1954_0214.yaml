tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of iron at temperatures between 175 to
  350°C using various methods, including microgravimetric, electrometric, and film-transfer
  techniques. The authors identify different oxides formed during the oxidation process
  and discuss the growth mechanisms of oxide films on iron. They find that the growth
  rate of oxide films follows a parabolic law at higher temperatures and a logarithmic
  law at lower temperatures, suggesting different growth mechanisms for each case.
