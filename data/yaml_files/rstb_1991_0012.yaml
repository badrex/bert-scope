tldr: The authors explore the use of specularities, or highlights created by mirror-like
  reflection, as a source of geometric information for understanding surface shape.
  They develop a computational model that demonstrates how the motion of a viewer
  can generate apparent motion of specularities, which can be used to infer surface
  geometry. Psychophysical experiments support the idea that the human brain can use
  this information to perceive local surface geometry.
