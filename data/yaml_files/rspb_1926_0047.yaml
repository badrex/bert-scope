tldr: The author presents a new technique to study inter-traction, a phenomenon where
  fluids mix due to the impulsion of a force. This technique involves using a filter
  paper disc with an albuminous fluid on a cover-glass, floated on a hypertonic salt
  solution. The resulting streaming effects, called inter-traction, can be observed
  and analyzed. This research expands upon previous studies on inter-traction and
  its mechanisms.
