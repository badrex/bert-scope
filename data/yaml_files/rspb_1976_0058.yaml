tldr: The article describes the release of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) from the postsynaptic
  cells of the electric organ of Torpedo after a single nerve stimulus. The experiments
  show that ATP release is easily detected and is influenced by curare and eserine,
  indicating its postsynaptic origin. This research provides insights into the role
  of ATP in nerve activity and synaptic transmission.
