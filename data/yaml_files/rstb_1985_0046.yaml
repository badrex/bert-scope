tldr: This article investigates the electrical properties and cell types of dorsal
  root ganglion neurons. It examines the relationships between electrophysiological
  characteristics and morphological cell types of these neurons through intracellular
  recordings and dye injection in anaesthetized rats. The study also explores the
  possibility of dichotomizing peripheral afferent fibers as a basis for referred
  pain.
