tldr: 'The study examines the sperm efficiency in marsupials, particularly in the
  Virginia opossum, Didelphis virginiana. It reveals that despite a low number of
  spermatozoa stored in the epididymis, these marsupials have a high efficiency in
  terms of spermatozoa ascending to and surviving in the oviduct. The effectiveness
  may be due to two unique features: head-pairing phenomenon and spermatozoa storage
  crypts in the oviduct''s isthmus. This finding suggests that where mechanisms protect
  the sperm in the female tract, a lower sperm production level can be maintained
  without compromising fertility.'
