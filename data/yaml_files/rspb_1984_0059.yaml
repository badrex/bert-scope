tldr: This study compares the light-harvesting capabilities and quantum yields of
  zooxanthellae in light- and shade-adapted colonies of the coral Stylophora pistillata.
  Shade-adapted corals have higher pigment content, allowing them to have twice the
  light-harvesting capability of light-adapted corals. However, light-adapted corals
  have a higher quantum yield by a factor of about 1.5. The research explores the
  effects of depth and light gradients on the densities of zooxanthellae and their
  photosynthetic performance.
