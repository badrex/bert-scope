tldr: The author studied the variations in the Earth's daily mean horizontal magnetic
  force and found that these oscillations are caused by the combined actions of the
  Sun's rotation and the Moon's synodical and tropical revolutions. The study also
  reveals that the Earth has some action on the Sun or its emanations, which cause
  changes in the Earth's magnetism, and the Moon also has an effect on these magnetic
  disturbances.
