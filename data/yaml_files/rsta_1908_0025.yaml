tldr: This article presents an investigation into the effects of temperature and pressure
  on the thermal conductivities of solids, specifically focusing on the effects of
  low temperatures on the thermal and electrical conductivities of certain metals
  and alloys. The author discusses the experimental setup and methodology, as well
  as the results and their implications for electronic theories of conduction in metals.
