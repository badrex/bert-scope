tldr: The author conducted research on the involuntary muscular tissue of the urinary
  bladder and found that it has a similar composition to voluntary muscular tissue
  in the human body. The muscular wall of the bladder is made up of elongated fibers
  with fixed end-attachments, and the fibers are arranged in a similar way to voluntary
  muscles. The author also discovered tendinous intersections in the muscular fasciculi,
  which are similar to those found in the voluntary rectus abdominis muscle.
