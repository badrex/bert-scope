tldr: The article discusses the process of precise deposition of molten microdrops
  for digital microfabrication. The authors present a study of various modes of microdrop
  deposition and solidification, focusing on the conditions required for controlled
  deposition. They provide experimental results and theoretical analyses for different
  deposition modes, such as columnar deposition, sweep deposition, and repeated sweep
  deposition. The study indicates that the solidification angle, which is the apparent
  contact angle of the solidified melt, appears to be a property of the melt material,
  target material, and characteristic temperatures involved, independent of the spreading
  dynamics.
