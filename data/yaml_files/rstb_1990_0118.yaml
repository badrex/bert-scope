tldr: The molluscan fauna of the middle Pleistocene interglacial deposits at Little
  Oakley, Essex, is described, providing insights into the environment and stratigraphy
  of the area. The fauna indicates a large, well-oxygenated river, thought to be the
  ancestral Thames, and suggests a Cromerian age. The study also highlights significant
  differences in faunas at different sampling sites and discusses the implications
  of these findings.
