tldr: The authors propose a new approach to the electronic structure of molecules
  using perturbation theory, focusing on the interaction of atoms and ions in molecules.
  They argue that this method is more suitable for complex systems and can provide
  more accurate results than existing orbital theories. The approach involves using
  atomic orbitals to construct approximate atomic functions and estimate interaction
  terms, while the energies of unperturbed states are determined by more complex atomic
  functions or experimentally determined atomic term values.
