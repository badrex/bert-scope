tldr: The authors investigated the absorption spectra of water and ice, comparing
  them to the spectra of major planets. They discovered similarities between the absorption
  bands in planetary spectra and those of water, suggesting that water may play a
  significant role in the atmospheres of these planets. However, they were unable
  to identify the cause of certain unidentified absorption bands in the green region
  of the spectra.
