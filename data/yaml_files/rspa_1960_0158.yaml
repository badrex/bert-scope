tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the growth rate of surface instabilities
  in a linear pinched discharge using a high-current argon discharge. They observed
  the phenomena through Kerr cells and image converters, and their results showed
  that the Rayleigh-Taylor type of instability is likely to be the dominant process.
  The authors also compared the observed growth rates with the predicted ones from
  theoretical studies.
