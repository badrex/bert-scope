tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discusses various methods of cutting rock
  crystal for micrometers and explains how to increase the degree of double refraction
  in rock crystal. He describes three modes of cutting wedges of rock crystal and
  how they can be combined to achieve a greater separation of images. This method,
  he claims, is essentially the same as that used by M. Rochon.
