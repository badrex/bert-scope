tldr: The authors discovered and characterized three different enkephalin-degrading
  enzymes, enkephalinase Ax, A2, and B, in the brain. These enzymes are responsible
  for breaking down enkephalin peptides, which are thought to act as neurotransmitters.
  The researchers found that enkephalinase Ax and A2 generate the Tyr-Gly-Gly fragment,
  while enkephalinase B generates Tyr-Gly. These enzymes have different substrate
  specificities and regional distributions within the brain, suggesting distinct roles
  in the inactivation of enkephalins. The purification and characterization of these
  enzymes provide insights into the physiological inactivation of enkephalin neurotransmitters.
