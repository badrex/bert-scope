tldr: The author discusses the difficulty of isolating chromatin and testing the presence
  of iron in it using traditional methods. They propose a micro-chemical method using
  ammonium sulphide to detect iron in chromatin of various cell types. The study shows
  that iron is present in chromatin, but it is not combined as an albuminate. The
  author also mentions the potential applications of these findings and the need for
  further research.
