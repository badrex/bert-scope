tldr: Colonel Smythe conducted magnetic observations at the Fiji Islands in 1860 and
  1861. He determined the magnetic declination, dip, and force using instruments from
  the Kew Observatory. The results showed that the values of the magnetic elements
  differed from previous observations made at the location. The study highlights the
  importance of accurate magnetic observations for scientific research and understanding
  of Earth's magnetic field.
