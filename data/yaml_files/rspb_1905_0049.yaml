tldr: The authors, Bateson and Gregory, conducted experiments on the inheritance of
  heterostylism in Primula sinensis. They found that the characters of long-style
  and short-style have a Mendelian inheritance, with short style being dominant and
  long style being recessive. The study also explored the inheritance of flower color
  and other characters, and the authors discovered a peculiar type of Primula sinensis
  with a yellow flush, which they called "equal-styled." The inheritance of these
  traits follows the rules of Mendelian genetics.
