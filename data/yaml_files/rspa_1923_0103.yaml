tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the motion of solid bodies in rotating
  fluids. They observed that the motion of a cylinder or sphere in a rotating fluid
  creates a unique pattern of vortices and streamlines. The experiments showed that
  the fluid behaves as if a solid cylindrical body were being moved through it, providing
  insights into the complex interactions between rotating fluids and solid objects.
