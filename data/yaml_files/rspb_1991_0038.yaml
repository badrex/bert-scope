tldr: The authors studied the evolution of hypervariable minisatellites in humans
  and primates. They found that minisatellite locus MS32 is monomorphic in great apes
  and monkeys, while minisatellite MSI shows extreme variability in humans. The results
  suggest that short minisatellites are stable within the genome, and the degree of
  polymorphism at a given locus can change dramatically over a short period of evolutionary
  time.
