tldr: The authors present an approximate method for predicting properties of compressible
  boundary layers with zero heat transfer. They derive an integral of the energy equation
  by assuming the total temperature as a quadratic function of velocity and the Prandtl
  number as unity. The method is applied to various cases, including linearly retarded
  velocities and high Mach numbers, and compared with exact solutions and numerical
  integrations.
