tldr: This lecture discusses the structures of various remarkable crystals, focusing
  on the use of X-ray diffraction and Fourier methods to determine atomic arrangements.
  The author highlights the accuracy achieved in describing molecular crystals and
  the challenges in understanding chemical binding and intermolecular forces. Examples
  of crystal structures, such as benzene and vitamin B12, are provided to illustrate
  the complexity and intricacy of atomic arrangements.
