tldr: The author, Dr. John Wallis, discusses the historical connection between England
  and France through an isthmus that once joined the two countries. He presents evidence
  from various sources, including the unity of language between the ancient Gauls
  and Britains, and the discovery of strange teeth and bones in Chartham, which he
  believes to be remnants of a large marine animal. Wallis also explains the geological
  formation of the current passage between Dover and Calais, suggesting that the isthmus
  was worn away by the sea over time.
