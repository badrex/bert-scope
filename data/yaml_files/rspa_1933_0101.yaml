tldr: This article investigates the upper pressure limit in the chain reaction between
  hydrogen and oxygen. The authors find that the explosion is caused by gas phase
  deactivation of reaction chains, and they develop a theory based on ternary collisions
  to explain the phenomenon. The results show that inert gases lower the partial pressure
  of hydrogen and oxygen at the limit, and the relative speeds of the different molecules
  determine their effectiveness in deactivating the reaction chains.
