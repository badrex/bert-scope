tldr: The author discusses the use of embryonic chimeras, specifically quail-chick
  combinations, as a tool for studying the development of the nervous and immune systems.
  By grafting quail cells into chick embryos or vice versa, researchers can track
  cell migrations and interactions during embryogenesis. The author presents findings
  on neural crest development, immune system development, and the role of neural crest
  cells in head morphogenesis.
