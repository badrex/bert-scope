tldr: The author discovered a new method of generating electricity by passing hydrogen
  through certain metals at a red heat. This process involves using galvanic cells
  with different media, such as glass, porcelain, and clay, to transmit hydrogen and
  produce electricity. The author found that various metals, including platinum, can
  transmit hydrogen and generate electricity, with the amount of electricity produced
  depending on the type of metal and medium used.
