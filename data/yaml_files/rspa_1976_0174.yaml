tldr: The authors present a model for the frequency dependence of the polarizability
  of a polar molecule. They consider a harmonically bound, plane rigid rotator in
  the form of a flat disk carrying a permanent electric dipole, subjected to random
  torques from Brownian motion. The study uses the Langevin equation and linear response
  theory to calculate the electric polarizability and its variation with frequency,
  taking into account inertial effects. The results are used to represent the frequency
  dependence of the polarizability of a polar molecule with a permanent dipole moment.
