tldr: The authors investigate the chemical mechanisms behind the secretion of pancreatic
  juice and the adaptation of the digestive system to changes in food. They discover
  that the secretion of pancreatic juice is controlled by a chemical substance called
  secretin, which is produced by the mucous membrane in response to the presence of
  acid in the small intestine. This substance is then carried by the blood to the
  pancreas, where it triggers the secretion of pancreatic juice, which aids in the
  digestion and absorption of nutrients.
