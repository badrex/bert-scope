tldr: The author investigates the effects of tumor growth on the weights of organs
  in rats and mice. They find that the liver is hypertrophied in all cases, while
  the weight of the alimentary canal remains within or near the normal ratio. The
  study provides important insights into cancer metabolism and suggests promising
  directions for future research.
