tldr: Benjamin Wilson conducted experiments on electricity, focusing on the flow of
  the electric fluid through various materials and the effects of different circumstances
  on electrification. He discovered that a plus or minus electricity can be produced
  at will by carefully attending to the form of the bodies, their position, and the
  degrees of electrifying. This research helped improve the understanding of electricity
  and its applications.
