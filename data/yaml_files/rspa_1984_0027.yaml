tldr: The article investigates the response of the screw dislocation core in body-centered
  cubic metals to a general applied stress tensor using computer simulation. The Peierls
  stress, which is the resistance to the motion of a dislocation, is found to have
  a strong dependence on the shear components of the applied stress. The Peierls stress
  can vary from zero to the theoretical shear strength of the lattice, depending on
  the nature of the critical applied stress components. The findings can lead to different
  orientation dependences of the flow stress in different materials.
