tldr: The authors analyze the representations of the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group and
  determine the Poincaré spin multiplicities and irreducibility in these representations.
  They show that certain B.M.S. representations contain countably infinite direct
  sums of Poincaré spins, while others contain direct integrals of continuous Poincaré
  spins. This study helps in understanding the composition of B.M.S. representations
  out of Poincaré irreducibles and provides insights into the determination of new
  quantum numbers associated with non-connected little groups.
