tldr: Thomas Knight's paper investigates the attraction of solids with plane terminations
  and solids of greatest attraction. He extends the study to include various forms
  of solids, such as triangles, polygons, pyramids, and prisms, as well as complex
  bodies with curvilinear sections. The paper also considers solids of greatest attraction,
  exploring the effects of different density hypotheses.
