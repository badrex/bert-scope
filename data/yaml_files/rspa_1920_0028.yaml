tldr: The author conducted an experiment to determine the distribution of partial
  correlation coefficients in samples of 30. They found that the distribution of partial
  correlation coefficients is well-fitted by the theoretical distribution and that
  the dispersion of partial correlation coefficients for different attributes is not
  significantly different. This study has practical importance in various fields,
  such as psychology, vital statistics, and weather data analysis.
