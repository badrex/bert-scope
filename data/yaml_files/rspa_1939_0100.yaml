tldr: This article presents a detailed hydrodynamical theory of moving aerofoils,
  focusing on the forces and couple acting on them. The author examines the Joukowski
  aerofoil, a specific type of aerofoil, and derives expressions for lift, drag, and
  moment forces. The article also discusses the stability of a simple rectilinear
  motion aerofoil, considering factors like angle of attack and the effects of angular
  velocity and changing circulation.
