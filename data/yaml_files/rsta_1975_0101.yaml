tldr: This article examines the metamorphic processes at high temperature and low
  pressure in the metasomatized and assimilated rocks of Carneal, Co. Antrim. The
  author investigates the petrogenesis of these rocks, focusing on the mineral composition
  and the reactions that occurred during their formation. The study provides insights
  into the geological processes that shaped these rocks and their surrounding environment.
