tldr: James Thomson conducted experiments on the friction of discs revolving in water
  to improve the efficiency of turbine water-wheels and centrifugal pumps. He developed
  a formula to show the relation between the velocity of revolution, diameter of the
  disc, and mechanical work consumed in friction. He also proposed further experiments
  with a more refined apparatus powered by steam for greater accuracy and range.
