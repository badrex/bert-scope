tldr: This article discusses the structure of atomic nuclei and the role of isotopes
  in nuclear physics. The authors review the progress made in understanding isotopic
  constitution, the relative abundance of isotopes, and the application of optical
  methods to determine the presence of isotopes. They also explore the use of wave-mechanical
  ideas to explain nuclear problems and the role of energy levels in the structure
  of nuclei. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the origin of gamma
  rays and its potential to shed light on the detailed structure of the nucleus.
