tldr: This article discusses the British contribution to the SCOPE Programme on the
  Ecology of Biological Invasions, focusing on factors that determine whether a species
  will become an invader, site properties that make an ecosystem prone or resistant
  to invasion, and the development of management systems to address these issues.
  The program's findings have implications for the conservation of natural ecosystems
  and the management of invasive species in various regions.
