tldr: This article explores whether electrical currents are present during the secretion
  process in living animals and attempts to apply Faraday's discoveries to physiology.
  The author conducts various experiments using a galvanometer and different electrode
  arrangements, but no significant results are obtained, suggesting that the current's
  presence is minimal or nonexistent during the secretion process.
