  Approach'

tldr: This article presents a consistent derivation of a canonical functional integral
  representation for the propagator of a quantum system, focusing on a particle moving
  in a Riemannian space. The Hamiltonian approach is used to generalize and complete
  previous work on functional integration in quantum mechanics.
