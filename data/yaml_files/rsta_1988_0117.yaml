tldr: This article investigates the interaction of two vortex pairs in fluids, focusing
  on their chaotic behavior and dynamics. The authors demonstrate that chaotic motion
  is possible for both bound and scattering states of the system. They also discuss
  the reduction of degrees of freedom using canonical transformations and identify
  integrable cases, including a previously unknown one. The study has implications
  for understanding chaotic behavior in two-dimensional hydrodynamics.
