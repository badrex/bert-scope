tldr: The authors present a simple spatial-temporal model of rainfall where storms
  arrive in a Poisson process in space and time. Each storm consists of a circular
  rain region that moves with random velocity and disappears after a random time.
  The model helps study the properties of rainfall intensity and provides insights
  into the covariance function and storm duration at a single site.
