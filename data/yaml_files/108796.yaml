tldr: The author investigates the diurnal tides of Port Leopold in the Arctic Seas,
  using observations made during the 1848-49 expedition. They separate the diurnal
  and semidiurnal tides and analyze the effects of the sun and moon on the tides.
  The study reveals that the times of vanishing of the diurnal tide at high and low
  water move in opposite directions and become most widely separated at the time of
  the solstice. The author also deduces the constants of the solar diurnal tide and
  the mean depth of the channel of the Atlantic Sea that conveys the tide to Port
  Leopold.
