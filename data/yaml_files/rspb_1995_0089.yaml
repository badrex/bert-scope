tldr: This study investigates habitat-dependent selection in a hybrid zone between
  two European toad species, Bombina bombina and Bombina variegata. The authors conducted
  a reciprocal translocation experiment, introducing pure Bombina and Variegata tadpoles
  into different habitats. The results show that Variegata tadpoles have higher survival
  and growth rates in both habitats, especially in upland puddles. Habitat-dependent
  selection prevents the invasion of Bombina tadpole traits into the Variegata gene
  pool, and the strong linkage disequilibria in hybrid populations may be sufficient
  to maintain the integrity of the two gene pools.
