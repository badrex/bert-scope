tldr: This study examines the properties and behavior of chlorine trifluoride flames
  when burning various fuels, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon disulfide,
  water, ammonia, and halogenated hydrocarbons. The authors found that these flames
  possess unique features, such as the presence of radicals like CN and the formation
  of carbon. They also compared these flames with fluorine flames and discussed the
  effects of adding oxygen, nitrogen, and other elements to the flames.
