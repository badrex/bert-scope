tldr: This study investigates the formation of the pelvic plexus in the Mustelus species,
  focusing on the nervus collector and its relation to migration. The research reveals
  that the collector's formation is due to the migration of the fin rostrally, providing
  evidence against the excalation theory. The findings support the migration theory
  and contribute to understanding the development of the nervous system in Mustelus
  species.
