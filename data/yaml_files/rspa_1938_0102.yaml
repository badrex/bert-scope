tldr: The author investigates the Krishnan effect, a phenomenon observed in light
  scattering, and explores its connection to temperature scattering in liquids and
  solids. They argue that the assumption of structure scattering, or "cluster-like"
  structures, can explain the effect. The author also discusses the implications of
  the Krishnan effect in various substances, such as colloids, proteins, and glasses,
  and suggests that temperature scattering in solids must satisfy the reciprocity
  relation and show a Krishnan effect.
