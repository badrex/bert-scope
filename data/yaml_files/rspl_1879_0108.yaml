tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of electric light on plant
  growth and found that electric light can promote vegetation. The plants exposed
  to both electric and sunlight showed the best growth and vigor. This discovery suggests
  that electric light could be used in conjunction with sunlight to aid in plant growth
  in greenhouses.
