tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to measure the forces between molecularly
  smooth mica surfaces, revealing two types of van der Waals forces: normal and retarded.
  They found that the transition between these forces occurs when the separation between
  the surfaces is around 15 nanometers. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of real and ideal gases, as well as the strength properties of solids and the stability
  of colloids and foams.'
