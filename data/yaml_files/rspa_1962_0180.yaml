tldr: The article explains the highly perturbed spectra of the silver hydride molecule
  by analyzing its anomalous rotationless potential curve. The authors also discuss
  the influence of vibration-rotation interaction on the intensity distribution in
  the electronic spectra of diatomic molecules, providing a detailed explanation for
  the irregularities observed in the silver hydride spectrum.
