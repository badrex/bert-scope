tldr: The British Antarctic Expedition of 1907 conducted tidal observations to study
  the behavior of tides and seiches in the Antarctic region. They used a tide gauge
  apparatus to record the changes in water levels and discovered regular oscillations
  of shorter intervals than tidal periods. The collected data was analyzed to understand
  the tides' heights, phases, and harmonic constituents, providing valuable insights
  into the Antarctic ocean dynamics.
