tldr: This lecture discusses the advancements in the field of light scattering, particularly
  with the advent of lasers as light sources. It covers topics such as Rayleigh scattering,
  Tyndall scattering, and various techniques used in studying scattering phenomena,
  including the self-beat method and heterodyne techniques. Applications of these
  techniques range from studying molecular structures and fluid dynamics to medical
  research and atmospheric studies.
