tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, presents a method for determining the dispersive ratio
  of glass and computing the radii of curvature for achromatic object-glasses. He
  explains his experimental approach, which involves measuring the refractive and
  relative dispersive powers of glasses and adapting them for use in telescopes. Barlow
  also discusses the validity of an empirical rule for calculating radii and the limits
  of error in spherical aberration and dispersion.
