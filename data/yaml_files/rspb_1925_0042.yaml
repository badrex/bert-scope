tldr: The author investigates the role of cell organs, particularly the Golgi apparatus
  and nucleus, in the secretion process in the epididymis. They confirm Nassonov's
  findings that the secretion is cytoplasmic in origin and elaborate on the different
  types of secretions and their formation. The study also examines nucleolar extrusions
  and the formation of secondary nuclei in the epididymis cells.
