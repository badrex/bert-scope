tldr: This article discusses the concept of controlled heterozygosity in livestock
  and its potential benefits. The author explains how cross-breeding animals from
  different breeds can increase heterozygosity, leading to improved performance and
  higher production of meat and milk. The article also highlights various methods
  of cross-breeding and their applications in different livestock, such as sheep and
  cattle, and the importance of understanding heterosis and hybrid vigor in animal
  breeding.
