tldr: The article discusses the challenges and potential interventions for managing
  indigenous natural enemies of aphids on field crops. It highlights the importance
  of raising the natural enemy:aphid ratio through habitat modifications, advancing
  the activity of natural enemies on the crop, reducing aphid multiplication with
  plant resistance, and using pesticides selectively. The unpredictability of natural
  enemies' impact on aphids is attributed to centuries of co-evolution, and strategies
  to improve biological control are proposed, such as direct augmentation, synomones
  and kairomones, and habitat modifications.
