tldr: The authors conducted a study to understand the excretion of cholesterol in
  humans when fed on various diets. They found that cholesterol excretion can be accounted
  for by the amount taken in with food, provided the body weight remains constant.
  However, when there is a rapid loss in weight, such as during illness, the output
  of cholesterol exceeds the intake. This study highlights the importance of maintaining
  a balanced diet and stable body weight for proper cholesterol management.
