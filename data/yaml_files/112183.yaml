tldr: The author, A. Matthiessen, conducted experiments to determine the coefficient
  of expansion of mercury and water. They found that the expansion of water and mercury
  was different than previously thought, and that Kopp's values for water expansion
  might be incorrect. This research was important for understanding the properties
  of fluids and their behavior under different temperatures.
