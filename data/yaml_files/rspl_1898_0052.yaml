tldr: The author proposes a new arrangement of elements using a figure-of-eight shape
  in space, with helium, argon, and krypton falling into neutral positions between
  other elements. This arrangement helps explain the properties and positions of these
  newly discovered inert gases and predicts the existence of other elements yet to
  be discovered.
