tldr: The author's study on the lamprey's embryonic development reveals the persistence
  of the blastopore and the formation of mesoblast. The mesenteron, which is formed
  through invagination, is different from that of frogs. The mesoblast appears by
  the differentiation of yolk cells, and the blastopore remains open throughout development.
  This research contributes to understanding the primitive features of eggs that have
  not undergone significant modifications.
