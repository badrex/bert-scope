tldr: The authors studied the visible emission spectra of iodine and bromine monofluorides
  and determined their dissociation energies. They found that the iodine monofluoride
  (IF) and bromine monofluoride (BrF) molecules have different vibrational structures
  and dissociation energies. The results provide insights into the stability and properties
  of these molecules.
