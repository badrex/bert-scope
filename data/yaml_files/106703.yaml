tldr: In 1787, William Herschel shared his observations of a newly discovered comet
  with the Royal Society. He used a 10-foot reflector telescope to study the comet's
  position and appearance, comparing it to the third nebula of the Connoissance des
  Temps. He noted the comet's brightness, its central nucleus, and its diffused coma
  and faint, scattered light in the north following part.
