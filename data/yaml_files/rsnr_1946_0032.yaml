tldr: This article pays tribute to Charles Stewart Middlemiss, a geologist who was
  also an accomplished artist. It highlights his painting of the Chor Mountain and
  discusses his contributions to the Geological Survey of India, where he was required
  to illustrate his reports with drawings and sketches. Middlemiss's artistic talent
  was so exceptional that he did not need to rely on photographs, as was the option
  for those who were not skilled in drawing.
