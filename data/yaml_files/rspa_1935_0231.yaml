tldr: The authors conducted isotherm measurements of CO2 at high pressures and densities,
  using two different piezometers. They obtained data for isotherms at various temperatures
  and pressures, which can be used to study gas properties and thermodynamics. The
  results provide insights into the behavior of CO2 under extreme conditions and contribute
  to the understanding of its physical properties.
