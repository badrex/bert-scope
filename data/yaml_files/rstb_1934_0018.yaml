tldr: This study investigates the effects of climate on tsetse flies, specifically
  Glossina submorsitans and Tachinoides, in a laboratory setting. The authors found
  that factors such as temperature and humidity significantly impact the adult life,
  reproduction, and puparial stage of the flies. These findings can help improve our
  understanding of these insects and contribute to the development of better control
  methods.
