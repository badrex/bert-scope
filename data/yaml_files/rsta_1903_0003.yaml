tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the pressure coefficients of hydrogen
  and helium at constant volume and different initial pressures, as well as the vapour
  pressures of liquid oxygen and hydrogen at temperatures below their boiling points
  on the constant-volume hydrogen and helium scales. They found that helium is a more
  perfect thermometric substance than hydrogen and suggested that the helium scale
  should be used as the normal scale of temperature.
