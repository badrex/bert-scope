tldr: The authors present two methods for solving plane-potential problems involving
  specified normal gradients in engineering. They discuss the relaxation techniques
  and their applications, focusing on the physical interpretation of the problem using
  Prandtl's membrane analogy. The methods are applicable to various types of boundary
  conditions and can be used to find optimal solutions for engineering problems.
