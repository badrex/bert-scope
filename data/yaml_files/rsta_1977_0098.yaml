tldr: The article discusses the principles of lunar stratigraphy and how they can
  be applied to understand the Moon's surface evolution. It describes the different
  stages of lunar history, from the formation of the Moon to the present day, and
  how various impact events and volcanic eruptions have shaped the lunar surface.
  The authors emphasize the importance of separating stratigraphy from genetic interpretations
  of morphological features on the Moon.
