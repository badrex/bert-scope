tldr: The author examines the anatomy and growth patterns of the Victoria regia, a
  large aquatic plant. They find that its stem structure and vascular system are consistent
  with Monocotyledons, and its growth is through the continuous development of a terminal
  bud. The absence of a fibrous layer and the composition of the vascular bundles
  are discussed, providing evidence in favor of the Nymphaeaceae family being Monocotyledons.
