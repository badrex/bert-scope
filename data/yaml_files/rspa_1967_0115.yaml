tldr: This study presents a comprehensive analysis of the viscoelastic behavior of
  various supercooled liquids, including isopropyl benzene, sec-butyl benzene, and
  di(isobutyl) phthalate. The authors used high-frequency experimental techniques
  to measure the liquids' properties in the supercooled state, finding that the limiting
  shear modulus varies with temperature. The results show a striking similarity in
  the behavior of these liquids, leading to a new approach to interpreting viscoelastic
  relaxation.
