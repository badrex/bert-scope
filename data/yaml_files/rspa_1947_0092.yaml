tldr: 'The authors used an anticoincidence method to study penetrating cosmic ray
  showers and discovered two types: local penetrating showers and extensive penetrating
  showers. Local showers are groups of mesons produced in absorbers near the apparatus
  by single fast primary nucleons, while extensive showers are large cascade showers
  containing penetrating particles. This separation helps to better understand the
  properties and origins of penetrating showers.'
