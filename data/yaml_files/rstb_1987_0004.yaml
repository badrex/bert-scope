tldr: This study investigates the relationship between freshwater pulmonate snails
  and aquatic macrophytes, focusing on the snail species Biomphalaria glabrata. The
  research evaluates the snails' ability to utilize various aquatic plants, including
  whole plants, dried plant material, homogenized plant material in calcium alginate
  matrices, and water-soluble filtrates of plant homogenates. The findings support
  the theory of phased coevolution and mutualism between the snails and macrophytes,
  suggesting that these organisms have a complex and beneficial relationship.
