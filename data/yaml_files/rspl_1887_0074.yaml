tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the virus of rabies and its transmission.
  They found that the virus resides in the cerebrospinal substance and peripheral
  nerves, not just in the salivary glands. The authors also investigated the effectiveness
  of Pasteur's treatment for rabies and found that it can confer immunity in rabbits
  but is difficult to determine its effect in dogs due to their extreme refractoriness
  to infection.
