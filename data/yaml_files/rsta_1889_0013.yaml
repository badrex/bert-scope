tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to determine the atomic weight
  of gold accurately. They analyzed gold using various methods, such as precipitation,
  reduction, and spectroscopy. The author concluded that the atomic weight of gold
  is approximately 196.64, which is essential for understanding the periodic classification
  of elements and determining the atomic weights of other elements.
