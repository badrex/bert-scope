tldr: This study examines the nervous coordination between coral polyps and their
  responses to electrical stimulation. The author found that different coral species
  have varying levels of coordination and transmission of excitation between polyps.
  The concept of through-conducting pathways and interneural facilitation, which is
  valid within individual polyps, is not completely adequate for explaining the transmission
  of excitation between polyps. The author suggests that the concept of a through-conducting
  system loses its sharp outline and that the spatial spread of excitation varies
  depending on the number of electrical shocks.
