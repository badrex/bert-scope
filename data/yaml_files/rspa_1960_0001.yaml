tldr: This article investigates the effect of intermolecular forces and solvent properties
  on the vibrational frequencies of molecules. The authors conducted experiments with
  hydrogen cyanide and deuterium cyanide in various solvents and found that the dielectric
  constant of the solvent does not solely account for the observed frequency shifts.
  The study suggests that the strength of interaction with solvent molecules decreases
  in the order Br, Cl, and I, and provides insights into the form of the interaction
  through measurements in selected series of solvents.
