tldr: The study describes the technique of autotransplanting the uterus and/or ovary
  in ewes and assesses their function in the new location. The success rate of transplanting
  the ovary alone or with the uterus was higher than transplanting the uterus alone.
  Ewes with utero-ovarian autotransplants showed regular oestrous cycles and normal
  luteal phases, while ewes with ovarian autotransplants maintained the corpus luteum,
  preventing oestrus.
