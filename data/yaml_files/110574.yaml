tldr: The author, William Kelly, observed low fogs and stationary clouds in the St.
  Lawrence River while working with a naval survey team. These dense fogs usually
  have limited visibility and do not extend far from the shore or reach high altitudes.
  The phenomenon was studied in relation to the local geography and weather patterns.
