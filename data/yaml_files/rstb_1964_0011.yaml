tldr: This study investigates the relationship between stratigraphy and pollen content
  of lake deposits in the Lake District to reconstruct the history of deposition in
  relation to late- and post-glacial changes in climate and soil and vegetation in
  the drainage basins. Pollen analysis of six tarns highlights the contrast between
  regional changes due to climatic change and local changes due to topography and
  human history. The research aims to build a continuous ecological history of the
  lakes and their drainage basins by integrating data from pollen diagrams, soil changes,
  and chemical analyses.
