tldr: The DELPHI experiment at CERN's Large Electron Positron Collider aimed to study
  the final state particles produced in electron-positron collisions. The detector
  focused on three-dimensional information, high granularity, precise vertex determination,
  and particle identification. During its first year of operation, DELPHI recorded
  138,000 hadronic decays, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.3. The experiment
  provided valuable insights into particle physics and high energy physics.
