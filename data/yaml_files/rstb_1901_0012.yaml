tldr: The authors investigate the toxic properties of the Lotus arabicus plant, a
  small herbaceous plant with pink flowers native to Egypt. They discover that the
  plant contains a toxic glucoside called lotusin, which produces hydrocyanic acid
  when crushed with water. The plant is most poisonous just before the ripening of
  its seeds. The authors also isolate a yellow crystalline product called lotoflavin
  from the plant's hydrolysis. This research helps to understand the toxic effects
  of the plant and its potential impact on animals and humans.
