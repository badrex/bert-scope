tldr: The authors conducted a detailed analysis of the crystal and molecular structure
  of perylene using three-dimensional intensity data. They found that the molecule
  has small deviations from a completely planar arrangement due to intermolecular
  steric effects. The mean bond distances agree closely with valence bond and molecular
  orbital calculations. The peri-bond lengths are longer than expected, suggesting
  that the peri-bonds are single bonds and that aromatic character is localized within
  each naphthalene residue.
