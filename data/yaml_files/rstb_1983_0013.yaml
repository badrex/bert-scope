tldr: The article discusses the potential of microbial enzymes as diagnostic reagents
  in clinical chemistry. It highlights the reasons behind the growing trend of using
  microbial enzymes, such as their availability, cost-effectiveness, and ease of genetic
  manipulation. The article also provides examples of their applications, including
  the determination of body metabolites, drug and antibiotic assays, and quantitation
  of antigen-antibody reactions. The use of microbial enzymes offers a more practical
  and reliable source for clinical use compared to animal tissues.
