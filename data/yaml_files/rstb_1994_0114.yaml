tldr: This article reviews the different measures, methods, and patterns of temporal
  variability in animal abundances. It discusses the importance of understanding population
  size and density, the impact of sampling and trend errors, and the distinction between
  structural and sampling zeros. The authors provide suggestions for improving the
  basis for comparative analyses and highlight the need for clear definitions and
  appropriate data collection methods.
