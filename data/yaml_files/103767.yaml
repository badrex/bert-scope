tldr: The author presents a new method for taking levels and measuring altitude using
  a barometer. The instrument is sensitive to changes in atmospheric pressure and
  temperature, allowing for accurate measurements of height differences. The author
  also discusses potential improvements to the design of the instrument, such as using
  a portable, temperature-controlled container to minimize errors caused by temperature
  fluctuations.
