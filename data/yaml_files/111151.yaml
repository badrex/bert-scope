tldr: The author, George Newport, conducted experiments to study the role of spermatozoa
  in amphibian reproduction and the nature of impregnation. He found that the spermatozoa
  are the impregnating agents and that they do not penetrate the egg's envelope. The
  author also discovered that the chemical composition of spermatozoa is the same
  across different animal classes and that motion is essential for successful impregnation.
  He proposed a new view of impregnation, suggesting that it is caused by a unique
  force in the spermatozoa, which he called "sperm-force."
