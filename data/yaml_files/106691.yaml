tldr: This article provides a detailed account of the weather and environmental conditions
  in Lyndon, Rutland, from 1789. The author, Thomas Barker, recorded the barometer,
  thermometer, and rainfall data, as well as observations on the impact of weather
  on agriculture and local ecosystems. The article also describes a sinkhole that
  occurred in the area, which the author attributes to underground drainage.
