tldr: This article provides corrections to Darwin's equilibrium theory regarding rotating
  masses of liquid. The author highlights the similarity between the process and the
  formation of double stars, planets, and satellites. Despite the caution from M.
  Poincare, the author sees this as a potential counterpart to these celestial events.
