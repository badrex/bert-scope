tldr: The author presents a complex mathematical theory on invariants and covariants
  of binary quantics, using advanced algebraic techniques. They discuss the concept
  of asyzygetic integrals and irreducible integrals, and their relationship to the
  number and form of covariants and invariants. The author also explains the process
  of deriving the number of irreducible integrals of a given degree and the role of
  partial differential equations in this context.
