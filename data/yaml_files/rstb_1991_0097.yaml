tldr: The article discusses the unique structure and function of the compound eyes
  of mantis shrimps, specifically focusing on the color pigments and their role in
  polychromatic vision. The stomatopod eye has three distinct regions, and the six
  rows of ommatidia in the mid-band are the main subject of study. The eye contains
  brightly colored intrarhabdomal filters, lateral filters, and a photoreceptor tiering
  system. These adaptations allow the mantis shrimp to sample a broad spectrum of
  light by receptors with narrowly tuned sensitivities, suggesting the possibility
  of color vision.
