tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the factors involved in the
  development of the mammary gland. They discovered that the corpus luteum plays a
  crucial role in the growth of the mammary gland during pregnancy. The study also
  found that the hormone oestrin is not responsible for the complete development of
  the mammary gland, and that no foetal factor is needed for its full development.
  Instead, the anterior pituitary extract can induce pseudo-pregnancy and prolong
  the luteal phase, leading to complete mammary gland development.
