tldr: This paper investigates the input limits of x-ray generators, focusing on line
  focuses on stationary and moving targets. The authors present calculations and an
  experiment with a rotating anode, showing that the formula for the input limit gives
  the correct order of magnitude. The study is relevant for applications of x-rays
  in various fields.
