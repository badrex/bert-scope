tldr: The article examines the tropinone synthesis of Sir Robert Robinson and its
  impact on his career and the field of organic chemistry. Robinson's synthesis was
  a pioneering example of a calculated biomimetic synthesis, which influenced chemists'
  attitudes towards natural product structures and biosynthesis. Despite some of his
  early biogenetic suggestions being incorrect, his principles were valid and contributed
  to the development of the field.
