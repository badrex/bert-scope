tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between the structure of molecules
  and their optical anisotropy. They examine the scattering of light in gases and
  the influence of the nature and arrangement of atoms in molecules. The study focuses
  on hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide, and the results provide insight
  into molecular structure and optical properties.
