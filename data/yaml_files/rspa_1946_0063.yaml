tldr: The authors investigated the photochemical polymerization of methyl vinyl ketone
  vapour, focusing on the reaction kinetics and the role of pressure and temperature.
  They found that the reaction has an abnormal high pressure dependence and a negative
  temperature coefficient, suggesting a branched chain mechanism. The polymerization
  occurs through the splitting of the methyl vinyl ketone molecule into free radicals,
  leading to a free radical polymerization process.
