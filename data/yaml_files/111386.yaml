tldr: The author, Philip Yorke, conducted experiments to determine the formula of
  silica and its relation to other substances. He used various chemical reactions
  and substances, such as carbonates, sulfates, and borates, to find the equivalent
  of silicic acid. The results showed that there might be more than one equivalent
  for silicic acid, depending on the circumstances and the nature of the base it interacts
  with. This research contributes to the understanding of silica's chemical properties
  and its role in various chemical reactions.
