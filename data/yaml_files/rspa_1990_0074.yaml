tldr: This article presents a study on the nonlinear elastic behavior of flexible
  composites under finite deformation. The constitutive relations are derived based
  on a strain-energy density function, which is assumed to be a fourth-order polynomial
  form referring to the initial principal material coordinates. The constitutive equations
  are verified through experiments on off-axis tension, simple shear for unidirectional
  composites, and uniaxial tension for flexible composites with wavy fibers, showing
  good agreement between theory and experiments.
