tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between moduli of elasticity, thermal
  capacity, and other physical constants in various metals. They find that the cube
  of Young's Modulus varies as the seventh power of the thermal capacity per unit
  volume. This research contributes to understanding the physical properties of matter
  under stress and strain.
