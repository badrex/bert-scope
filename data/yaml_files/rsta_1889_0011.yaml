tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the photometric intensity of the
  coronal light during the solar eclipse of August 28-29, 1886. They used a telescope
  and a photometric box to compare the intensity of the coronal light with a glow
  lamp. The results showed that the light of the corona was apparently equal to 0.42
  of a standard candle at a distance of 1 foot. This study helped improve the understanding
  of the intensity and color of the coronal light during solar eclipses.
