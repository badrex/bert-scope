tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of Laplace's equation and its solutions,
  focusing on the transformation of the equation and the properties of its coefficients.
  The author also discusses the generalization of the equation and its solutions for
  non-integer values of n, comparing it to previous work by Professor Boole.
