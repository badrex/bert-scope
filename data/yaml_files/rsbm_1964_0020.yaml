tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Jvind Winge, a Danish geneticist and
  mycologist. Winge made significant contributions to the fields of genetics, cytology,
  and yeast genetics. He worked with various species, including Erophila, Lebistes
  reticulatus, and yeasts, and was a pioneer in the study of polyploidy and species
  hybridization. His work on chromosome cytology and the importance of chromosome
  homology in species hybrids laid the foundation for understanding polyploid evolution
  and speciation. Winge's research also led to the development of the 'Carlsberg II'
  barley, which was widely grown in Denmark for many years.
