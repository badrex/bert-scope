tldr: The study investigates the role of urine in sibling recognition in Atlantic
  salmon parr. The researchers found that Atlantic salmon parr can differentiate between
  the urine of sibling and non-sibling fish using electrophysiological and behavioral
  techniques. The results show that the mean recorded responses were significantly
  greater when parr were stimulated with the urine from sibling fish compared to non-sibling
  fish. This discovery highlights the importance of urine in providing information
  on kin identity in Atlantic salmon.
