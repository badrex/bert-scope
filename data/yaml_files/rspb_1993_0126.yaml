tldr: The authors developed a biophysically detailed two-dimensional network model
  of the cardiac atrium to study the effects of spatially localized inhibition of
  the Na-K pump. They found that Na overloading caused by pump inhibition can induce
  spontaneous, propagating ectopic beats within the network. This research contributes
  to understanding the mechanisms of arrhythmias and may help in developing treatments
  for atrial arrhythmias.
