tldr: The author, Samuel Dunn, observed and recorded the exact moments of time when
  the planet Venus was at external and internal contact with the Sun during the transits
  of June 6th, 1761, and June 3rd, 1769. He described various phenomena and circumstances
  that occurred during these events, which helped in determining the time of contact
  with greater accuracy. This study contributed to the understanding of planetary
  transits and the measurement of time.
