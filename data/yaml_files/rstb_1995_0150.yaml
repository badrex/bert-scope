tldr: The authors investigated the evolutionary history of New and Old World vultures
  using nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial cytochrome b gene. Their findings
  support the contention that New World vultures are not birds of prey but are more
  closely related to storks. The study also reveals that Old World vultures are polyphyletic,
  with the Aegypius-Gyps clad having evolved convergently to the more ancient Gypaetus
  and Neophron vultures.
