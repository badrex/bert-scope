tldr: This study demonstrates that Drosophila melanogaster from low-temperature selection
  lines require less food to reach a given adult size compared to those from high-temperature
  lines. The research also shows that larvae from both high- and low-temperature selection
  lines require more food to reach a given adult size when grown in the cold than
  when grown in the hot. The findings suggest that different mechanisms may be responsible
  for size changes in response to temperature and that basic aspects of thermal physiology
  are involved in these changes.
