tldr: The author suggests an alternative interpretation of the thermodynamics of elasticity
  in biological tissues, specifically muscle contraction. They propose that crystallization
  may play a role in the observed thermoelastic phenomena, which could explain the
  heat absorption and evolution found in muscle tissue. This alternative explanation
  challenges the existing theories and invites further research into the complex processes
  of muscle contraction and elasticity.
