tldr: The article argues that sea-level change, specifically global marine regressions,
  has a strong correlation with mass extinctions of marine invertebrates. The author
  presents evidence from various time scales, including large-scale correlations,
  intermediate-scale ammonoid generic diversities, and small-scale correlations with
  transgressive and regressive episodes. The study highlights the importance of sea-level
  change as a dominant causal factor in mass extinction events.
