tldr: This article discusses the concept of molecular manufacturing and its potential
  to revolutionize fabrication processes. By using direct positional control, molecular
  manufacturing can overcome limitations of current fabrication technologies, enabling
  the creation of nanoscale structures with atomic precision and high productivity.
  The author explores the implications of physical principles on the ultimate limits
  of fabrication and the role of physical law in determining technological possibilities.
