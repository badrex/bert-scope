tldr: This article investigates the hydrodynamic instability in squeeze lubrication
  films, where two parallel plates move normal to each other. The authors derive the
  Orr-Sommerfeld equation to study the flow instability and find that the nature of
  the instability can be described as disturbances moving in the instability diagram
  of equivalent wavenumber against Reynolds number. The results show that the transition
  from amplification to damping occurs more quickly when the plates are pulled apart
  compared to when they are squeezed together.
