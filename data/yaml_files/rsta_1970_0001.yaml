tldr: This article investigates the frictional traction and lubricant rheology in
  elastohydrodynamic lubrication. The authors analyze the behavior of lubricants under
  extreme conditions, such as high pressures, temperatures, and shear rates, which
  are typical in heavily loaded bearing surfaces. They explore the connection between
  frictional traction and the viscoelastic properties of lubricants, using a new model
  of a viscoelastic liquid to explain the experimental results.
