tldr: This article discusses the aerodynamic behavior of bodies in the wakes of other
  bodies, focusing on the properties of wakes that influence loads on other bodies
  placed in the wake. It includes unsteady irrotational flow outside the true wake
  and considers the wakes of three-dimensional bluff bodies. The results are presented
  in the form of an aerodynamic admittance, and experiments are used to illustrate
  the type of problem associated with determining loads on a bluff body in a wake.
