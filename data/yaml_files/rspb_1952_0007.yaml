tldr: This article discusses the concept of symbiosis, focusing on the relationships
  between micro-organisms and their hosts. The authors explore the various aspects
  of symbiotic relationships, including the unity of the organisms, the mutual modification
  of their structures, and the causal factors leading to the establishment and persistence
  of the symbiosis. They also address the challenges in categorizing symbiotic relationships
  and suggest that the term "functional field" may be more appropriate for describing
  these complex interactions.
