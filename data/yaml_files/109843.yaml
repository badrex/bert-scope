tldr: H. Davy investigates the composition and properties of fire-damp, an inflammable
  gas found in coal mines. He discovers that it is primarily composed of carburetted
  hydrogen and suggests methods for lighting coal mines safely to prevent explosions.
  Davy proposes using a safe lantern with limited air supply and a chimney to prevent
  communication with external air, as well as other designs for mine lighting.
