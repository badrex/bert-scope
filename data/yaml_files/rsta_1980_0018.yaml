tldr: This article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins and the
  rifting process, using deep drilling results and onshore surveys. The authors argue
  against the idea that sea floor spreading and plate tectonics alone can explain
  the structural evolution of a region. They present evidence from the Atlas Mountains
  of Morocco and the eastern North American and northwest African continental margins,
  emphasizing the importance of considering the whole geological environment and history.
