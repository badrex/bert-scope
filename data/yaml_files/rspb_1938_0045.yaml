tldr: This study investigates the transfer of food habits from parents to offspring
  in stick insects. Researchers found that when stick insects are raised on ivy, they
  prefer to eat ivy over privet. The study also shows that this preference can be
  passed down to the next generation, demonstrating the influence of parental food
  habits on offspring.
