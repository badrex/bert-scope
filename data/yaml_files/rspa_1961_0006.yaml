tldr: 'This article investigates the effect of electric and magnetic field orientations
  on the mean energy and drift velocity of electrons in a partially ionized gas. The
  study assumes uniform fields and a steady state for all charged and neutral species.
  The analysis is based on the Lorentz approximation and considers electron-atom collisions.
  The mean electron energy and drift velocity are discussed for two cases: constant
  mean free path and constant collision time. The Hall conductivity is expressed in
  a general form, and an additional current component is observed, which vanishes
  when the magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular to the electric field.'
