tldr: The author discovered that solid or highly viscous coatings spontaneously form
  on the free surfaces of proteid solutions and suspensions. These coatings can be
  heaped up to form visible solid masses, which can be de-soluted, coagulated, and
  rendered insoluble in the mother liquid. The author explains that these de-solutions
  and coagulations are due to the accumulation of certain dissolved or suspended matters
  at the surfaces, which lower the surface tension and surface energy of the liquid.
  This phenomenon can also be observed in non-proteid colloid solutions, fine and
  coarse suspensions, and at the interfaces of liquids forming persistent emulsions.
