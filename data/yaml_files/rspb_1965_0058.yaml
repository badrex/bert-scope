tldr: The authors studied the uptake of atropine and related drugs by intestinal smooth
  muscle of the guinea-pig in relation to acetylcholine receptors. They found that
  atropine uptake could be related to receptor-bound drug and analyzed the kinetics
  of atropine uptake and washout. The findings suggest that the uptake behaves passively
  as a slowly permeant cation and no uptake referable to acetylcholine receptors was
  detected.
