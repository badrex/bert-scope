tldr: The authors investigated the electrolytic behavior of thin films, focusing on
  hydrogen deposition. They discovered that the electrode potential and the rate of
  hydrogen ion deposition are affected by the presence of other ions in the solution.
  The study also showed that the overpotential is due to the accumulation of electric
  doublets on the electrode surface, which is different from the previously accepted
  theories.
