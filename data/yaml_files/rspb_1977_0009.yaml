tldr: The article discusses the clinical experience with the E.M.I. scanner, a revolutionary
  method for diagnosing intracranial diseases using computerized tomography. The technique
  allows for accurate diagnosis of conditions such as cerebral atrophy, hydrocephalus,
  intracranial tumors, and abscesses without risk or discomfort for the patient. The
  E.M.I. scanner has become a valuable tool in the investigation of patients with
  suspected intracranial diseases, providing detailed information that often surpasses
  conventional neuroradiological investigations.
