tldr: Thomas Andrew Knight's experiments demonstrate the importance of leaves in plant
  growth, development, and fruit ripening. He shows that a fluid similar to the true
  sap descends through the leaf-stalks and that the growth of immature leaves depends
  on matter provided by mature leaves. Knight also observes that fruit growth relies
  on mature leaves, and trees that retain their leaves during winter can ripen fruit
  during that season.
