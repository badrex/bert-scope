tldr: The authors measured the acoustic impedance of liquid helium-3 in the temperature
  range of 0.05 to 1.3 Kelvin. They found that the acoustic impedance increased abruptly
  at around 0.3 Kelvin, which is in good agreement with Landau's theory of a Fermi
  liquid. This theory explains the change in impedance due to the propagation of a
  new mode of sound called "zero-sound."
