tldr: The study investigates the physiological and environmental regulation of stable
  isotopes and trace metals in the coral Montastrea annularis. The research reveals
  strong seasonal variations in 13C and magnesium contents, which are linked to changes
  in growth rate. The findings indicate that metabolic effects cannot be ignored in
  paleo-environmental interpretation of carbonate skeletal chemistry, and stable isotopes
  are useful tools in understanding overall carbon metabolism of photosynthetic calcifying
  organisms.
