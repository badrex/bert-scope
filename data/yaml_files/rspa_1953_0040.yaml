tldr: The author conducted experiments on the effects of impurities, specifically
  indium, on the penetration depth in superconducting tin. They discovered that adding
  impurity significantly alters the penetration depth in both zero magnetic field
  and when a magnetic field is applied. This finding challenges the London theory
  of superconductivity. A new phenomenological theory is proposed, which adequately
  describes the observed effects of impurities on the penetration depth and provides
  an explanation for the absolute magnitude and anisotropy of the penetration depth
  in pure tin.
