tldr: The article investigates the role of phosphotransferase-mediated syntheses of
  fructose 1-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate in the growth of Escherichia coli
  on fructose. The authors describe the isolation and properties of mutants impaired
  in a component of the phosphotransferase system, PtsP, and PtsX, which affect the
  utilization of fructose in the bacteria. The study provides evidence for two routes
  through which external fructose can be utilized by and transformed to fructose 1,6-diphosphate
  in E. coli.
