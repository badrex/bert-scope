tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the structure of impulse corona in
  a rod/plane gap, focusing on the positive corona. They measured the dissipation
  of space charge following the growth of impulse corona discharges and determined
  the spatial distribution and magnitude of the space charge, along with the associated
  electric field. The results provide insights into the behavior of corona space charge
  and its impact on the development of high voltage sparks in asymmetric electrode
  configurations.
