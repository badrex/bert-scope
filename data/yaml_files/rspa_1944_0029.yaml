tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the transition effect of penetrating
  showers, which is crucial for understanding penetrating showers. They observed the
  effect and found it to agree with the theory of Hamilton, Heither, and Peng. The
  results showed that the transition effect is an essential factor in interpreting
  penetrating showers and improving previous results.
