tldr: This study examines the nature of exsolution lamellae in an extremely slowly
  cooled clinopyroxene (augite) using high-resolution electron microscopy. The research
  identifies three sets of lamellae, which probably formed mainly during the cooling
  process, as amphibole, pigeonite, and hypersthene. The findings help establish the
  relation between the phases and the cooling history of the rock, providing insights
  into the nucleation processes in crystalline materials.
