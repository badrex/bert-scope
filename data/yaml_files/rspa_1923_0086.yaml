tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the rate of water evaporation from
  clay, sand, and wool fabric. They discovered that the evaporation rate can be affected
  by factors such as the vapor pressure of water, temperature, and capillarity. The
  authors also found that clay and wool have different moisture relations, with clay
  having a more significant effect on the evaporation rate due to its imbibitional
  water content.
