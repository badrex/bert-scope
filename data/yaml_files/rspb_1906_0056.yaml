tldr: The author discusses the role of nerve endings and special excitable substances
  in cells, particularly in muscular and nervous tissues. They examine the effects
  of various poisons on these tissues and argue that the traditional view of nerve
  endings being more susceptible to certain poisons may not be accurate. The author
  presents recent observations that challenge this theory and suggest a need for further
  investigation.
