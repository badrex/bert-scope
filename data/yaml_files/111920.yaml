tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of phosphoric acid on
  liver function and urine composition. They found that injecting phosphoric acid
  into the circulation caused a saccharine state in the urine, indicating a perverted
  condition of the liver's processes. The unnatural state of the blood induced by
  the acid seemed to promote the conversion of amyloid substance into sugar. The author
  also observed that injecting the acid into the portal system caused the blood to
  solidify and stop the circulation, leading to the absence of sugar in the urine.
