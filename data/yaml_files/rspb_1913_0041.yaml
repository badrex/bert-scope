tldr: The author investigates the excystation process of Colpoda cucullus, a type
  of protozoa, and the properties of its cyst membranes. They find that excystation
  is influenced by temperature and pH, and that the cyst membranes are not made of
  starch, cellulose, glycogen, or paraglycogen. The study provides insights into the
  behavior of protozoa in the soil and their response to environmental factors.
