tldr: The authors studied the conversion of one strain of Diaporthe perniciosa into
  another by examining the behavior of DHC and DHF in separate and associated cultures.
  They found that viable hyphal tips from the advancing mycelium of DHC usually develop
  into DHF, and minute fragments of older mycelium can also give rise to DHF when
  grown in fresh medium. This research provides insights into the factors responsible
  for the conversion of DHC into DHF.
