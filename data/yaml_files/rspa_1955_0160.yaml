tldr: The author presents an exact solution of the Navier-Stokes equations for a two-dimensional
  fluid flow with a fluctuating stream velocity. The study focuses on an infinite
  plane porous wall with a constant velocity component normal to the wall. The findings
  demonstrate how velocity fluctuations affect the skin friction and the kinetic temperature
  of the wall, providing insights into the behavior of boundary layers under fluctuating
  conditions.
