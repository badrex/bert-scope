tldr: The author examines the North American Chydorus faviformis and other honeycombed
  taxa from different continents. They discover that these taxa are distinct species,
  with differences in morphology and geographical distribution. The study provides
  detailed descriptions of these species and challenges the concept of cosmopolitanism
  in taxonomy and evolution.
