tldr: The author, H. C. Sorby, developed a method of using a spectrum microscope to
  analyze animal and vegetable coloring matters. By combining a spectroscope with
  a microscope, Sorby could distinguish colored minerals in thin sections of rocks
  and meteorites. This technique allowed for the identification of colored substances
  and their properties, providing valuable information for the field of chemistry.
