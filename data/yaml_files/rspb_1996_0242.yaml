tldr: The study conducted by Bergelson, Purrington, Palm, and López-Gutiérrez found
  that transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana plants with a mutant acetolactate synthase
  gene, which confers resistance to chlorsulfuron herbicide, had a 34% reduction in
  lifetime seed production compared to their susceptible counterparts. This suggests
  that the fitness cost of resistance is due to the pleiotropic effect of the introduced
  gene rather than other potential costs associated with plant transformation. The
  results have implications for the risk assessment of transgenic crops.
