tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of tar, lamp-black, and
  oil on the conduction of electricity, particularly in relation to lightning. They
  discovered that these substances can act as insulators, preventing damage to wooden
  structures and ships during lightning strikes. However, they also found that objects
  close to these insulators may still be at risk of being struck by lightning.
