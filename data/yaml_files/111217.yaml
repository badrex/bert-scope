tldr: This study examines the non-periodic variations of temperature in Toronto, Canada,
  from 1841 to 1852. The author compares these variations with records from Europe
  to understand the meteorological activity and climate patterns in the region. The
  research also introduces the concept of Chrono-Isothermals, which represent temperature
  variations over time, and highlights the unique features of the North American winter
  and the variability of temperature throughout the year.
