tldr: This article investigates the stress-driven migration of point defects to a
  crack in materials. The authors derive the elastic interaction energy between a
  crack tip and nearby point defects, estimating the kinetics of migration in the
  stress field of a loaded crack. They analyze the transient depletion of solute atoms
  and the steady-state loss of point defects during irradiation, considering self-interstitials
  and vacancies. The study provides insights into crack propagation in irradiated
  materials and the importance of stress-driven migration in materials science.
