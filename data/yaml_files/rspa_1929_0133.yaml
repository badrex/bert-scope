tldr: This article presents a detailed study of radioactive decay and the penetration
  of beta-particles into a simplified one-dimensional nucleus. The authors analyze
  the conditions of continuity and energy to determine the chance of penetration,
  finding that it depends on whether the energy of the incident particle is equal
  to a characteristic energy of the nucleus. The study also highlights the resonance
  effect in the penetration process.
