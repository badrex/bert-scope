tldr: This article discusses the development of fibre-optic-based fluoroimmunosensors
  for trace analysis, which use the specificity of antibody-antigen interactions and
  the sensitivity of laser-excited fluorimetry to perform remote and in situ measurements
  of chemical concentrations. The authors describe the use of passive and regenerable
  sensors for measuring naturally fluorescent compounds and large proteins, demonstrating
  their potential for various applications, including continuous monitoring and hostile
  or inaccessible locations.
