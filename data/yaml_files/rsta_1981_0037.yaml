tldr: The article discusses the use of high-resolution 13C and 15N nuclear magnetic
  resonance (NMR) techniques for analyzing the structure and dynamics of various complex
  polymers and materials. Examples include the characterization of carbon fiber precursors,
  cross-linked resins, lignin metabolism, and polymeric blends. These non-destructive
  analyses provide valuable information about molecular structures and chemical reactions
  in solid-state materials.
