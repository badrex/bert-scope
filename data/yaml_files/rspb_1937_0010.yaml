  and Unparasitized Hosts

tldr: The author investigates how the parasitoid wasp Trichogramma distinguishes between
  parasitized and unparasitized hosts. They find that the wasps use their chemical
  sense to detect a deterrent odor provided by the parasite, rather than a specific
  smell from the host itself. This discovery helps to understand the complex communication
  and behavior of these insects in their natural environment.
