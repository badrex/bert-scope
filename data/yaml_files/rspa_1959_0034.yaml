tldr: The authors study the flow of impurities to an edge dislocation in metals, specifically
  low-carbon steels. They develop a model that considers both steady-state and time-dependent
  conditions, and their findings help explain the behavior of impurities in the core
  region of dislocations. The research has implications for understanding strain aging
  and the mechanical properties of metals.
