tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the swelling of charcoal when immersed
  in lower alcohols. They found that the expansion of charcoal provides a measure
  of the lowering of surface energy. The results showed that the relations between
  the percentage linear expansion and adsorption values approximate to the Schofield-Rideal
  equation of state. The authors also investigated the molecular expansion curves
  of the alcohols and found that the influence of intermolecular forces determines
  the distribution of molecules in the films.
