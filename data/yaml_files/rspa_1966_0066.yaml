tldr: The authors present a simplified method for calculating the diffraction patterns
  of crystals with antiphase domains, focusing on the alloy AuCu<sub>3</sub>. They
  correct previous work by Wilson and extend the model to account for differences
  in interfacial energy between domains of different types. The study provides insights
  into the structure and properties of gold-copper alloys.
