tldr: This study examines the chemical and isotopic systematics of the Caledonian
  intrusions in Scotland and Northern England, providing insights into the magma source
  regions and magma-crust interactions. The research finds that the intrusions were
  derived from both mantle and crustal sources, with the majority being dominated
  by recycled continental crust. The findings contribute to the understanding of the
  petrogenesis of the British Caledonian Granitoids.
