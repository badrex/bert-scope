tldr: The authors describe the synthesis of graft polymers by using the photodegradation
  of polymethylvinylketone (PMVK) to form free radicals that initiate polymerization
  of a vinyl monomer. They demonstrate this process using acrylonitrile, methyl methacrylate,
  and vinyl acetate, resulting in graft polymers with long chains of PMVK chemically
  attached to monomer units of different chemical structures. This method offers a
  way to synthesize graft polymers with a wide range of chemical compositions.
