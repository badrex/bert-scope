tldr: This paper reviews the techniques available for predicting the manoeuvring characteristics
  of ships, focusing on design aspects. It discusses the limitations of current methods,
  such as free model testing and constrained model testing, and suggests that a more
  direct approach to determining ship responses may be a promising avenue for further
  research.
