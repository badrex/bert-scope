tldr: This review discusses the development and applications of transition metal atom
  chemistry, focusing on the use of free atoms of transition metals in chemical synthesis.
  The author outlines the partnership between spectroscopic studies and preparative
  scale studies of atom reactions, covering the preparation of organometallic compounds,
  coordination compounds, metal cluster compounds, and catalysts from transition metal
  atoms. The potential of using atoms on an industrial scale is also considered.
