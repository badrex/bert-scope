tldr: The authors present a method to obtain prolongation structures for a class of
  nonlinear evolution equations solvable by the inverse method of Ablowitz, Kaup,
  Newell, and Segur. They demonstrate how to deduce Backlund transformations from
  the invariance properties of associated Lie algebras and vector fields induced on
  a manifold. This method helps understand the underlying algebraic structure of the
  equations and can be applied to equations with soliton properties.
