tldr: This study examines the shell color and banding polymorphisms of the land snail
  Cepaea nemoralis along the coast of south-west England. The researchers found that
  the frequency of five-banded morphs increases from north to south, while mid-banded
  morphs decrease. The findings suggest that similar selective forces are at play
  in this region, and further investigation into two unique areas with unusual morph
  frequencies is conducted to understand the causes behind these patterns.
