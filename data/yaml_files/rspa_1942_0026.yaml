tldr: The author investigates the molecular movements and structure of rubber-like
  polymers, specifically gutta-percha and polychloroprene. They found that major changes
  in molecular configuration due to rotation around single bonds occur at the crystallization
  point, leading to the flexibility and elasticity of these materials. The author
  also explains the low crystallization temperatures of these polymers and correlates
  their mechanical properties with molecular behavior.
