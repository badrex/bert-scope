revised_title: 'Heat Conduction in Highly Rarefied Air: A Pivotal Study by William
  Crookes'

tldr: In this study, William Crookes examines the transfer of heat across air of varying
  densities and pressures. He discovered that heat conduction is almost independent
  of pressure, but as pressure decreases, the rate of cooling slows down significantly.
  This research has implications for understanding heat transfer in rarefied environments,
  such as in outer space.
