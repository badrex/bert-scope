tldr: The author, A. Matthiessen, conducted experiments on the reaction of nitrous
  acid on aniline and found that phenylic alcohol is converted into nitrophenassic
  acid due to the presence of free nitric acid. The author also tried the action of
  nitrous acid on other organic bases, such as ethylaniline, and observed a base that
  appeared to be ethylamin.
