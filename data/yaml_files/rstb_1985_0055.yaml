tldr: This study investigates the autonomic responses and analgesic effects of stimulating
  the periaqueductal grey matter (PAG) in rats. The researchers found that stimulation
  in the dorsal PAG evoked a defense reaction, including cardiovascular and respiratory
  changes, and increased the latency of the tail flick response. In contrast, stimulation
  in the ventral PAG produced analgesia without visceral alerting. Both autonomic
  and analgesic effects were blocked after bilateral lesions of the ventrolateral
  medulla. The study suggests that the analgesia from dorsal PAG stimulation is part
  of a stress response mediated through the ventrolateral medulla.
