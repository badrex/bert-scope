tldr: This book review discusses Adrian Vaughan's biography of Isambard Kingdom Brunei,
  focusing on the personal contrast between Brunei's father, Marc Isambard Brunei,
  and his son, Isambard Kingdom Brunei. The review highlights the book's descriptions
  of the contractual warfare on I.K. Brunei's major projects and the relationship
  between Brunei and Scottish marine engineer John Scott Russell. The reviewer also
  mentions the omission of references and footnotes, which they find unscholarly.
