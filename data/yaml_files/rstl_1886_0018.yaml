tldr: The author examines the vascular system and blood vessels of Mustelus antarcticus,
  a type of skate, to better understand the vascular system in vertebrates. They describe
  the efferent and afferent branchial arteries, the formation of arterial loops, and
  the role of epibranchial arteries in the development of the dorsal aorta. This research
  contributes to the study of the evolution of vascular systems in vertebrates and
  sheds light on the anatomy of fish.
