tldr: The authors developed a method to measure the diffusion velocity of substances
  in dilute solutions using a porous diaphragm. They applied this method to study
  the diffusion of potassium chloride in water, finding that the rate of diffusion
  is an explicit function of the concentration and the diffusion coefficient. This
  method provides a more accurate and controlled way to study diffusion in various
  solutions.
