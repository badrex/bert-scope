tldr: This study found that great tits, Parus major, sacrifice their health for increased
  reproductive effort. A positive correlation was discovered between total prefledging
  brood weight and both intensity of Haemoproteus blood parasite infection and heterophile:lymphocyte
  (H:L) ratio. Experimental reduction of clutch size led to decreased intensity of
  Haemoproteus parasitemia, indicating that great tits accept immunosuppression to
  increase their reproductive investment.
