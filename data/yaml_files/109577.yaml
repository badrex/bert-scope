tldr: The author, Benjamin Count of Rumford, observed a curious phenomenon on the
  glaciers of Chamouny, where pits filled with water were found on the ice's surface.
  He explained that warm winds caused the water's temperature to rise, making it heavier
  and causing it to sink to the bottom, melting the ice. This phenomenon challenges
  the idea that water is a conductor of heat. The author also discusses the equal
  temperature of water at the bottom of lakes and the difficulties in explaining this
  phenomenon using the current understanding of heat conduction in fluids.
