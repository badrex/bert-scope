tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray crystal analysis of pentaerythritol tetra-acetate
  and determined its crystal structure. They found that the central carbon atom in
  the molecule has a four-fold alternating axis, which is in line with chemical and
  physical considerations. The molecule has a tetragonal bipyramidal class symmetry,
  and the crystal structure consists of two molecules per unit cell.
