tldr: The article discusses the relationship between parasitism, polymorphism, and
  evolution in social insects, such as bees, wasps, and ants. It explores how parasites
  can affect social organization and mating systems, leading to increased genetic
  variability among colony members. The authors also examine the role of parasites
  in shaping the transmission of diseases within and between colonies, as well as
  the impact of parasitism on colony behavior and division of labor.
