tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effects of an electric field on the
  combustion of dry carbonic oxide-oxygen mixtures. They discovered that the electric
  field influenced the flame's behavior, with flames moving faster towards the negative
  pole. The results suggest that the electric field affects the distribution of ions
  and particles in the flame, leading to differences in combustion rates.
