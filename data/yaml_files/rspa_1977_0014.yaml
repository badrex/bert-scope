tldr: This study investigates the impact of grain protrusion on the movement of particles
  in a stream bed. The researchers found that the dimensionless threshold stress for
  grains resting on the top of a flat bed in a turbulent stream is significantly lower
  than previously reported values. The experiments suggest that protrusion of individual
  bed grains is an important factor in determining their stability and should be considered
  in future studies of sediment transport and stream bed dynamics.
