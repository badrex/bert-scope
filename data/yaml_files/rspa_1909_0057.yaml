semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors present simplified formulas for calculating the electrostatic energy
  stored between electrified spherical conductors and the attractive or repulsive
  forces between them. These formulas are particularly useful for understanding wireless
  telegraphy systems and can help engineers optimize the energy stored in these systems.
