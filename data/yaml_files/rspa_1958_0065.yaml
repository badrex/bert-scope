tldr: This article investigates the thermal decomposition of diethyl ether and the
  effect of inhibitors, such as nitric oxide and propylene, on the reaction rate.
  The study finds that nitric oxide reduces the rate of decomposition, while larger
  amounts of propylene accelerate the process. The authors analyze the reaction products
  and kinetics, concluding that the inhibited reaction is likely a molecular decomposition,
  while the uninhibited reaction is predominantly a chain reaction. The nitric-oxide-induced
  reaction is suggested to be initiated by the generation of radicals in an attack
  on ether molecules.
