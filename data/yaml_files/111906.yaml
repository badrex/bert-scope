tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, studied the reaction between cyanate of ethyl and
  urea, resulting in the formation of a new crystalline compound. This compound contains
  two molecules of ethyl-cyanic acid instead of the usual one molecule found in other
  urea reactions. The new substance is soluble in alcohol, ether, and dilute acids,
  and its formation reveals the diatomic character of urea.
