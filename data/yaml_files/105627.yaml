tldr: A young boy experienced hearing loss after the malleus and incus bones in both
  ears dropped out due to a severe fever and inflammation. The boy could still be
  affected by loud noises but was deemed unlikely to recover his hearing. The cause
  was believed to be an abscess affecting the tympanum, possibly due to a malignant
  or ulcerous sore throat.
