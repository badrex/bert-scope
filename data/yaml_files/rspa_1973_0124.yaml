tldr: The authors develop a perturbation theory for projected states and demonstrate
  that it satisfies the Schrödinger equation. They propose a new series for the perturbation
  theory and discuss its convergence criteria. The method is applied to the Lipkin
  model, a two-level many-body problem, and is shown to provide a good approximation
  and better convergence than ordinary perturbation theory.
