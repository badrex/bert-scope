tldr: The study found that in the marine mussel Mytilus, there is a high frequency
  of individuals with more than one mitochondrial DNA genome, with the majority possessing
  two genomes, F and M. The F genome is more common in females, while the M genome
  is more common in males. This sex-biased heteroplasmy could be due to factors such
  as replicative advantage, mutation rates, and somatic segregation.
