tldr: Wilfrid Edward Le Gros Clark was a prominent British anatomist who made significant
  contributions to the fields of anatomy, comparative primate anatomy, and neuroanatomy.
  He conducted extensive research on the tree-shrew and the spectral tarsier, which
  helped advance our understanding of primate evolution. Le Gros Clark also studied
  the macro- and micro-anatomy of the tree-shrew brain, leading to investigations
  of the cortical and other connections of the thalamus and lateral geniculate body.
  His work laid the foundation for further studies on sensory pathways and the connections
  between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex.
