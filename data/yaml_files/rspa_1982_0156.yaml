tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the temperature and dynamics of
  implosion focus in detonation waves. They used a quartz Hilger spectrograph to measure
  the radiation intensity and fitted it to a black-body spectrum. The results showed
  that the temperature increased from 10,500 to 13,200 for gas runs and reached 15,000
  to 17,000 for explosive runs. The emissivity of the radiating gas was close to unity,
  confirming the black-body behavior. Numerical studies using the random choice method
  and strong-shock theory provided insights into the implosion process.
