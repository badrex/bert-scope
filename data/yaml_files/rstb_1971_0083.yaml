tldr: This article discusses the active transport of sodium and hexoses in living
  tissues, focusing on the interactions between these substances and their role in
  cellular metabolism and transport. The author explores the different specificities
  of hexoses and their impact on energy availability and transport mechanisms in the
  columnar epithelial cells of the intestine. The article highlights the importance
  of understanding these interactions for a better understanding of the movement of
  salt and water in living tissues.
