tldr: The article discusses two dating methods, archaeomagnetic and thermoluminescent,
  for determining the age of archaeological materials. Archaeomagnetic dating measures
  the ancient direction of the Earth's magnetic field recorded in baked clay, while
  thermoluminescence measures the age of pottery independently of existing chronologies.
  These methods can help refine existing chronological frameworks and provide valuable
  information for archaeologists and geophysicists.
