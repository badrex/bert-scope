tldr: The author examines the viscous theory of glacier motion and the plasticity
  of glacier ice. He conducts experiments in the Mer de Glace, measuring the relative
  motion of different parts of the glacier using trigonometry. The results show that
  the motion is gradual and uninterrupted, with the speed increasing as the distance
  from the sides of the glacier increases.
