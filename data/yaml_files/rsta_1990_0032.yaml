tldr: This article discusses the history of solar observations in ancient China, focusing
  on sunspot observations and their impact on understanding solar activity over the
  past 2000 years. The author reconstructs a new sunspot catalogue using various sources,
  including official histories and local gazettes, and analyzes the power spectrum
  of solar activity. The study reveals the significance of the 10.62-year Schwabe
  cycle and the potential influence of a 210-year cycle on solar activity and future
  forecasting.
