tldr: This article explores the impact of conflict and receiver bias on the evolution
  of signal forms in animals. The authors use an artificial neural network model to
  study how conflict between senders and receivers influences the development of signals.
  They find that as conflict increases, signals become more costly and conspicuous,
  reflecting the importance of understanding receiver biases in the evolution of animal
  communication.
