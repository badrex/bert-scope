tldr: The authors conducted experiments to demonstrate the polarization of electrons
  by scattering. They used a thin foil of high atomic number material and a beam of
  fast electrons. The results showed a change in intensity when the foil and measuring
  apparatus were rotated, indicating the presence of electron polarization. The findings
  support the theory of Mott scattering, which predicts the conditions under which
  electron polarization can be observed.
