tldr: The authors construct examples of infinite groups where Sylow theorems fail,
  demonstrating limitations of generalizations made to certain restricted classes
  of infinite groups. They show that under specific assumptions, Sylow subgroups may
  not have complements, and there may be continuously many mutually non-isomorphic
  Sylow subgroups. The examples provided are metabelian and of exponent 6, highlighting
  the need for further research in "good" Sylow theorems and Hall theorems for infinite
  groups.
