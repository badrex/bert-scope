tldr: This article compares the notable magnetic disturbances in 1858 and 1859 at
  Kew and Nertschinsk, investigating the causes and patterns of these disturbances.
  The author finds that these disturbances are periodical phenomena, governed by solar
  hours, and suggests a possible connection between the disturbances' origins and
  the critical localities of the Earth's magnetism. The study contributes to the understanding
  of the relationship between solar activity and geomagnetic phenomena.
