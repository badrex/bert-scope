tldr: This article discusses the strain patterns and geological structure of the Pyrenean
  Chain, a deformed part of the Earth's crust. The authors describe the main characteristics
  of the major deformation, including the distribution of elementary modes of deformation,
  the geometry of folding, and the orientation of principal strain axes. They also
  analyze the effects of tectonics on adjacent regions, such as the Aquitanian platform,
  which can be observed up to 400 km away from the chain. The study provides insights
  into the overall geometry of the Pyrenees and its implications for understanding
  the chain's formation and deformation processes.
