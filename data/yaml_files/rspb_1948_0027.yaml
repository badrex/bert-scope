tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frog muscle fibers to determine the electrical
  properties, including resistance and capacity, of the muscle fiber membranes. They
  found that the membrane capacity of muscle fibers is about five times higher than
  that of other cell membranes, which contributes to the slower electrical time scale
  of muscle fibers. The results provide insights into the factors affecting muscle
  fiber excitation, propagation velocity, and other physiological properties.
