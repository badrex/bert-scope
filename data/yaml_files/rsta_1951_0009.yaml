tldr: This study investigates the chemical reactions in the 'end-gas' of a spark-ignition
  engine that lead to engine knock. The authors used a specially designed electromagnetic
  gas-sampling valve to follow the sequence of reactions and analyzed the sampled
  gas for intermediate and final products. They found that substances which form free
  radicals in the engine cylinder act as pro-knocks, while additives like lead tetraethyl
  can reduce knock by inhibiting the formation of peroxides and aldehydes.
