tldr: Female lions can identify potentially infanticidal males from their roars, allowing
  them to protect their cubs from threats. The study found that female lions with
  cubs can distinguish between the roars of their own resident males and unfamiliar,
  potentially infanticidal males. This ability helps them detect and categorize unfamiliar
  intruders within their territory, protecting their cubs from infanticidal males
  and expelling intruding females.
