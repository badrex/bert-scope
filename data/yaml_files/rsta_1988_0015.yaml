tldr: This article explores the spectroscopy of molecular ions, specifically focusing
  on doubly charged ions. The authors examine current interpretations of molecular
  doubly charged ion spectra and discuss the application of a two-electron symmetry
  rule in the double photoionization of argon. They present new experimental data
  on double ionization and discuss various techniques for studying doubly charged
  ions, such as photoion-photoion coincidence spectroscopy and photoelectron-photoelectron
  coincidence spectroscopy.
