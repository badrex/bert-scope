tldr: This article explores the electrostatic potential energy of carbonate and nitrate
  crystals of the calcite type. The authors calculate the energy using two parameters,
  the rhombohedral angle and the ratio of the distance between an ion and an adjacent
  metallic ion to the distance between an ion and the neighboring ion. The results
  provide insight into the equilibrium configuration of these crystals, which is essential
  for understanding their properties and behavior.
