tldr: The author studied the developmental forms of Trypanosoma brucei in gerbils,
  observing changes in the parasite both inside and outside of red blood cells. They
  found that the parasite undergoes a cycle of development, with some forms appearing
  in the spleen, bone-marrow, and axillary glands. The study also noted the presence
  of free chromatin granules in the blood, which may represent a first stage in development.
