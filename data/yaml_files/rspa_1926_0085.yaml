tldr: In 1926, E. V. Appleton and his team conducted experiments to study the behavior
  of radio waves in the atmosphere. They discovered that radio waves could be reflected
  back to Earth from a layer in the upper atmosphere, now known as the ionosphere.
  This finding revolutionized long-distance communication and paved the way for modern
  wireless technology.
