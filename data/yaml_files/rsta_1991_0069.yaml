tldr: The authors develop a coherent structure model of the turbulent boundary layer,
  focusing on the outer and wall region subsets. They analyze the contributions of
  coherent motions, such as large-scale motions, typical eddies, and their interactions,
  to the Reynolds stress. The model predicts Reynolds number dependence and provides
  insights into turbulence production and evolution in boundary layers.
