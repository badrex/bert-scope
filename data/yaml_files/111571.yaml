tldr: A. W. Hofmann and Dr. George Merck discovered a new volatile organic acid, sorbic
  acid, from the berries of the mountain ash. They found that it has remarkable properties
  and can be converted into a crystalline acid. The discovery of sorbic acid led to
  the study of isomerism and the establishment of a new series of organic acids.
