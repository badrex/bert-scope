tldr: Humphry Davy conducted experiments using electricity to study the chemical properties
  of water and various materials. He discovered that negative electricity could produce
  fixed alkali and acid matter, which he found to be present in materials such as
  glass, marble, and even distilled water. This research contributed to the understanding
  of electrolysis and the role of electricity in chemical reactions.
