tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how individuals judge the elasticity
  and viscosity of soft materials. They found that people can distinguish small differences
  in viscosity and compression moduli, but the methods used to measure these properties
  were different from classical psychophysical methods. The study aimed to compare
  the subjective judgments of individuals with their objective physical measurements.
