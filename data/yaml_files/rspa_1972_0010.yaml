tldr: The authors study the nonlinear evolution of a marginally unstable plane parallel
  flow to a two-dimensional disturbance. They find that bursts can occur in various
  regions of the flow, and that skewed disturbances with angles greater than about
  1 degree to the main flow direction will ultimately burst. This research has implications
  for understanding turbulent spots in boundary layer transition.
