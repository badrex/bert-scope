tldr: The author conducted experiments on tin crystals to study the influence of the
  difference in orientation of two crystals on the mechanical effect of their boundary.
  They found that the critical stress required for deformation varies with the angle
  between the crystal orientations, with the highest stress occurring when the angle
  is 90 degrees. This research helps to understand the properties of crystal boundaries
  and their impact on the mechanical behavior of materials.
