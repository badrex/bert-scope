tldr: This article discusses the research on the structure, organization, and classification
  of fossil reptiles, specifically focusing on two small specimens found in Klipfontein,
  Fraserburg. The author examines the skeletal remains and compares them to known
  reptile types, noting similarities to Theriodonts and Dicynodonts. The findings
  suggest that these remains may belong to a distinct group separate from Cynodontia
  and Gomphodontia.
