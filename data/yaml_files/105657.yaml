tldr: The author, William Hudson, presents a treatise on the study of fungi, discussing
  their unique characteristics and proposing a new hypothesis about their propagation.
  He examines various types of fungi and their growth patterns, questioning the traditional
  methods of plant propagation and suggesting that fungi may have a different mode
  of rise, evolution, and nourishment compared to other plants. The treatise also
  includes proposals for publishing the figures of all the fungi growing in Bavaria,
  colored after nature, and carried out under the direction of the Electoral Academy
  at Munich.
