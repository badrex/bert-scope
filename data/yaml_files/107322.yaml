tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, conducted experiments on the tendrils of various
  plants, such as the Virginia creeper, ivy, and common vine, to understand their
  movements and how they attach to objects. He discovered that light plays a significant
  role in the direction and behavior of tendrils and stems, helping plants find support
  and protection. This research provides insight into plant adaptation and survival
  mechanisms.
