tldr: This study compares the variation and evolution of Class I Mhc in sexual and
  parthenogenetic geckos. The research focuses on the parthenogenetic species Hemidactylus
  garnotii and Lepidodactylus lugubris, as well as their sexual relatives. The results
  show that parthenogenetic species have little or no Class I diversification, while
  sexual species have high levels of variation. This suggests that parthenogenetic
  species may have adequate antigen presenting diversity to survive and compete with
  sexual relatives despite lacking sexual recombination as a source of genetic variation.
