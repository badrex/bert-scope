tldr: The authors study the dynamics of monopoles with minimal symmetry breaking using
  geodesic flow on a totally geodesic submanifold of a moduli space of solutions to
  Nahm's equations. They analyze the metric on this submanifold and numerically integrate
  the resulting geodesic equations, providing a physical interpretation of the geodesics.
  The study focuses on monopoles with SU(3) symmetry and their spectral curves.
