tldr: This article proposes a physical model for the inelasticity of concrete, focusing
  on microcracking and its interaction with the material's plasticity, known as elastoplastic
  coupling. The model accounts for the composite nature of concrete and its influence
  on microcrack development. A thermodynamic approach is used to describe the coupling
  between the material's plasticity and its elastic degradation. The model predicts
  that concrete exhibits stable crack growth under uniaxial compression and unstable
  crack growth under uniaxial tension, in agreement with experimental observations.
