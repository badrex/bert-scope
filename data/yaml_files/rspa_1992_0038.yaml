tldr: The author presents a similarity analysis of creep indentation tests for nonlinear
  elastic and nonlinear viscous materials. The study shows how an entire process of
  indentation can be made to depend on the solution of just one boundary-value problem
  in scaled variables and with a fixed geometry. This approach simplifies the analysis
  of axisymmetric hardness tests and provides valuable information about the connection
  between the depth of penetration and the radius of contact, as well as the variation
  of penetration with time in a creep test under dead load.
