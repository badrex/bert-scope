tldr: The article presents a study on the scattering properties of particle assemblies,
  specifically spheres, using the Rayleigh approximation. A system of linear simultaneous
  equations is derived to calculate the scattering properties of the assemblies, and
  numerical calculations are performed to illustrate the properties of the scattered
  light. The results are compared with previous work, and a diagnostic technique is
  proposed to determine the size, complex refractive index, and number of particles
  in a long chain agglomerate.
