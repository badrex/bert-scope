tldr: The study investigates the growth and reproduction of Antarctic flowering plants,
  Deschampsia antarctica and Colobanthus crassifolius, in the Antarctic botanical
  zone. The research confirms that these two species are the only native flowering
  plants in the area and are confined to the Antarctic Peninsula-Scotia Ridge sector.
  The findings show a high degree of vegetative uniformity in both species, with variations
  in plant size and vigor. The study also highlights the importance of temperature
  and daylength in regulating the growth and reproduction of these plants.
