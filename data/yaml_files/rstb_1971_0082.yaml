tldr: The article discusses the role of cyclic AMP in regulating ion and water movement
  across epithelia, specifically in salivary glands. The authors found that 5-hydroxytryptamine
  (5-HT) and cyclic AMP work together to control fluid secretion in salivary glands.
  They also discovered that 5-HT may act directly to increase anion movement, while
  cyclic AMP stimulates cation transport. This research provides insights into the
  complex mechanisms behind fluid transport and its control in living tissues.
