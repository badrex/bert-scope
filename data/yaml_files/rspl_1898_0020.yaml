tldr: The author, Jagadis Chunder Bose, demonstrates the production of a dark cross
  in the field of electro-magnetic radiation using various materials, such as chilled
  glass, wood, and crystals. This phenomenon can be used to study the rotation of
  the plane of polarization and detect the rotation produced in a magnetic field.
