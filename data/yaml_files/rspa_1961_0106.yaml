tldr: This article investigates the optical properties and band structure of cadmium
  selenide single crystals. The researchers used thin sublimed plates to study the
  absorption coefficients, refractive indices, and birefringence of the material.
  They discovered sharp absorption bands in the visible spectrum and found that the
  band structure of cadmium selenide is similar to that of cadmium sulfide. The study
  provides valuable information for understanding the properties of semi-conducting
  materials and their applications.
