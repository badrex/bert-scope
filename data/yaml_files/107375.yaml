tldr: The author investigates the dispersive power of the atmosphere and its effect
  on astronomical observations. They discover that the apparent altitude of stars
  and the sun varies depending on the color of the light, leading to disagreements
  in latitude calculations. The author also explores the impact of telescope design
  and the use of colored glasses on observational accuracy.
