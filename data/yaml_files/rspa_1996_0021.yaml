tldr: The authors investigate the dynamics and stability of cubic autocatalytic chemical
  waves in three-dimensional systems, focusing on planar, cylindrical, and spherical
  waves. They find that the dynamics of the wavefront depend on the ratio of the diffusivities
  of the reactants and the autocatalyst, as well as the system geometry. The study
  provides insights into the evolution of perturbations and the conditions for patterned
  front formation in different systems.
