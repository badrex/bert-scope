tldr: The author examines the morphology and development of Phylloglossum Drummondii,
  a small Australian plant. They discovered that the plant's development depends on
  the size of its tuber, and that its roots and tubers have an unusual exogenous origin.
  The study of this reduced form of a plant group with limited vegetative development
  offers interesting insights into plant biology.
