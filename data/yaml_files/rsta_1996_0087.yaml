tldr: This article discusses the simulation and study of three-dimensional cellular
  structures, such as soap froth, and the effect of liquid fraction on their structure.
  The Surface Evolver program is used to explore the influence of surface constraints.
  The authors also investigate the structure of wet and dry foams and the transitions
  between them, as well as the potential for ordered structures in foam science.
