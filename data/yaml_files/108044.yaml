tldr: The author, Samuel Solly, discovered previously unobserved fibers ascending
  from the anterolateral columns of the spinal cord to the cerebellum. These fibers
  connect the motor tract of the spinal cord to the cerebellum, providing a better
  understanding of the nervous system's functions and divisions.
