tldr: This article explores the twistor description of massive fields using cohomological
  methods. The authors demonstrate how the Penrose transform can be used to describe
  solutions of the Dirac equations on Minkowski space in terms of cohomology classes
  on a related five-dimensional complex manifold. This approach provides a cohomological
  version of integral formulae involving functions of two twistors, offering a better
  understanding of massive fields in the context of twistor theory.
