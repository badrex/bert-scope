tldr: This article presents a new method for measuring surface cracks in metals using
  alternating current electric fields. The Crack Microgauge instrument eliminates
  the need for calibration with test blocks and can be used on various materials.
  The method provides a more accurate interpretation of crack size and geometry, improving
  the detection and monitoring of metal fatigue and flaws in components for machines
  with high reliability requirements.
