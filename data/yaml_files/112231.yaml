tldr: The author examines the forces responsible for large magnetic disturbances and
  investigates the role of earth-currents in these events. They analyze the magnetic
  disturbances of 1859 and 1860, concluding that peaks and hollows in the disturbances
  represent small and rapid changes in the intensity of the whole disturbing force.
  The author also suggests that two independent forces may act simultaneously during
  disturbances, and that earth-currents observed during these events are induced currents
  due to rapid changes in the Earth's magnetism.
