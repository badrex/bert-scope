tldr: The study examines the effects of estrogenic hormone treatment on the structure
  and function of the mammalian testes. It shows that estrogen causes a decline in
  the number of spermatids and spermatocytes, while spermatogonia are less affected.
  The research also demonstrates that administering FSH and LH can restore normal
  conditions and that estrogen's effect on the testes is likely due to a deficiency
  of FSH. The study provides evidence of Sertoli cells metabolizing sterols during
  spermatogenesis.
