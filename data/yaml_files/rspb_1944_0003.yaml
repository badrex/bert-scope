tldr: The author conducted a physico-chemical study on induced changes in the morphology
  of Bacterium lactis aerogenes. They discovered that the size distribution of cells
  in cultures giving snake-forms follows an exponential law, which suggests that cell
  division is delayed due to a less probable conjunction of events inside the cell.
  The study also found that the balance and adaptive variation of enzyme processes
  in bacteria play a crucial role in determining cell morphology.
