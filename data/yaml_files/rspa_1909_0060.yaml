tldr: The author investigates the wave motion of a revolving shaft and the transfer
  of angular momentum in a beam of circularly polarized light. They derive equations
  for the wave motion and discuss the energy transmission in the shaft, considering
  both natural and forced velocities. The study has implications for understanding
  wave mechanics and material science.
