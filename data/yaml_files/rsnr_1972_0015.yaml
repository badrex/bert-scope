tldr: This article examines the history of bifocal spectacles and challenges the widely
  held belief that Benjamin Franklin was the sole inventor. It explores the roles
  of Franklin, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Benjamin West in the development of bifocals
  and presents evidence that suggests other individuals may have been involved in
  the invention. The article also discusses the impact of bifocals on the lives of
  these historical figures and their contemporaries.
