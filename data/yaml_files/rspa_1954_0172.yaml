tldr: This article explores the behavior of cnoidal waves and bores in fluid dynamics.
  It presents a new approach to understanding stationary gravity waves, using cnoidal
  wave-trains instead of sinusoidal ones. The study also investigates the relationship
  between wave resistance, wave length, and wave amplitude, and how these factors
  affect the formation of bores in flowing streams.
