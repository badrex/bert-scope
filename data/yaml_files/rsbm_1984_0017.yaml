tldr: Kurt Albin Mothes was a pioneering plant physiologist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of nitrogen metabolism in plants. His research focused on the
  formation and metabolism of alkaloids, detoxification of ammonia, transport of amino
  acids, and the role of cytokinins. Mothes also made notable contributions to plant
  physiology, biochemistry, and the study of nitrogen metabolism in eastern Europe.
  His work has had a lasting impact on the field of plant science.
