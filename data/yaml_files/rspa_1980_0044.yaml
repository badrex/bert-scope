tldr: The authors study the Weierstrass-Mandelbrot fractal function, which is continuous
  but non-differentiable and has no scale. They explore its properties, including
  its Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension, and discuss its applications in various fields,
  such as quantum mechanics and fractal phenomena.
