tldr: The author investigates the fate of the blastopore in newt embryos (Triton cristatus)
  and finds that it does not form a neurenteric canal. Instead, the blastopore remains
  open and eventually becomes the anus. The study provides insights into the development
  and morphogenesis of vertebrates.
