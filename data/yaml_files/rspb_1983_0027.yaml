tldr: The article proposes a model for the retino-tectal projection, which assumes
  that axonal growth proceeds predominantly in the direction of the maximal slope
  of a guiding substance. The spatial distribution of this parameter results from
  the interaction of components of retinal axons and tectal components. The model
  can explain the generation of primary projections and some features of regulation,
  such as independence of projections on neural pathways and observations on the innervation
  of rotated pieces of tectum.
