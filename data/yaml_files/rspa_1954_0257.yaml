tldr: The author presents a simpler derivation of the fundamental form of an expanding
  universe based on Whitehead's gravitational theory. By considering a distribution
  of matter in flat space-time, the author obtains an equivalent form of Rayner's
  model through straightforward calculations. The resulting Whitehead-Rayner universe
  model accounts for gravity and is invariant under Lorentz transformations.
