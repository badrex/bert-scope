tldr: The author, Harold Jeffreys, discusses the oscillations of the atmosphere and
  the role of temperature variations in these oscillations. He explains that his method,
  which assumes that the temperature at a fixed point remains unchanged during an
  oscillation, is not applicable to free oscillations. He also addresses criticisms
  made by G. I. Taylor and clarifies the differences between his approach and Taylor's.
