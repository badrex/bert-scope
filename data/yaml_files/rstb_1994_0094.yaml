tldr: The article investigates the efficiency and evolution of water transport systems
  in higher plants through a modeling approach. It analyzes the effectiveness of protostele
  and siphonostele in water conduction by performing numerical simulations. The results
  demonstrate that the hydrodynamic behavior of a plant axis depends on the relative
  amount of conducting tissues and the arrangement of xylem within the axis. This
  study provides insights into the role of water transport in stelar evolution.
