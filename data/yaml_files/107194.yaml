tldr: The author conducted extensive observations on the marine barometer along the
  coasts of New Holland and New South Wales. They noticed a correlation between the
  movement of the mercury in the barometer and the setting in of winds from the sea
  and land. This study helped in understanding the effects of sea and land breezes
  on the barometer, providing valuable insights into weather patterns and wind behavior
  in the region.
