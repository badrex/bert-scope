tldr: This article discusses the principles and methods of fracture mechanics, focusing
  on the determination and definition of fracture toughness. It covers topics such
  as the size effect, compliance, linear-elastic crack tip stresses, and standard
  specimen types used in fracture toughness measurements. The article also highlights
  the importance of valid measurements and the influence of material properties and
  testing conditions on fracture behavior.
