tldr: This article discusses the challenges in analyzing continuous sea-level records
  at coastal stations to assess secular coastal movement in the vertical. It highlights
  the limitations of traditional techniques used to obtain raw data and the need for
  more advanced methods to account for oceanographic, meteorological, and terrestrial
  factors. The author presents a regression analysis to determine the secular variation
  of sea level and its relationship with various factors, such as air pressure, wind
  stress, and the nodal tide.
