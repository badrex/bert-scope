tldr: The author presents a crystallographic study of the monoclinic double sulphates
  containing ammonium. They describe the five remaining double sulphates in the series
  with R as ammonium and M as nickel, cobalt, manganese, copper, and cadmium. The
  study includes measurements of the crystals, comparison of axial angles and axial
  ratios, and an analysis of molecular volumes. The author also discusses the optical
  properties of the crystals and their cleavage.
