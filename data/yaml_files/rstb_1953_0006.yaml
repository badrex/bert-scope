tldr: The author examines the unique shell morphology and adaptations of the bivalve
  species Pinna carnea Gmelin, which lives vertically embedded in soft substrata.
  The shell's triangular outline and posterior extension of the mantle provide protection
  and allow for frequent repair of damage. The author discusses the species' unique
  features, such as waste canals, pallial organ, and pallial retractors, which contribute
  to their success in their environment.
