tldr: This article examines the idea of local isotropy in the smallest scales of turbulent
  scalar and velocity fields, as proposed by Kolmogorov. The author discusses the
  concept of a nonlinear cascade of kinetic energy towards smaller scales and the
  two similarity hypotheses for homogeneous, isotropic turbulence. Recent experimental
  studies support Kolmogorov's hypothesis, showing that spectral local isotropy is
  a property of the finest scales of turbulence in a homogeneous fluid. However, small-scale
  local isotropy is vulnerable to anisotropic forcing at large scales and can be rapidly
  destroyed in a stably stratified fluid when buoyancy forces are dynamically important.
