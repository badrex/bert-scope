tldr: This article describes the case of a young boy, Thomas Hale, who was born with
  extraordinary physical attributes and rapid growth. Despite being only two years
  and eleven months old, he was already 3 feet 9 inches tall and weighed over four
  stone. The boy's strength, voice, and understanding were compared to that of a six-year-old
  child. His large and developed genitalia also attracted attention. The article discusses
  the boy's measurements, physical abilities, and the circumstances of his birth and
  upbringing.
