tldr: The author conducted a study on the temperature classification of stars by comparing
  the spectra of various star types. They found that stars on the same temperature
  horizon have similar temperatures and absorption conditions, and observed differences
  in the spectra of stars on opposite sides of the temperature curve. This research
  helped refine the understanding of star properties and their classification.
