tldr: 'The article describes the design of novel protease inhibitors by modifying
  the active centre of c1-antitrypsin. Researchers used site-directed mutagenesis
  to create variants of the human serine protease inhibitor c1-antitrypsin. They addressed
  three questions: alleviating the susceptibility of c1-antitrypsin to oxidative inactivation,
  altering the specificity of inhibition by modifying the active-centre sequence,
  and identifying essential residues at or near the active centre for the molecule''s
  function. The study resulted in the production of several c1-antitrypsin variants
  of potential therapeutic value, particularly for pulmonary emphysema caused by hereditary
  or acquired c1-antitrypsin deficiency.'
