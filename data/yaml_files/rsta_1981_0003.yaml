tldr: This article presents a theoretical model for the sliding of glaciers in the
  absence of cavitation. The authors analyze the flow and temperature problems in
  the basal ice and bedrock, and propose a relation between the basal velocity and
  the resistance to motion by the bedrock. The model considers the effects of bedrock
  roughness and regelation, and provides estimates for the sliding law. The study
  highlights the importance of further research to improve the model's accuracy and
  incorporate additional factors, such as moisture in the ice.
