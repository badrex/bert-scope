tldr: The author presents a new design for telescopes that reduces encumbrance and
  improves stability. By cutting or removing most of the tube, the telescope can be
  more easily managed and directed at stars. The author also provides solutions for
  potential issues, such as maintaining the position of the eyepiece and using a lantern
  to find the objective glass in the dark. This design aims to make telescopes more
  accessible and user-friendly for astronomers.
