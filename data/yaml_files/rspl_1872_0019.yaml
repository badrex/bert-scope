tldr: The author discusses their observations on the temperature of the Arctic Sea
  in the neighborhood of Spitzbergen. They found warm water and an open sea at certain
  seasons of the year as far north as 81Â°. The author suggests that this warm water
  may flow from the circumpolar region, indicating a circumpolar sea. Further investigation
  of these warm currents and their impact on oceanic theories and weather patterns
  in the northern hemisphere is needed.
