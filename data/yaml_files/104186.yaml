tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of population and marriage statistics
  in the Dutch provinces of Holland, West-Friesland, Dort, Delft, Delftshaven, Leyden,
  and Amsterdam during the 18th century. The author, W. Kersseboom, provides a comprehensive
  overview of birth, death, and marriage rates, as well as the probable lives of widows
  and the duration of marriages. The study aims to offer a well-grounded supposition
  of the number of souls in these provinces and to demonstrate the usefulness of statistical
  methods in understanding population dynamics.
