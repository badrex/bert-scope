tldr: The authors studied the naturally infected dog strain of trypanosome and its
  development in Glossina morsitans. They found that the strain belongs to the same
  group as T. gambiense and T. brucei in terms of its mode of development in the tsetse
  fly. The trypanosome causing disease in man in Nyasaland is likely a weak strain
  of the latter species.
