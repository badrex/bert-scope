tldr: This article presents a study on the cooling rates of stony meteorites using
  244Pu fission track thermometry. The research focuses on the H chondrites and their
  parent asteroids, providing insights into the early thermal environments of meteorites
  and their parent bodies. The study also discusses the principle of the multiple-detector
  method used to analyze the fission track densities in meteorites.
