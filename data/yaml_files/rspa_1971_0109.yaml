tldr: This article presents a study of long-range interactions between rare earth
  ions, specifically focusing on Nd ions in crystal structures. The authors measure
  these interactions using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy and
  discuss the role of superexchange interactions in the magnetic properties of these
  materials. The findings provide insights into the nature of long-range interactions
  and their impact on energy transfer, thermodynamic properties, and critical phenomena
  in rare earth ion systems.
