tldr: The author, Christopher Gullet, discovered that elderberry has a strong smell
  that repels insects and flies. He experimented with using elderberry to protect
  plants from caterpillars, blights, and crop-destroying flies. Gullet found that
  elderberry could be used to preserve crops of cabbage, wheat, and turnips from damage.
  He also suggested that elderberry could be used to protect fruit trees from insects
  in the future.
