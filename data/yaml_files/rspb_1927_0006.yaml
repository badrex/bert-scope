tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-ray sterilisation on the oestrous cycle
  and reproductive system in mice. The results show that X-ray exposure can cause
  disintegration of Graafian follicles and eliminate the cyclic structures of the
  ovary, but the accessory organs still experience periodic changes. The study also
  explores the effects of sterilisation at different stages of pregnancy and the mechanisms
  of hormonal regulation in the oestrous cycle.
