tldr: This article explores the photographic sensitivity and reciprocity law at low
  temperatures. The authors conducted experiments to examine Gurney and Mott's theory
  on latent image formation. They found that at low temperatures, there is no reciprocity
  failure, and the sensitivity of photographic materials does not significantly decrease.
  This suggests that only an electronic process occurs at low temperatures, with electrons
  freezing in and the ionic process following upon warming up.
