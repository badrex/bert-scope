tldr: The authors examine three strains of trypanosomes causing dourine and discover
  morphological differences between them. They find that Strain A has posterior nuclear
  forms and "short stumpy" forms, while Strains B and C are more similar to each other
  and have longer free flagellated forms. The authors reconsider the nomenclature
  of the parasites and suggest that Strain A may correspond to the type to which the
  name T. equiperdum was given.
