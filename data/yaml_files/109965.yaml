tldr: The Earl of Morton, F.R.S., shares a unique observation on the hybridization
  of a male Quagga and an Arabian mare. The resulting offspring display features from
  both species, particularly the Quagga's distinctive stripes. This raises the question
  of how traits from the dam can be passed on to the progeny, even when the sire does
  not possess them.
