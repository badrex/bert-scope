tldr: The author examines the flight of a rifled projectile in air, focusing on the
  forces acting on the projectile and the resulting trajectory. They explain how air
  resistance and the spin of the projectile affect its path, leading to a helical
  motion. The study provides insights into the behavior of projectiles and their stability
  during flight.
