tldr: This article presents a method for determining the refractive index and vibrational
  absorption band intensities of liquids in the infrared using attenuated total reflexion.
  The authors apply this method to benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, bromoform,
  tetrabromoethane, and carbon disulphide, providing valuable data for evaluating
  theories about solvent effects on absorption bands and estimating the intensities
  of vibrational bands of the liquids.
