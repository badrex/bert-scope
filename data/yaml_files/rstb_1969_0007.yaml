tldr: This article discusses the geological evolution of the British Solomon Islands,
  focusing on the processes of faulting and folding that have shaped the islands.
  The author uses photogeological interpretations to analyze the structures of San
  Cristobal, Santa Isabel, and Malaita, concluding that these islands have experienced
  similar structural evolution despite their different appearances. The study provides
  insights into the formation of these islands and their future development.
