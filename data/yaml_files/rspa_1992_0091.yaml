tldr: This article investigates the transient phenomena in the initiation of a mechanically
  driven plane detonation. The authors use the Euler equations to model the behavior
  between the piston and shock, and they employ the Random Choice Method combined
  with time-operator-splitting for numerical solutions. The study reveals various
  phases of gas motion, including quasi-steady weak detonations, fast flames, and
  the spontaneous appearance of a reaction shock, which contribute to the build-up
  of a ZND-wave of Chapman-Jouguet strength.
