tldr: The authors present a method to modify the energy-momentum tensor to remove
  infinite self-energies of point-particles without affecting the equations of motion.
  They demonstrate this method for electromagnetic and meson fields, showing that
  the modified tensor leads to a finite integral of energy and momentum over any space-like
  surface. This approach helps avoid spurious infinities and provides a finite total
  energy and momentum.
