tldr: This article explores the evolution of Greater Antillean Anolis lizard communities
  using phylogenetic approaches. The author demonstrates that anole communities on
  islands like Jamaica and Puerto Rico have similar structures and have evolved through
  nearly identical sequences of ancestral communities. The driving force behind this
  adaptive radiation is believed to be interspecific competition. The habitat specialization
  hypothesis is tested, suggesting that the addition of new species to a community
  leads to shifts in habitat use, which can result in morphological adaptations. The
  author's experimental findings support the existence of ecological interactions
  among sympatric anoles and the role of habitat shifts in their evolution.
