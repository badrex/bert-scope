tldr: This article examines the extensional and compressional tectonics associated
  with convergent plate boundaries, focusing on the Aegean Arc and the Andean Cordillera.
  The study reveals that the compressional deformation in the crust above subduction
  zones is strongly controlled by stress conditions along convergent boundaries, and
  extensional tectonics are associated with subduction zones.
