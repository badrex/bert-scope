tldr: This study presents a data-based mathematical model to assess the epidemiological
  consequences of HIV transmission through heterosexual, intravenous drug use, and
  perinatal transmission in New York City. The model helps to understand the dynamic
  interaction of these transmission routes and provides insights into the HIV epidemic
  in the city. The results suggest that long-term precise estimates of the future
  number of AIDS cases will require accurate evaluation of key variables and their
  uncertainties.
