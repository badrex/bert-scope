tldr: This article discusses the challenges of analyzing accidents and identifying
  human error in complex, rapidly changing industrial systems. It addresses the nature
  of causal explanations and the ambiguity of rules used in accident analysis. The
  author also analyzes the concept of human error and its relation to human adaptation
  and learning, concluding that the identification of errors as a separate class of
  behavior is becoming increasingly difficult in modern work environments.
