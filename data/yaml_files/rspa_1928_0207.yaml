tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the arc spectrum of cesium and discovered
  the hyperfine structure of its lines. They developed a theory that explains the
  origin of these doublets, assuming a nuclear spin of one half quantum. By correlating
  the difference in the separation of the hyperfine structure doublets in the lines,
  they showed that a ratio of the magnetic to the mechanical moment of the nucleus
  about twice as great as the corresponding ratio for the electron would account for
  the observed frequency differences.
