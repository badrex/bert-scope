tldr: The article discusses the geological development of the New Hebrides archipelago,
  focusing on the island arc system's growth, tectonic movements, volcanic episodes,
  and sedimentation processes. The New Hebrides islands are part of the ridge systems
  parallel to the east coast of Australia, resulting from crustal plate interactions.
  The article outlines three main volcanic episodes and the associated carbonate sedimentation,
  which have influenced the islands' geomorphology and the chemical nature of the
  exposed rocks.
