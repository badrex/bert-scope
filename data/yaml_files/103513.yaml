tldr: Arthur Dobs observed the lunar eclipse of February 2, 1728-1729, at Castle-Dobbs,
  Ireland. He used a nine-foot glass and a monthly pendulum clock to measure the eclipse
  and determine the longitude of the location. The observation included details of
  the moon's eastern limits and penumbra.
