tldr: This study investigates the impact of ions, particularly magnesium and potassium,
  on ciliary movement and energy metabolism in ciliated cells. The author demonstrates
  that magnesium and potassium play crucial roles in regulating the rate and duration
  of ciliary movement. Magnesium inhibits the supply of available energy, while potassium
  antagonizes magnesium's inhibitory effects. The findings contribute to our understanding
  of cilia biology and cellular energy metabolism.
