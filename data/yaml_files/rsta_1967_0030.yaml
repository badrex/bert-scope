tldr: This article discusses the U.S. Navy's Doppler geodetic system, Tranet, and
  its observational accuracy. The system uses measurements of the Doppler shift in
  radio receptions from Earth satellites for geodetic research. The author describes
  the configuration and general operations of the system, as well as the various sources
  of observational error that contribute to the calculation of position from Doppler
  data. The current observational accuracy of the system is estimated to be around
  10 for data from a single pass of a near Earth satellite.
