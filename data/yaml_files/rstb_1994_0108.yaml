tldr: The article discusses the role of the bcl-2 gene in the development and function
  of lymphocytes and their malignant transformation. Expression of a bcl-2 transgene
  in B lymphoid cells disrupted homeostasis and led to autoimmune diseases, while
  T lymphoid cells showed resistance to cytotoxic agents. The bcl-2 gene promotes
  cell survival and has implications for understanding lymphomagenesis.
