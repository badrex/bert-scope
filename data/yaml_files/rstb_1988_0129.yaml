tldr: This study examines the antibiotic resistance patterns of enteric bacteria in
  wild mammals on the Krakatau Islands and West Java, Indonesia. The researchers found
  significant differences in the faecal flora of rats and bats on the islands, with
  mammals on Java showing higher levels of antibiotic resistance. The study suggests
  that the widespread use of antibiotics by humans on Java may be contributing to
  the increased resistance in the local wildlife.
