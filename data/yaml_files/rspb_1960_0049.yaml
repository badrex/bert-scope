tldr: The study investigates the survival of Bacterium lactis aerogenes when held
  at growth temperature without nutriment. It found that maximum survival occurs at
  a specific cell density, with survival being proportionally less at higher and lower
  densities. The findings suggest that bacterial cells can interact and support each
  other's survival in nutrient-deprived conditions.
