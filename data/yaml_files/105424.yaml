tldr: The author proposes observing the star Sirius to determine its annual parallax,
  which would provide direct proof of the Copernican system. The author examines previous
  observations of Sirius and finds a noticeable difference in its zenith distances
  at different times of the year, suggesting the presence of a parallax. This proposal
  encourages further observations to confirm the existence of a parallax in Sirius.
