tldr: This article discusses effective procedures in field theory, focusing on algorithms
  and the construction of explicit and extension fields. The authors define explicit
  rings and fields and explore the existence of algorithms in these fields. They also
  discuss the classification of extension fields and the concept of explicit isomorphism
  and homomorphism.
