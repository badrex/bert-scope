tldr: The article investigates the effects of injecting inositol 1,3,4,5-tetrakisphosphate
  (Ins(1,3,4,5)P4) into Xenopus oocytes, which generates an oscillatory chloride current
  dependent on intracellular calcium. The results show that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 causes
  the release of calcium from internal stores and activates voltage-sensitive calcium
  channels in the surface membrane. This study contributes to understanding the role
  of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as an intracellular messenger in calcium signaling.
