tldr: The authors investigated the natural sequence variation of the TRAP gene in
  Plasmodium falciparum using DNA analysis and polymerase chain reaction. They found
  the gene to be highly polymorphic, with over 50 amino acid substitutions and a small-variable
  tandemly repeating motif. The TRAP gene is linked to chromosome 13 and exhibits
  no significant linkage to growth parameters in a genetic cross. The study suggests
  that TRAP gene mutations may play a role in allelic variation by the parasite.
