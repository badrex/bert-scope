tldr: The author investigates the effects of porous walls on the lift and moment forces
  acting on an aerofoil in a wind tunnel. They develop a theory that calculates the
  interference caused by porous walls and provide equations for lift and moment forces.
  This study is useful for understanding and improving wind tunnel testing for aerofoil
  design.
