tldr: The authors, Dee and Wilson, measured the mobility of a single actinium recoil
  atom immediately after it reached the end of its recoil track using the cloud method.
  They found that the mobility of the actinium recoil atom in air saturated with water
  vapor is sometimes equal to the mobility of the positive air ion under similar conditions.
  This research is important for understanding the behavior of individual atoms and
  the role of positive air ions in atomic processes.
