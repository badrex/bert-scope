tldr: This article investigates the effects of temperature changes on the elasticities
  and internal viscosity of metal wires. The authors conducted experiments on various
  metals, including German silver, mild steel, brass, copper, and soft iron. They
  found that the Young's modulus and rigidity modulus of the metals decreased with
  increasing temperature. The study also provided interesting insights into the rate
  of decay of torsional oscillations at different temperatures.
