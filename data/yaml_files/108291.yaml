tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to analyze the chemical nature
  of wax, specifically beeswax. They discovered that beeswax contains two main components,
  cerin and myricin, which can be separated using alcohol. The author also found that
  cerin can be further broken down into an unsaponifiable body called cerain and an
  acid. This research sheds light on the formation of fatty bodies and the transformation
  of sugar into wax in bees, which could have implications for understanding animal
  structure repair and the production of other waxes.
