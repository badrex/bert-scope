tldr: The authors conducted research on the minute anatomy of the alimentary canal,
  specifically focusing on connective tissue corpuscles and fat absorption. They discovered
  that connective tissue corpuscles exist among the epithelium and play a role in
  fat absorption. The research also found that the lining endothelium of the lymph
  vessels is in anatomical continuity with the connective tissue stroma, suggesting
  that fat is absorbed through the processes of the connective tissue and then enters
  the lymph vessels.
