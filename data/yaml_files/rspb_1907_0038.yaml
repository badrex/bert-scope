tldr: The author studied the development and metamorphosis of Ophiothrix fragilis,
  a common species of British Ophiuroidea. They discovered two types of development,
  one resulting in a normal larva and the other in an abnormal one. The author also
  found that the condition of the egg at the moment of fertilization has a significant
  impact on the subsequent development and may be the origin of variations. The study
  has important implications for experimental studies using echinoderm eggs.
