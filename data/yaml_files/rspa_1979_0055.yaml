tldr: The article reviews the current status of galactic X-ray sources and presents
  a tentative classification scheme based on the nature of their optical counterparts.
  It discusses high-mass and low-mass binary systems, their properties, and differences
  in X-ray behavior. The article also highlights recent observations of three galactic
  X-ray sources, H1705-25, and SS Cygni, and their implications for understanding
  the nature of these sources.
