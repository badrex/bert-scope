tldr: William Herschel conducted experiments to investigate the heating and illuminating
  powers of different colored rays using a prism. He discovered that the red ray has
  the highest heating power, while the violet has the least. The maximum illumination
  lies in the yellow or pale green. Herschel also found that radiant heat is refrangible
  and suggested that different colored rays may have different chemical properties.
  He proposed using dark-green and smoked glasses to view the sun more safely and
  comfortably through telescopes.
