tldr: This article presents a probabilistic analysis of the tensile strength of hybrid
  fiber composites, considering the breaking strains of different fiber types as statistical
  variables. The authors develop a theoretical model to predict the stress-strain
  relationship of the composite and perform a comprehensive parametric study to understand
  the relationships between composite breaking behavior and fiber and composite interfacial
  properties. The hybrid effects are discussed, revealing various factors causing
  these effects and their impact on composite behavior.
