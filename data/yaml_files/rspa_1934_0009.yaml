tldr: The authors study the corrosion process of metals in aqueous solutions and the
  role of anions in forming complex ions. They investigate the initial velocity of
  the corrosive process and how it is influenced by factors such as electrolytic solution
  pressure, the stability of metal ions, and the coordinating tendency of anions.
  They measure the rate of solution of copper and nickel in various sodium salt solutions
  to test their theory.
