tldr: Ralph Thoresby, in his letter to Dr. Martin Lister, describes the discovery
  of a Roman pottery near Leeds in Yorkshire. He explains the location, the ruins
  of the furnaces, and the surrounding area. Thoresby also discusses the possibility
  of the site being a Roman brickmaking facility due to the abundance of clay in the
  area and the presence of Roman bricks in nearby ruins. He seeks Lister's thoughts
  on the matter and requests information about Roman metalwork from Santon.
