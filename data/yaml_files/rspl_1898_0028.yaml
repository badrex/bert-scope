tldr: The author conducted experiments on cross-fertilization in eight different species
  of echinoids, specifically Strongylocentrotus lividus and Sphaerechinus granularis.
  They found that the hybrid larvae's characteristics depend on the relative degrees
  of maturity of the sexual products. The study also showed variations in the capacity
  for cross-fertilization due to seasonal changes in the maturity of sexual products.
