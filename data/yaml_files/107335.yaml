tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, conducted experiments to determine if sugar
  exists in the blood of people with diabetes mellitus. Using a new method of coagulating
  serum, he found no trace of sugar in the blood samples he examined. This discovery
  challenged the existing understanding of diabetes and led to further research on
  the disease's nature and treatment.
