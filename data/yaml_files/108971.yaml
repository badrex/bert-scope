tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the reaction between hydric peroxide
  and hydric iodide. They developed a method to measure the amount of chemical change
  and observed the time it takes for the reaction to occur. This research helped them
  understand the connection between the conditions of a chemical change and its amount.
