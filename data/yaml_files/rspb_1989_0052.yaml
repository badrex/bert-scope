tldr: The study examines the iron mineralization process in the radula teeth of the
  chiton Acanthopleura hirtosa. It investigates the role of the superior epithelium
  cells in delivering iron to the teeth and the structure and organization of the
  iron biominerals present in the teeth. The research also discusses the surrounding
  non-iron minerals and the dynamic mechanism of iron mineralization in the radula.
