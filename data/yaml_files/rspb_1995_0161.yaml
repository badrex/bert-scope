tldr: This study investigates the role of shape and colour information in recognizing
  the sex and race of faces. The authors used novel technology to separate shape and
  colour data and found that both shape and colour provide useful information for
  categorization decisions. Shape information was particularly useful for race decisions,
  while colour dominated sex decisions. The results have implications for understanding
  face recognition and potential applications in telecommunications.
