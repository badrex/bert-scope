  Soluble Chromatin'

tldr: The article discusses the organization of transcribed regions of chromatin and
  the role of endonuclease DNase II in attacking specific portions of chromosomal
  DNA. The Mg2+ soluble fraction is found to be enriched in sequences coding for cytoplasmic
  poly(A)-containing RNA and globin messenger RNA. The study also presents a procedure
  for chromatin fractionation using DNase II and Mg2+ to separate active and inactive
  chromatin regions.
