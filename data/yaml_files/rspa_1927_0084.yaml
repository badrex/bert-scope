tldr: The authors develop a generalized Sturm-Liouville expansion theory, which involves
  series of pairs of related functions. They explore the properties of these expansions,
  including the behavior of characteristic constants and the distribution of roots.
  This work has applications in various fields of mathematics and physics.
