tldr: The author, William Huggins, conducted further observations on the spectra of
  nebulae and clusters. He discovered that they give either a continuous spectrum
  or a spectrum with one, two, or three bright lines. Huggins also developed a method
  to estimate the intrinsic brightness of some nebulae, finding that they consist
  of luminous gas in masses. This research contributes to the understanding of the
  gaseous nature of these celestial bodies and the possibility of periodic brightness
  variations.
