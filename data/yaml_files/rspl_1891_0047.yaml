tldr: This article discusses the melting points of gold-aluminium alloys and the discovery
  of a true compound in the series. The author, W. C. Roberts-Austen, found that the
  addition of aluminium to gold causes a decrease in the melting point. The purple
  alloy, AuA12, has a higher melting point than gold, making it an infusible substance.
  The gold-aluminium series is of great interest and importance in the field of alloy
  chemistry.
