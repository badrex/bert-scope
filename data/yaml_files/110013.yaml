tldr: This article by Charles Bell discusses the role of specific nerves in the chest
  that are responsible for various actions, including breathing, speaking, and expressing
  emotions. These respiratory nerves are distinct from the common voluntary and sensible
  nerves and the sympathetic system. They are essential for respiration, language,
  and facial expressions, as they enable the chest and face to become organs of expression
  when the heart is affected by emotions.
