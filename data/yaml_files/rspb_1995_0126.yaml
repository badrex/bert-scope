tldr: The study demonstrates that female abdominal spines in water striders function
  to increase female control over copulation. By experimentally extending the phenotypic
  size range of these spines, it was found that this morphological adaptation allows
  females to thwart harassing males and reduce the frequency of costly matings. This
  shows the coevolutionary nature of sexual conflict and highlights that females are
  active participants in the battle for control of reproduction.
