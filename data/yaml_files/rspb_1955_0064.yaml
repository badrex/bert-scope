tldr: The authors studied the H-2 antigenic system in mice, which plays a significant
  role in transplantation immunity. They found that the system is highly polymorphic,
  with multiple antigens and alleles. The study also discussed the challenges in demonstrating
  allelomorphs and the importance of understanding the antigenic system for genetic
  studies and tumor transplantation.
