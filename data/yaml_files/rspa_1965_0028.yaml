tldr: The authors calculated the phonon spectrum of sodium using Bailyn's matrix elements
  for electron-phonon interaction. The results showed satisfactory agreement with
  experimental data from neutron scattering, specific heats, and elastic constants.
  This approach has advantages over previous methods, as it does not require an arbitrary
  parameter.
