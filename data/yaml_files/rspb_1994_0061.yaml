tldr: The study investigates the origin of fin mesenchyme in zebrafish embryos, specifically
  the contribution of trunk neural crest cells. Using a vital cell marking technique,
  the researchers found that only injections into the neural keel site resulted in
  labeled cells in the fin mesenchyme. This provides evidence that trunk neural crest
  contributes to the formation of the fin mesenchyme and exoskeleton in zebrafish.
