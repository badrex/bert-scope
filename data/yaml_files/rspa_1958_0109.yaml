tldr: The authors present a new approach to the problem of the statistical distribution
  of the intervals between successive zeros of a random, Gaussian function. They derive
  a sequence of approximations to the desired probability density and discuss the
  properties of these approximations. The analysis also gives rise to an alternative
  approximation that is less accurate for small values of the interval but more accurate
  for larger values. Numerical computation of the approximations is carried out for
  a low-pass spectrum, and the results are compared with experimental data, showing
  encouraging agreement.
