tldr: The author, Thomas Hopkins, explains that aqueous vapor is the main factor in
  disturbing atmospheric pressure. As the vapor ascends and cools, it condenses, releasing
  heat and causing the gases to expand and create an ascending current. This process
  leads to cloud formation, changes in barometric pressure, and various weather phenomena,
  including rain and winds. Hopkins argues that this theory applies to all latitudes
  and can help explain meteorological phenomena like trade winds and sea breezes.
