tldr: The authors investigate the effects of temperature variations on the apparent
  thermionic constants of oxygenated tungsten. They demonstrate that temperature coefficients
  of adsorption and chemical reactions can mask the electronic properties of the material,
  leading to anomalous values for the work function and emission constant. The study
  provides a new interpretation of Richardson plots for composite surfaces and highlights
  the importance of considering temperature variations in surface equilibrium when
  analyzing thermionic properties.
