revised_title: Earth's Expansion and Continental Displacement During Mesozoic and
  Cenozoic
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences > Plate Tectonics
semantic_tags:
- Plate tectonics
- Earth's expansion
- Continental drift
- Ocean floor spreading
- Paleogeography
tldr: The authors argue that the Earth has expanded by 20% of its current diameter
  during the last 180-200 million years, leading to better fits of continental fragments
  and more accurate representation of the Earth's surface. This expansion is supported
  by ocean floor spreading data and has significant implications for the distribution
  of marine life and the understanding of the Earth's history.
