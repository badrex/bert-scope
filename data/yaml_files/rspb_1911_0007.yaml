tldr: This article discusses the examination of the central nervous system in a cured
  case of human trypanosomiasis. The patient received treatment with inorganic arsenic
  and later contracted syphilis, which was treated with mercury. The author found
  no traces of the characteristic meningeal and perivascular infiltration or gliosis
  in the brain during the histological examination. The case emphasizes the importance
  of early diagnosis and energetic treatment of the infection.
