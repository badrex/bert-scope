tldr: The authors present an exact solution to the two-dimensional elasticity problem
  with rectangular boundaries under arbitrary edge forces. They use a series solution
  approach and express the loading as a Fourier series. The solution is applicable
  to various stress problems and provides insights into the behavior of stresses and
  displacements in rectangular structures.
