tldr: The author explains the concept of equipotential curves and surfaces, and how
  to determine their forms using a battery, electrodes, and a galvanometer. They describe
  the process of tracing these curves on a sheet of tinfoil and discuss the mathematical
  properties of these curves, which can be used to understand the flow of electric
  current and potential differences in various materials.
