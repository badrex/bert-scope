tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the physico-chemical theory of
  fermentation and the conditions that favor archebiosis in previously boiled fluids.
  They discovered that neutral or slightly alkaline organic fluids are more prone
  to undergo fermentation than slightly acidic fluids. The author also found that
  heat and oxygen play a significant role in promoting fermentation, and that adding
  liquor potassae to boiled urine increases its fermentability. These findings contribute
  to the ongoing discussion about the origin of fermentations and the role of living
  organisms or germs in the process.
