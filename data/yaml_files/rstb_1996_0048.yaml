tldr: This article reviews the principles of protein-DNA recognition in transcription
  factors, focusing on the diverse protein architectures and the importance of shape
  and chemical recognition in specific interactions. The authors discuss the thermodynamics
  and kinetics of protein-DNA binding, emphasizing the role of DNA structure and flexibility
  in the recognition process. They also explore strategies used by transcription factors
  to increase specificity, such as dimerization and the use of multiple DNA-binding
  domains.
