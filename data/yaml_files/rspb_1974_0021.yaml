tldr: The authors studied the development of the retinotectal projection in Xenopus
  laevis larvae using electrophysiological mapping. They found that the visual map
  on the tectum of tadpoles differs from that in adults, with a progressive shift
  of the retinotectal projection during development. This research provides insights
  into the formation of nerve connections in the visual system of amphibians.
