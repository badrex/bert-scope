tldr: The study investigates the cuticular interference reflectors in the golden pupae
  of danaine butterflies. The reflecting cuticle, which comprises about 80% of the
  body surface, has mirror-like quality. The researchers found that the metallic reflection
  colors can be attributed to constructive interference of light at the layers of
  the cuticle, with no pigments involved. The color changes during pupal development
  can be explained by the formation or decomposition of these layers.
