tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the motion of slow positive ions
  in gases, focusing on potassium and nitrogen ions in nitrogen. The authors describe
  the design and operation of their apparatus, which combines a time-of-drift electrode
  system and a lateral diffusion system. They measure the drift velocity of ions and
  discuss the limitations of their method. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of ion mobility and gas physics.
