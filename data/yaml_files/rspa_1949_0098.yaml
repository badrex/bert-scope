tldr: This study investigates the vapour pressures and rates of evaporation of straight-chain
  paraffin hydrocarbons. The researchers determined the physical constants, such as
  refractive index, density, and latent heats of vaporization and fusion, for these
  hydrocarbons. They used the Knudsen method to measure the vapour pressures and found
  that the rates of evaporation of drops and solid beads agreed with the previously
  published theory. The results provide insights into the size and shape of hydrocarbon
  molecules and have implications for further studies on branched-chain paraffin hydrocarbons
  and hydrocarbon mixtures.
