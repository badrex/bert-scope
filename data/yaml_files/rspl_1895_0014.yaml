tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature and chemical composition
  on the rate of chemical reactions, specifically focusing on hydrogen dioxide, hydrogen
  iodide, and sodium hydrogen carbonate. The authors found that the rate of chemical
  change varies with the amount and type of substances in the reaction medium and
  the temperature. They also discovered that at absolute zero, no chemical change
  can take place.
