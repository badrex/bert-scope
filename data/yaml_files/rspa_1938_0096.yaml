tldr: The authors investigated the diamagnetism and crystal structure of cadmium using
  single crystals prepared by the Bridgman method. They determined the principal susceptibilities
  and the influence of cold-working and foreign matter on the diamagnetism of cadmium.
  The results provide insights into the properties of the crystalline state and the
  effects of external factors on the metal's magnetic behavior.
