tldr: The article explores the behavior of X-ray diffraction from imperfect crystals
  using the Takagi-Taupin equations. It investigates the effects of extinction and
  the asymmetric limits on the diffraction properties of bent and mosaic crystals.
  The results confirm that the asymmetric limits are universal extinction-free limits,
  providing valuable insights into the functional dependence of extinction on the
  path through the crystal and the accuracy of available extinction theories.
