tldr: Richard Phillips investigates Dr. Prout and Dr. Thomson's theory that all atomic
  weights are simple multiples of hydrogen's atomic weight. He conducts a series of
  experiments using silver as a basis to determine the equivalent numbers of chlorine
  and other elementary gases. Phillips concludes that the theory holds true with minimal
  error for hydrogen, oxygen, azote, and chlorine.
