tldr: The author, Marshall Hall, discusses the function of the medulla oblongata and
  medulla spinalis, and introduces the concept of the excito-motory system of nerves.
  He explains that the spinal cord and excito-motory nerves are responsible for reflex
  actions, and that these nerves can be influenced by mechanical or galvanic stimuli.
  Hall also reviews the work of other physiologists and applies his theory to various
  physiological and pathological phenomena, including muscle movements, eyelid motions,
  and actions resulting from the passions.
