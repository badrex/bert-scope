tldr: This article investigates the occurrence of chemical reactions in supersonic
  expansions of gases into a vacuum, focusing on the implications for mass spectrometric
  sampling. The authors analyze the extent of hydration of ions in a flame and compare
  their findings with experimental determinations, providing insights into the potential
  falsification of measurements of chemical composition during sampling. The study
  has wider relevance and application to various gas-phase systems.
