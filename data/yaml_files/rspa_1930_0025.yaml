tldr: The author, E. V. Appleton, investigates the characteristics of downcoming wireless
  waves by using a frequency-change method. They study the diurnal variation of the
  equivalent height of the ionised layer in the atmosphere responsible for deviating
  wireless waves. The research focuses on the pre-sunrise phenomena and the significance
  of multiple downcoming rays, which led to further investigations in simultaneous
  reception of downcoming waves at several receiving stations and the use of shorter
  wavelengths.
