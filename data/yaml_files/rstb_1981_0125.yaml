semantic_tags:

- Chemical weed control
tldr: The article discusses the inefficiencies of current weed control methods and
  proposes the use of growth-regulating chemicals to manipulate weed behavior for
  more effective control. It suggests targeting seed dormancy and vegetative regeneration
  as potential areas of development in weed control. The author also considers other
  aspects of weed behavior that could be manipulated for control purposes.
