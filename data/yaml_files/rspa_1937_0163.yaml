tldr: The authors developed a method for quantitative spectrographic analysis of fresh
  plant tissue without ashing or chemical treatment. They applied this method to determine
  boron content, using a photometer designed to measure line intensities accurately.
  This technique has general applicability for analyzing various biological materials.
