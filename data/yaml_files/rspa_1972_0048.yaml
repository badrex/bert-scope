tldr: The article presents an experimental study of ionization of positive ions by
  electrons using the merging beams technique. The authors investigate the relative
  cross-sections for ionization as a function of the laboratory energy of the electrons
  and obtain consistent results with published values. They also discuss the apparatus
  and experimental procedure, including the electron gun, interaction region, and
  data acquisition methods.
