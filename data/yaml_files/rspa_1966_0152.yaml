tldr: This article presents experimental and theoretical investigations of the speed-dependent
  sag and the first and second-order vibration of a flexible, axially asymmetric rotor.
  The authors designed a measuring device to directly measure the variations in the
  rotor's deflection and vibration, providing valuable information for understanding
  and improving the dynamic behavior of rotating shafts in industrial applications.
