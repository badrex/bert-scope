tldr: This study examines the deformation mechanisms in metals, such as mild steel,
  duralumin, and silver alloys, under high-impact velocities. The researchers found
  that different materials respond to impact in various ways, with deformation occurring
  through the formation of compression bands, cracks, or plastic deformation. The
  results provide insights into the mechanisms of deformation under high-velocity
  impacts and help understand the behavior of metals during collisions.
