tldr: The author develops a statistical mechanics approach for inhomogeneous systems,
  using a one-body potential and a generalized grand potential. They obtain virial
  expansions for density, pressure tensor, and isosteric heat of absorption, and apply
  the theory to a model system of gaussian molecules and zeolite pores.
