tldr: The author investigates the effect of external medium on the internal pH of
  muscle and concludes that muscles maintain their internal pH by active metabolic
  effort. The Donnan equilibrium does not control the distribution of hydrogen ions
  across the muscle fiber membrane. The study shows that when the controlling mechanism
  fails, the contractile function of the muscle deteriorates.
