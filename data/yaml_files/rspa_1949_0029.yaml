tldr: The authors develop a theory for two-dimensional fluid motion referred to a
  network of orthogonal curves. They express the geodesic or surface curvatures of
  these curves in terms of the coordinates and their derivatives. The theory is applied
  to aerodynamics and dynamical meteorology, providing equations of motion and continuity
  for these fields.
