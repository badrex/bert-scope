tldr: The author studies the development history of the Mollusca, focusing on the
  freshwater bivalve Pisidium pusillum. They describe the various stages of embryonic
  development, including the formation of the Gastrula, the origin of the mesoblast,
  and the role of the epiblast and hypoblast in the growth of the organism. This research
  contributes to the understanding of mollusk development and the similarities between
