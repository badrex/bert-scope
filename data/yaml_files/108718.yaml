tldr: The author examines the bones of the hind limbs of the Megatherium, a large
  extinct sloth, and describes the structure and function of the ilium, ischium, and
  pubis bones. They also discuss the pelvis, acetabulum, and femur, comparing the
  Megatherium's anatomy to that of other mammals, such as elephants and rhinoceroses.
  The study provides insights into the size, strength, and unique features of the
  Megatherium's skeletal structure.
