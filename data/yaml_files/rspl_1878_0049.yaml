tldr: The author, Charles Tomlinson, conducted experiments to study the effect of
  ozone on nuclei and the activation of inactive oils. He found that ozone could make
  inactive oils active when mixed with them. The author also discovered that the activity
  of charcoal does not depend on absorption but on the condition of the air contained
  within its pores.
