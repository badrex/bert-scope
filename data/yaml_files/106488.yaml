tldr: The black canker caterpillar, an invasive species, was destroying turnip crops
  in Norfolk, causing significant losses to farmers. The caterpillars were observed
  to arrive in large numbers from the sea coast, suggesting they were not native to
  the area. The author provides a detailed description of the caterpillar's life cycle
  and suggests that the female deposits her eggs in the edge of the turnip leaf using
  specialized instruments. Efforts to control and prevent the damage caused by this
  pest are discussed.
