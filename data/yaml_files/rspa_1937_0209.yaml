tldr: This study investigates the critical shear stress of mercury single crystals
  and examines the stress-strain curves to understand the effect of impurity content
  on the critical shear stress. The experiments reveal the existence of preliminary
  "sets" before true plastic yield and various forms of slip bands, providing insights
  into the mechanism of glide in crystals.
