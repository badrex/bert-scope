tldr: The authors conducted rocket-borne photometry in the ultraviolet region to study
  the Orion star. They used two calibrated photometers and recorded three channels
  with overlapping wavelength regions. Preliminary evaluation of the data shows fair
  agreement with previous measurements for wavelengths longer than 2000 A, with differences
  in shorter wavelengths. The results indicate an effective temperature of around
  25,000 K.
