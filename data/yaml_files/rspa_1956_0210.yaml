tldr: This study investigates the cool flames produced during the combustion of toluene
  and ethylbenzene. The authors observed cool flames in the oxidation of both hydrocarbons,
  with ethylbenzene producing a blue flame at higher temperatures. The results show
  that the processes allowing cool-flame formation in aromatic compounds are secondary
  in nature, and the oxidation mechanisms differ from those of paraffin hydrocarbons.
  The authors conclude that a change in reaction mechanism occurs above 300Â°C in ethylbenzene
  oxidation, possibly due to the breakdown of unstable oxygenated intermediates.
