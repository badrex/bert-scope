tldr: The authors studied the chemical reactions occurring in the sulphur dioxide
  afterglow and found that the main recombination reactions are (1) and (2), with
  rate constants of and at for Ar. Reaction (2) is the dominant process removing sulphur
  monoxide (SO), which is otherwise unreactive. The absolute intensity of the sulphur
  dioxide afterglow is found to be [SO] for argon carriers at pressures between and
  mmHg. The afterglow emission comes from three excited states of SO, which are populated
  subsequent to or by the third-order combination reaction (2). Excited SO is mainly
  removed by electronic quenching.
