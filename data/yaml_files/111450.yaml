tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the thermo-electric constants
  of various metals and their positions in the thermo-electric series. The results
  were obtained using a unique method involving thermo-elements, a multiplicator,
  and a magnet. The study aimed to understand the relationship between the nature
  of metals and their thermo-electric properties.
