- Infection establishment
tldr: The study examines the different ways Leishmania attaches itself to the gut
  lining of sandflies, specifically Lutzomyia longipalpis, which is crucial for the
  successful establishment of infection and transmission by bite. The research describes
  the transformation of amastigotes to promastigotes and their attachment to the mid-gut
  and oesophageal valve of the sandfly, providing insights into the life-cycle of
  the parasite and its transmission.
