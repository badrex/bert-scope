tldr: The authors conducted experiments with alternating currents and found that they
  can stimulate chemical reactions in certain cells, increasing their output of current.
  This effect was observed in various types of cells and batteries, and it was found
  that alternating currents can make some metals soluble in electrolytes. The authors
  also discussed the potential applications of this phenomenon in electrochemical
  processes and the functioning of the Branley filings coherer.
