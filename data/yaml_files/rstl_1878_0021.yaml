tldr: The author conducted a detailed osteological study of the Polyodon folium, a
  type of ganoid fish. They provided a comprehensive description of the skull's structure,
  comparing it to other fish, amphibians, and its closest living relative, the sturgeon.
  The study aimed to understand the fish's evolutionary relationships with other species
  and the implications for its classification within the Ganoids and Amphibia groups.
