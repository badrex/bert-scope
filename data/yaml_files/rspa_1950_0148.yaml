tldr: The authors used radio data to derive a model solar chromosphere. They developed
  an empirical relationship between the equivalent black-body temperature and radio
  frequency, allowing them to determine the absorption coefficient of radio waves
  in the solar atmosphere. By separating the coronal and chromospheric components
  of radiation, they determined their distributions over the solar disk. The results
  were compared with experimental observations, showing good agreement for the present
  purposes. This model provided a relationship between electron temperature and optical
  depth, which helped determine electron densities and temperatures throughout the
  chromosphere.
