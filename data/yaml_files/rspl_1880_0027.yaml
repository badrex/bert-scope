tldr: This article examines the minute structure and function of the thyroid gland
  in various animals, including the dog, cat, horse, rabbit, and more. The author
  discovers that the thyroid gland contains vesicles that store a colloid substance
  and that red blood cells can enter these vesicles, contributing to the formation
  of the colloid substance. The thyroid gland also contains a network of lymphatics
  and blood vessels, and the author discusses the role of these structures in the
  gland's function.
