tldr: This article describes the discovery of a rare species of worm shells on an
  island off the northwest coast of Sumatra after a violent earthquake in 1797. The
  shells were found protruding from the mud and were of various shapes and sizes.
  The author, J. Griffiths, initially thought they were a new genus but later found
  similar shells described by Rumphius. The shells' unique features include their
  great length, size, and division in the upper part.
