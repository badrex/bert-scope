tldr: This article investigates the physical nature of striae in stratified discharges.
  The authors study the effect of external discharges on the internal discharge and
  observe that the striae can cast shadows in the radiant showers coming from the
  inside of the tube. The experiments provide insights into the nature of the striae
  and the relationship between the internal and external discharges.
