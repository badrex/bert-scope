  Flow Field Information'

tldr: This article explores the similarities between the visual orientation systems
  of insects and humans, specifically focusing on the fly Drosophila melanogaster.
  The study demonstrates that, like humans, flies can adapt to and manipulate visual
  flow field information for motor output systems not specifically designed for this
  type of sensory data. The findings suggest that the kind of visuo-motor coordination
  in insects may be universal in the animal kingdom.
