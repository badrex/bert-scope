revised_title: Ultra-sensitive Laser Interferometers and Their Application to Earth's
  Strain Measurement

tldr: The authors developed a 30-meter laser strainmeter to measure Earth's strain
  and studied its application in detecting Earth tides and normal modes. The instrument's
  sensitivity is comparable to longer instruments, and it has the potential to improve
  our understanding of Earth's internal structure and dynamics.
