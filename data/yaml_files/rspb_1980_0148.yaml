tldr: The author discusses the complex proteases of the complement system and their
  role in the immune response. The complement system is activated through two pathways,
  classical and alternative, and involves the binding of complement components to
  aggregates or surfaces. The author focuses on the assembly and activation of the
  early components of the classical pathway, highlighting the proteases Cl, C3 convertase,
  and C5 convertase, and their functions in the immune defense against foreign substances.
