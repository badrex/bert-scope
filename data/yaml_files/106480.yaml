tldr: Mr. Ramsden describes a new construction of eye-glasses for telescopes applied
  to mathematical instruments. The design corrects errors caused by the spherical
  figure of the lenses and the different refrangibility of light. This improvement
  allows for better precision in measurements and a larger angle of vision. The new
  eye-glass system can also be easily adjusted for different magnifying powers and
  is suitable for various applications.
