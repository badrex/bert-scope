tldr: Jagadis Chunder Bose investigated the contact sensitiveness of chemical elements
  to electric radiation. He discovered that nearly half of the elements exhibit an
  increase in resistance due to radiation. The sensitiveness depends on the chemical
  substance and is a periodic function of its atomic weight. Radiation causes a molecular
  change or allotropic modification in the substance, affecting its sensitivity. Fatigue
  in the system is due to the presence of radiation products.
