tldr: This article discusses how viruses can overcome non-specific defenses in the
  host, such as fever and macrophages, to increase their pathogenicity. It also explores
  the role of interferon as a mediator of non-specific defense mechanisms and the
  interaction of viruses with Kupffer cells in the liver. The study highlights the
  importance of thermoresistance and its correlation with virulence in various viruses.
