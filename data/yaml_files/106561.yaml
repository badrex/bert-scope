tldr: This article outlines the guidelines for selecting papers to be published in
  the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London. The responsibility
  falls on the Council Members, who form a standing committee to review and decide
  which papers should be published. They meet regularly to discuss and vote on papers,
  with the majority's decision being final. The article also mentions the involvement
  of experts in specific fields when needed.
