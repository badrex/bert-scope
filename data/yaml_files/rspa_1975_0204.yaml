tldr: This article compares experimental results with Hamaker coefficients calculated
  from Lifshitz theory in oil-water systems, specifically studying thin lipid films.
  The authors find that treating the hydrocarbon layer of the lipid film as a layered
  structure improves the accuracy of theoretical calculations, demonstrating the importance
  of considering the dielectric properties of the film components. The results show
  that small differences in dielectric properties can significantly affect van der
  Waals forces in thin films.
