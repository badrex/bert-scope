tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, presents new tables of symmetric functions up to
  the tenth degree of the roots of an equation of any order. He also provides a set
  of tables giving expressions of powers and products of coefficients in terms of
  symmetric functions of the roots. Additionally, Cayley discusses a symmetry in the
  tables and a theorem in the subject, which has not been observed before.
