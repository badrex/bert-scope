tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the initial stages of photosynthesis,
  specifically the formation of primary photolytic products from carbon dioxide and
  the evolution of oxygen. They found that aqueous carbon dioxide can be decomposed
  by light, producing hydrogen peroxide and formaldehyde. These findings support the
  belief that both formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide are formed in green leaves during
  photosynthesis.
