tldr: The author investigated the minimum potential difference required to produce
  sparks in various gases between large parallel plates at different pressures. The
  results showed that the striking potential decreased with decreasing pressure until
  a certain point, after which it rapidly increased. The study provided experimental
  evidence supporting the views on the behavior of the negative glow and positive
  column in gas discharges.
