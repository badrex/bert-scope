tldr: The author analyzes the rotation of the Sun using five-minute oscillations observed
  by Duvall and Harvey. They develop an asymptotic method to estimate the Sun's angular
  velocity near the equatorial plane, providing insights into the Sun's rotation and
  its deep interior. This study helps to understand the Sun's evolution and its impact
  on the solar system.
