tldr: The authors develop a molecular orbital description of ligand field spectra
  and test it by carrying out least-squares fits of the spectra of tetrahedral ions.
  They calculate general expressions for electron repulsion matrix elements and molecular
  spin-orbit coupling matrix elements within a molecular orbital basis. The model
  is tested against experimental data, providing a better understanding of ligand
  field excited states in transition metal complexes.
