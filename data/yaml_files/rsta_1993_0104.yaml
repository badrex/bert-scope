tldr: The article presents a reaction model for the epitaxial growth of III-V semiconductors
  using chemical beam epitaxy. The model considers physical effects like site-blocking,
  lateral interactions, and the role of adsorbed arsenic in inhibiting growth. Computer
  simulations based on the model show good agreement with experimental observations
  and provide a better understanding of the growth kinetics of GaAs. This research
  contributes to the development of advanced semiconductor materials and technologies.
