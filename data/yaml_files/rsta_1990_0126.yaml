revised_title: Coastal Flood Risk Assessment and Climate Change Impacts
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Geology and Oceanography
semantic_tags:
- Coastal flood prevention
- Climate change
- Sea level analysis
- Spatial modeling
- Extreme event risk assessment
tldr: The authors develop a spatial model to analyze the marginal behavior and inter-site
  dependence of sea level annual maxima around the British coast, helping to assess
  the risk of coastal flooding and understand the potential impacts of climate change
  on extreme sea levels.
