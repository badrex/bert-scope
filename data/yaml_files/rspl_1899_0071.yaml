tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the electrical resistivity of
  electrolytic nickel at various temperatures. They found that the resistivity of
  electrolytic nickel at 0°C is 6935 C.G.S. units, and the average temperature coefficient
  between 0°C and 100°C is 0.00618. The results indicate that electrolytic nickel
  has a significantly lower resistivity than the nickel used in previous experiments.
  The author suggests investigating the physical differences between the two types
  of nickel.
