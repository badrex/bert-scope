tldr: This article explores the possibility of thermal equilibrium between a black
  hole and a heat bath, following Hawking's discovery of black hole emission. The
  authors introduce thermal Green functions to discuss this equilibrium and extend
  the original arguments to include mutual and self-interactions. They also discuss
  the effect of gravity on the system and the relation between energy, entropy, and
  temperature in the presence of a black hole.
