tldr: The study examines the five-stage behavior pattern of the sea anemone Calliactis
  parasitica when transferring to shells of the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus. The
  clinging response of the anemone to shells is found to depend on a general molluscan
  shell-factor, and the anemone establishes the association without the crab's assistance.
  The research provides insights into the factors involved in the anemone's response
  to a shell and the movements required for successful settlement.
