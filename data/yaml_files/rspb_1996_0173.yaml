tldr: Male zebra finches preferentially pair with females that have a higher potential
  for fecundity due to previous exposure to a high-quality diet. This preference is
  demonstrated through dietary manipulation experiments, showing that females with
  larger clutch sizes are more likely to secure a mate. This study provides the first
  evidence linking a female's fecundity to her likelihood of obtaining a mate, highlighting
  the importance of reproductive potential in mate selection for monogamous species.
