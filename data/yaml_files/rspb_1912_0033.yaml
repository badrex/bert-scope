tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the survival rate of non-sporing
  bacteria when dried in a vacuum using charcoal and liquid air. They found that bacteria
  dried in this manner could survive longer than those dried in the air, and that
  sunlight and heat had a limited impact on the dried bacteria. This research has
  implications for understanding the potential presence of bacteria in interplanetary
  space.
