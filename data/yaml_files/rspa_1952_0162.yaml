tldr: The authors propose a theoretical approach to understand ion exchange in cation
  exchangers by treating the exchanger phase as a concentrated aqueous electrolyte.
  They investigate the water uptake in polystyrene sulphonates of varying degrees
  of cross-linking and find that the anions do not contribute to the statistical entropy
  terms of the solutions. The osmotic coefficients of monovalent cations have similar
  trends as in the case of strong 1:1 electrolytes. The authors provide an approximate
  calculation of the distribution constants of the exchangers when in contact with
  solutions containing two cations.
