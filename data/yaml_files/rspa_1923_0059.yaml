tldr: This article investigates the structure of helium's band spectrum, focusing
  on seven specific bands. The study reveals that all bands have a similar structure,
  consisting of three series. However, the third series does not align with the quantum
  theory's predictions. The findings provide insights into the nature of band heads
  and the behavior of helium's spectrum, contributing to the understanding of atomic
  physics.
