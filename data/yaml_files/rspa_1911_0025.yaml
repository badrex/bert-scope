tldr: This article investigates the properties and production of soft Röntgen radiation
  by directing slow cathode rays of known velocity onto various metallic anticathodes.
  The authors measure the energy, absorption coefficients, and corpuscular emission
  of the rays, providing insights into their properties and how they interact with
  different materials.
