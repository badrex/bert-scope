  Sea Bed Study'

tldr: This article explores the impact of infaunal macrobenthos on diagenetic reactions
  and sediment-water exchange in hemipelagic and nearshore regions. It focuses on
  the bioturbation and manganese cycling in deep-sea bed sediments, particularly in
  the eastern equatorial Pacific. The author highlights how macrobenthos interact
  with manganese cycling during early diagenesis and how organic matter decomposition
  reaction balances and rates are affected by particle reworking and burrow irrigation
  in hemipelagic sediments.
