tldr: The author, Arthur Cayley, presents a new approach to the analytical theory
  of the conic and the decomposition of quadric functions. He introduces a formula
  for transforming a given quadric function into a decomposable form, which is the
  basis for solving various geometrical questions involving conic sections. The author
  also demonstrates how this formula simplifies in specific cases, such as when tangents
  are drawn to a conic from a point with double contact.
