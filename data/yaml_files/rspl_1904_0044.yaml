tldr: The author conducted experiments on the compressibility of solid metals, including
  platinum, copper, aluminium, and magnesium, using a unique glass instrument. The
  research determined the absolute linear compressibilities of these metals at various
  pressures and temperatures, providing valuable insights into their material properties.
