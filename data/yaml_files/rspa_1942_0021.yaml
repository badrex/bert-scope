tldr: The authors propose a general structure for condensed monomolecular films, suggesting
  that in the least compressible region, long chains are vertically orientated and
  close-packed, while in the more compressible region, both hydrocarbon chain packing
  and head-group dipole orientation determine the configuration. They discuss the
  physical states of monolayers and the factors influencing them, such as forces between
  polar head groups and hydrophobic tails.
