tldr: The author studied the feeding and digestion organs in the septibranchs, Cuspidaria
  and Poromya, to understand their unique anatomy and function. They found that these
  mollusks have a muscular septum instead of gills, small labial palps, and a thick
  muscular coating in their gut. Their feeding and digestive organs are distinct from
  other Lamellibranchs, and their carnivorous diet is supported by their specialized
  gut structure and digestive processes.
