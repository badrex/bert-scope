tldr: The authors discovered a small, non-quantal endplate potential that arises from
  the rapid synaptic transfer of potassium ions released by the motor nerve impulse.
  This potential is not mediated by acetylcholine and can be observed when the endplate
  region is hyperpolarized. The findings indicate that this non-cholinergic endplate
  potential is due to potassium ions leaving the active nerve terminals and entering
  the muscle fiber through 'anomalous rectifier' channels in the endplate membrane.
