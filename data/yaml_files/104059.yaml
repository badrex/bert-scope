tldr: The author, Sir Conrad Sprengell, discusses the Plica Polonica, a condition
  commonly believed to be a disease affecting people in Poland. He argues that it
  is not a real disease but rather a result of poor hygiene and cultural practices.
  The author also mentions the connection between the Plica Polonica and the myth
  of Medusa, suggesting that the twisted locks of hair might have inspired ancient
  stories of snakes growing on the head.
