tldr: This article presents a rigorous theory of Brownian particle flow and dispersion
  in spatially periodic structures, expanding upon previous work to include convective
  and diffusive transport within the interior of the discontinuous phase, surface
  adsorption, and transport along the phase boundary. Applications to chromatographic
  separation phenomena, heat-transfer problems, and situations involving homogeneous,
  first-order chemical reactions are discussed. The analysis is applicable to various
  fields, including deep-bed filtration, hydrosol deposition in packed beds, transport
  in emulsions, and sedimentation of particles through porous media.
