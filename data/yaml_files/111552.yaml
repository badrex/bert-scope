tldr: The author investigated the properties of ice formed from sea water and found
  that it remains salty even after freezing. The ice forms a unique structure with
  saline crystals on the surface, and the salt content varies depending on the freezing
  temperature. Efflorescence plays a role in breaking up ice floes. The author also
  explored the possibility of obtaining fresh water from sea ice through various freezing
  and melting processes but was unsuccessful.
