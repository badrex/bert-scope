tldr: This study investigates the motion of granular avalanches in curved chutes,
  focusing on the effects of a convex curved 'bump'. The authors conducted experiments
  with different granular materials and compared the results with theoretical predictions.
  They found excellent agreement between the two, demonstrating the effectiveness
  of the theoretical model in predicting the behavior of granular avalanches in complex
  chute geometries.
