tldr: The author, William Thomson, investigates the theory of electric telegraphs
  and the equations governing the flow of electricity through telegraph wires. He
  explains how to calculate the dimensions of telegraph wires and cables required
  for long distances and discusses the time it takes for signals to travel through
  these wires. He also considers the effects of imperfect insulation and the potential
  applications of his findings in submarine telegraphy.
