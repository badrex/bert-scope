tldr: The authors investigated the electron properties of tellurium and found that
  its electrical conductivity increases with the addition of small amounts of foreign
  metals. They also discovered that the increase in conductivity is not proportional
  to the specific conductivity of the added metal. This study provides insights into
  the behavior of tellurium and its potential applications in semiconductors and thermoelectric
  materials.
