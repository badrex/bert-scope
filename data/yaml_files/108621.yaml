tldr: This article presents a new theory on the structure and motion of glaciers.
  The authors argue that the movement of glaciers is not due to their semifluidity,
  but rather to the regelation process, where ice pieces are cemented together when
  pressed. They provide experiments and observations to support their theory, which
  challenges the existing notion of glaciers as ice rivers.
