tldr: The author explores the mathematical properties of pedal surfaces, which are
  the loci of feet of perpendiculars drawn from a point in space to the tangent planes
  of a given primitive surface. The article establishes relationships between the
  volumes of pedal surfaces and their origins, and demonstrates that the origins of
  pedals of equal volume always lie on a surface of the third order. The author also
  compares the properties of pedal curves and pedal surfaces, and provides examples
  to illustrate the concepts.
