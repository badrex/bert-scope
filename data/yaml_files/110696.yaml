tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the electro-chemical equivalents
  of sodium and potassium. They used a solution of dichloride of copper in muriatic
  acid and found that the equivalent of copper was approximately double its atomic
  weight. This research was communicated by Michael Faraday and was based on numerous
  observations made at the P. Louis Observatory in Mauritius.
