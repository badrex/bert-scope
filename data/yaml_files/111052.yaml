tldr: The author, William Sykes Ward, observed that the magnetic force's intensity
  affects the nature and direction of its action on metals. He found that when the
  magnetic force is strong, metals become less sensitive to attraction or repulsion,
  and when weak, they point axially. Ward also discovered that the phenomenon of revulsion,
  described by Faraday, is exhibited in most metals that are less magnetic than platinum
  or less dia-magnetic than antimony. He conducted experiments to determine the order
  in which metals are affected magnetically or dia-magnetically and observed phenomena
  when the polar terminations of the magnet are close together.
