tldr: The author investigates periodic orbits of the second genus in the three-body
  problem, focusing on the equilibrium points and the motion of bodies under the attraction
  of finite spheres. They analyze the equations of motion and transformations to find
  periodic solutions, providing insights into the behavior of celestial bodies in
  the three-body system.
