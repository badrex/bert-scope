tldr: This article discusses the various risks encountered in everyday living and
  travel in urbanized industrial societies. It analyzes the nature, magnitude, and
  frequency of different risks for different age groups and in relation to environmental
  and other factors. The author assesses the contribution of voluntary actions, such
  as alcohol and smoking, and evaluates the extent to which actual and perceived risk
  can be modified through education, engineering, and regulation.
