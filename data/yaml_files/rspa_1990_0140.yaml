tldr: The author rederives Marinov's symplectically invariant variational principle
  and generating functions, emphasizing their geometric aspects. They introduce new
  generating functions that are regular at the caustics of Marinov's functions and
  are suitable for describing canonical transformations close to reflections. These
  new functions have connections to the 'old' generating functions and rules for composing
  generating functions for a pair of canonical transformations.
