tldr: This study investigates the foveal light adaptation process and its effect on
  color perception. The researchers found that the green recovery curves were linear,
  while the red recovery curves were non-linear. This discovery highlights the importance
  of understanding how the human eye adapts to different light conditions to improve
  color perception.
