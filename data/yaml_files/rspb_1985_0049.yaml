tldr: The authors discovered that chlorophyll fluorescence quenching in anaerobic
  chloroplasts is a photosystem II effect. They found that inhibitors blocking electron
  flow between photosystems II and I increase fluorescence and prevent quenching.
  The study suggests that a main part of anaerobic fluorescence quenching is caused
  by the accumulation of reduced phaeophytin, which is prevented by electron transport
  inhibitors acting between photosystem II and I.
