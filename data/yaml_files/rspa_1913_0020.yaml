tldr: The authors conducted a spectro-photometric comparison of the emissivity of
  solid, liquid copper, and liquid silver at high temperatures. They used a "black
  body" apparatus to measure the radiation emitted by the metals and found that the
  emissivity of copper and silver differs significantly from that of a full radiator.
  The emissivity of solid and liquid copper was measured and compared, revealing a
  discontinuity at the melting point.
