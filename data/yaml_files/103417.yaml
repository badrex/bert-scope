tldr: This article discusses the variations in the magnetic compass observed by Captain
  Rogers during his voyage from California to Guam in the Pacific Ocean. The author
  provides a table of the compass variations and makes inferences about the patterns
  of magnetic variation in the region. The findings could help in understanding the
  navigational challenges faced during sea voyages and contribute to the study of
  geomagnetism.
