tldr: This article discusses the principles of circular dichroism, a phenomenon where
  certain molecules absorb left and right circularly polarized light differently.
  It explores the electronic and structural aspects of circular dichroism and its
  applications in determining the absolute configuration of optical isomers and understanding
  the electronic spectra of complex molecules.
