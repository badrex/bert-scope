tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure of rennin using X-ray diffraction
  and explored the effects of various factors on heavy atom uptake. They found that
  crosslinking the crystals with glutaraldehyde improved their robustness and allowed
  for more experiments to influence heavy atom uptake. Despite these efforts, the
  authors were unable to find a simple heavy atom adduct that would provide a clear
  solution for the protein structure. The study raises questions about the relationship
  between protein size, accessibility of positive charges, and the complexity of heavy
  atom adducts.
