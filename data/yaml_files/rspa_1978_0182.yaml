tldr: This article explores the nonlinear behavior of electron plasma waves and their
  decay into ion cyclotron waves in a magnetic field. The authors describe experimental
  results and related theory, focusing on the specific case of ion cyclotron modes.
  They demonstrate a method of exciting these modes without also exciting ion acoustic
  modes, allowing for the identification of the decay product waves.
