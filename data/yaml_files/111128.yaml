tldr: The author, John Dickinson, studied the supply of water from the chalk stratum
  in the London area. He observed the influence of various factors on the natural
  outflow of subterranean water through springs and rivers. Dickinson also experimented
  with a method to drain off water artificially, which could potentially affect the
  flow of rivers and springs. He concluded that the season of rainfall plays a significant
  role in the supply of these springs, and that artificial drainage could be possible.
