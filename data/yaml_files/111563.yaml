tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the influence of white light, different
  colored rays, and darkness on the development, growth, and nutrition of animals
  and plants. The results showed that animal development is not directly influenced
  by light, while plant development requires light for its nutritive processes. This
  research challenges preconceived notions about the role of light in animal and plant
  development.
