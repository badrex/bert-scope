tldr: This article calculates the binding energy of a K-absorption edge in heavy atoms
  using the Hartree model and self-consistent field calculations. The authors consider
  the interaction of the electron with the nucleus, other electrons, and the outer
  electrons. They find that the potential due to the outer electrons can be written
  in the form of a large constant potential with a small correction. The results are
  in good agreement with experimental data.
