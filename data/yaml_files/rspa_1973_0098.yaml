tldr: This study investigates the attenuation of longitudinal ultrasound in superconducting
  zinc and cadmium, analyzing the temperature dependence of the electronic attenuation
  and energy gaps in these metals. The results reveal anisotropy in the energy gaps,
  which is not explained by a simple model. A more realistic model is proposed, highlighting
  the complexity of the energy-gap distributions in zinc and cadmium.
