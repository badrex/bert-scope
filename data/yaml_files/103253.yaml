tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed and described the circulation
  of blood in fishes and eels. He discovered that the blood is carried through a series
  of vessels and valves, which help regulate the flow of blood. His observations led
  him to believe that a similar system exists in human beings, with valves controlling
  the flow of blood in the arteries and veins.
