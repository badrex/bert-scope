tldr: This paper investigates the efficiency of positively and negatively charged
  ions as condensation nuclei in the atmosphere. The author found that water condenses
  much more readily on negative ions than on positive ions, which suggests that negative
  electricity will be carried down by precipitation to the earth's surface. The study
  also provides evidence that ions may be present in the atmosphere, but they cannot
  be considered free ions unless ionization is developed during the process of producing
  supersaturation.
