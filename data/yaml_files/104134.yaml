tldr: The Steelyard Balance Swing is a mechanical device invented by Timothy Sheldrake
  to help correct body deformities and improve overall health. The swing works by
  suspending the user with cords under their arms, allowing their body weight to stretch
  contracted muscles and realign the spine. Regular use of the swing can help restore
  a more symmetrical and healthy body shape.
