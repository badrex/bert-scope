tldr: This study investigates the dynamics of a major stratospheric warming event
  in 1984-85 using satellite data and a numerical model. The authors found that strong
  temperature gradients, referred to as "fronts," developed in the stratosphere during
  the warming. These fronts were similar to those observed in the upper troposphere,
  and their presence highlights the importance of better spatial resolution in understanding
  the complex dynamics of the middle atmosphere.
