tldr: The author, Henry Miles, conducted a study comparing the temperature readings
  of two thermometers placed inside and outside his chamber. He observed a significant
  difference in temperature readings between the two thermometers, especially during
  a sudden change in weather conditions. This led him to question the usefulness of
  indoor thermometers for determining outdoor temperatures and suggested that external
  factors, such as subterranean heat and wind direction, may influence temperature
  changes.
