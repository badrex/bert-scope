tldr: The authors conducted experiments to prove the objective reality of combination
  and summation tones using a tuning fork, a Helmholtz wind siren, and photographic
  techniques. They demonstrated the presence of difference tones and summation tones
  through interference patterns and discussed the effects of exposure time and plate
  velocity on the photographic documentation of these tones.
