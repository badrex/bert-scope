revised_title: Jahn-Teller Effect and Symmetric-Top Molecules in Electronically Degenerate
  States

tldr: The authors develop a physical theory to interpret the infra-red, Raman, and
  microwave spectra of molecules in orbitally degenerate electronic states. They derive
  group-theoretical selection rules and discuss the electrical and mechanical properties
  of molecules exhibiting the Jahn-Teller effect. The study focuses on the rotational
  and vibrational spectra of symmetric-top molecules in electronically degenerate
  states.
