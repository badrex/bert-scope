tldr: This article discusses the theory of rubber elasticity using both the dynamical
  approach of Boltzmann and the thermodynamic approach of Gibbs. The authors argue
  that these approaches can be valuable in studying rubber elasticity and provide
  a deeper understanding of the problem. They also explore the molecular dynamics
  of polymers and the challenges associated with the non-linear nature of the Boltzmann
  equation.
