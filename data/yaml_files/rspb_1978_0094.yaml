tldr: The authors discovered an abnormal membrane glycoprotein associated with malignancy
  in various types of tumors. This glycoprotein, present as a dimer, appears to have
  a specific binding site for glucose. The research also suggests that this glycoprotein
  may be a component of the system that transports glucose into the cell.
