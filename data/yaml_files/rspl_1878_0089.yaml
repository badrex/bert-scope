tldr: The authors, G. D. Liveing and J. Dewar, study the reversal of absorption lines
  in metallic vapours, specifically magnesium, potassium, and sodium, when mixed with
  hydrogen. They also investigate the optical properties of biaxal crystals and the
  velocity of normal propagation of plane waves in these crystals. Their findings
  contribute to the understanding of light refraction and the behavior of metallic
  vapours in different conditions.
