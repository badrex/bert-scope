revised_title: Characterization of Invariant Functionals in Crystal Defects

tldr: The authors study a class of functionals that are invariant under isochoric
  changes of domain and find that it contains strictly the null lagrangians. They
  provide a characterization of this class and discuss its implications for variational
  problems involving crystals with defects.
