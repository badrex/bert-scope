tldr: The authors present a new and simpler recurrence relation for calculating the
  matrix elements of the rotation group, which is more efficient than previous methods.
  They also provide a systematic procedure for using this relation and discuss its
  advantages for both desk and electronic computers. The authors have compiled extensive
  tables of calculated coefficients, which are available for use in various physical
  problems.
