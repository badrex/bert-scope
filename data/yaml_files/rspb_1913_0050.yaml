tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats and cats to study the effects of thyroid
  feeding on carbohydrate metabolism. They found that feeding rats with thyroid gland
  significantly reduced the glycogen content in their livers, indicating a direct
  impact on carbohydrate metabolism. The authors also observed that thyroid feeding
  affected nitrogen distribution in the urine, but the exact relationship between
  thyroid hormone and nitrogen metabolism remains uncertain. These findings highlight
  the complex and variable effects of thyroid hormone on metabolism in the normal
  organism.
