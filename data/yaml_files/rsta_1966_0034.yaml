tldr: The authors discuss the deformation of solids caused by the impact of liquids,
  focusing on the oblique impact of a jet on a plane surface. They explore the implications
  of this phenomenon in various applications, such as rain damage in aircraft and
  missiles, blade erosion in steam turbines, and cavitation erosion. The study provides
  insights into the mechanics of the impact region and the distribution of pressure,
  contributing to a better understanding of these real-world issues.
