tldr: This article investigates whether solids have definite volatilizing points under
  different pressures, similar to how liquids have boiling points. The authors conducted
  experiments with various substances, including water, acetic acid, benzene, naphthalene,
  and camphor, and found that solids do have specific temperatures of evaporation
  corresponding to definite pressures. The results show that the difference between
  the temperatures of evaporation and boiling points for solids and liquids, respectively,
  is extremely small.
