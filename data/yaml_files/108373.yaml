tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the elliptic polarization of light
  in reflection from various surfaces, including metallic surfaces and films. They
  observed that the ellipticity of the reflected light changes with different substances
  and surface conditions, and that this phenomenon can be used to better understand
  the nature of light polarization and the properties of metallic surfaces and films.
