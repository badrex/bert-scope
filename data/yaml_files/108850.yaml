tldr: The author conducted experiments on the compressibility of slate and quartz
  rocks to understand their behavior during earthquake waves. They discovered that
  the softest specimens of quartz rock are more compressible than the softest slate
  when compressed in the direction of or parallel to the lamination. The experiments
  also showed that the rocks have different powers of transmitting wave-impulses depending
  on the amount of primary compression. These findings can help in understanding the
  behavior of rocks during earthquakes and the transmission of wave-impulses.
