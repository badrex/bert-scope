tldr: The authors analyzed the paramagnetic resonance spectra of praseodymium, neodymium,
  and samarium magnesium nitrates at low temperatures. They observed anisotropic spectroscopic
  splitting factors and hyperfine structures in the spectra. The nuclear hyperfine
  structure was responsible for the principal contribution to the specific heat of
  each salt. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties and crystal
  lattice behavior of rare-earth double nitrates.
