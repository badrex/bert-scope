tldr: This article discusses the experimental considerations and design criteria for
  implementing a whole body multiple sensitive point nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
  imaging system. The authors describe the mode of NMR excitation and detection, the
  use of field gradients, and data processing methods. They also discuss the design
  of an instrument to implement NMR imaging techniques at whole body size, focusing
  on techniques to increase versatility and ease of use. The system is being used
  to image the human head and torso, with the potential to produce images of comparable
  quality to those produced on smaller machines.
