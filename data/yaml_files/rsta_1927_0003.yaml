tldr: The author, in collaboration with the late Prof. H. Kamerlingh Onnes, investigates
  paramagnetism at low temperatures. They determine the susceptibilities with an accuracy
  of about 1% using the Faraday method and a quartz microbalance. The experiments
  are conducted in a cryostat with liquid air as the cooling agent, and the results
  provide insights into the behavior of materials under extreme conditions.
