tldr: The author analyzes the energies of alpha and gamma rays emitted by radioactive
  atoms, discovering that they can be arranged in pairs with sums equal to multiples
  of a constant, 3.85. This constant represents a general atomic property, and the
  author explores its implications for understanding nuclear energy and the behavior
  of radioactive substances.
