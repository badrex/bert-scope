tldr: The author presents a simple approximation for the profile of the highest progressive
  and standing waves in deep water using conformal transformation. The approximation
  is based on a hexagonal and square boundary for progressive and standing waves,
  respectively. This method agrees with previous numerical calculations and experimental
  observations, providing a useful tool for understanding and calculating the force
  of high waves against structures.
