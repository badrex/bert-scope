tldr: The authors suggest that some transient ionic clouds, responsible for low-level
  sporadic radio reflexions, may be due to large cosmic ray showers. They show that
  cascade cosmic ray showers of sufficient energy to produce some of these radio reflexions
  certainly exist, but there is not enough evidence to decide whether any of the observed
  echoes are actually due to such showers. More conclusive evidence could be obtained
  from the frequency-size distribution of the radio echoes observed from a horizontal
  or vertically directed beam.
