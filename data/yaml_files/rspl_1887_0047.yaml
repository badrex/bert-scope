tldr: The author examines fossil remains of a Chelonian reptile, Ceratochelys sthenurus,
  found on Lord Howe Island. The reptile is closely related to living species Chelydra,
  Gypochelys, and Platysternum. The discovery of this reptile is significant as it
  represents a group of Chelonia not previously found in the Australian fauna. The
  author also discusses the analysis of the reptile's bones, skull, and caudal sheaths,
  and compares them to other known species.
