tldr: The authors, Latimer Clark and Sir William Thomson, developed a standard voltaic
  battery with a constant electromotive force to address the need for a uniform difference
  of electric potential in electrical measurements. They created a battery element
  using zinc, mercury, and their sulfates, which maintained a consistent electromotive
  force for extended periods. This battery served as a standard for comparing other
  elements and sources of potential in electrical measurements.
