tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between friction
  and surface roughness using emery papers. They discovered that the coefficient of
  friction varies with the surface roughness and found that the main variable part
  of the friction is a function of the ratio of the radii of the emery particles in
  the two surfaces. The friction is a minimum when the radii are equal. The remaining
  part of the friction is practically constant and is due to hysteresis losses in
  the elastic backing.
