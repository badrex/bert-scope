tldr: The author, G. Gore, presents a new method to study the electrolytic diffusion
  of liquids and shares his observations on the process. He uses a unique apparatus
  to test the diffusion of two liquids with different specific gravities and finds
  that the liquid continuously diffuses downwards through the meniscus during the
  passage of the upward current. This research provides insights into the behavior
  of liquids during electrolysis and the role of diffusion in the process.
