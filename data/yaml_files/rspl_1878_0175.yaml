tldr: The author discusses the existence of a reducing substance in the blood, apart
  from sugar, which is stable and resistant to putrefaction. This substance amounts
  to.200 to.300 per 1,000 and should be deducted from the given sugar levels in the
  blood. The author also mentions astronomical, magnetic, and meteorological observations
  made in the years 1859, 1875, and 1876 under the direction of Sir George B. Airy.
