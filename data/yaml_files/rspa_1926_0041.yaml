tldr: This article investigates the relationship between atmospheric ozone and terrestrial
  magnetism. The author analyzes ozone observations and magnetic character figures
  to determine if there is a connection between high ozone levels and increased magnetic
  disturbance. The results suggest that high ozone levels may precede days of high
  magnetic character, but further research is needed to confirm this finding.
