tldr: This article explores how emotions influence memory and cognition, with a focus
  on mood-congruent learning and state-dependent retrieval. The author discusses how
  people selectively attend to and learn more about stimuli that match their emotional
  state, and how emotional states can be used as retrieval cues for memories. The
  findings have implications for understanding how emotions impact diverse cognitive
  processes and judgments.
