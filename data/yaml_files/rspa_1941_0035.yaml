tldr: This article explores the molecular structure and vibrations of urea and guanidinium
  using quantum mechanical resonance theory. The authors calculate the vibrations
  and force constants for both molecules, finding that the C-N bond in urea has approximately
  28% double-bond character, while the guanidinium ion has complete resonance with
  each C-N bond having single-bond character. The study provides insights into the
  electronic structure and bonding of these molecules, which can be useful for understanding
  their chemical behavior and properties.
