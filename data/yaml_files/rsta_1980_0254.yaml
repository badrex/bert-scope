tldr: The article discusses the development of a compact, high-performance streak
  camera system using a new streak tube with a microchannel plate as an electron image
  intensifier. The system features a temporal resolution of better than 10 ps and
  a linear dynamic range of better than 100. The advancements in this technology have
  enabled the study of high-speed phenomena and beam diagnostics in various applications,
  such as picosecond excitations and laser-induced plasmas.
