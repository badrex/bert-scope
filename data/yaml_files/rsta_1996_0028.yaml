tldr: This article discusses the state-of-the-art of nonlinear optical materials suitable
  for ultrafast all-optical applications. It covers progress in the third-order nonlinear
  properties of semiconductors, polymers, and glasses and their applications to devices.
  The article also explores a second-order nonlinearity-based approach called "cascading"
  for all-optical effects. The focus is on applications that involve manipulating
  signals, such as all-optical logic, routing functions, and wavelength shifting,
  which are essential for high bit rate communications.
