tldr: The article discusses the biosynthesis of cardenolides, bufadienolides, and
  steroid sapogenins in plants. It explores the role of pregnenolone as a precursor
  for these compounds and the enzymes involved in their formation. The article also
  highlights the differences in biosynthesis pathways between plants and animals.
