tldr: The author, William Shanks, extended the value of the base of Napier's logarithms
  to 205 decimal places using formulae investigated by Mr. J. R. Young. The article
  provides the computed values for the logarithms of 2, 3, 5, and 10, as well as the
  modulus of the common system of logarithms.
