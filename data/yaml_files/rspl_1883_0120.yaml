tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the magnetic properties of iron and
  steel. They discovered that magnetism in these materials is due to the inherent
  polarity of their molecules, which cannot be destroyed or augmented. The author
  found that neutrality occurs when the polar forces are balanced, and explained how
  this affects the performance of electro-magnets. The research also revealed that
  the exterior layers of iron and steel have a higher magnetic capacity than the interior
  layers, and that the remaining magnetism after the inducing force is removed is
  a form of partial neutrality.
