tldr: The authors explore the global isometric embedding of pseudo-Riemannian manifolds,
  demonstrating that any such manifold can be embedded into a pseudo-Euclidean space.
  They also provide a new proof using a Euclidean space of lower dimension and apply
  the result to the space-time of relativity.
