tldr: This study investigates the effects of posterior pituitary extract on gastric
  secretion in animals. The researchers found that pituitary extract significantly
  reduces the secretion of acid juice stimulated by histamine and insulin. The extract
  also inhibits the volume of gastric juice, suggesting a role in regulating alimentary
  blood flow and secretion.
