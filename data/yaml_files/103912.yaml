tldr: John Senex invented a device to accurately adjust celestial globes, allowing
  them to display star positions for any time and latitude. The device ensures that
  the diurnal motion axis aligns with the ecliptic, enabling accurate representation
  of rising and setting stars, as well as other phenomena related to the Earth's rotation.
