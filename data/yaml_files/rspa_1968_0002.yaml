tldr: The authors studied the reaction of nitrogen atoms with acetaldehyde using mass
  spectrometry. They found that the main stable products were HCN, H2, and CO, with
  a small amount of glyoxal also formed. The reaction was first-order in both nitrogen
  atoms and acetaldehyde. The authors also identified a product yielding ions with
  m/e = 43, which they proposed to be the radical CH2CHO.
