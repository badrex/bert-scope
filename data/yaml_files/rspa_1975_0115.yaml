tldr: The authors study the steady plane flow of an incompressible, inviscid fluid
  falling under gravity from a horizontal slot. They develop a nonlinear integral
  equation for the free streamline and provide a constructive proof of its existence.
  The method is then applied to related problems, offering insights into the behavior
  of the fluid jet and the effect of a rigid upper lid on the flow.
