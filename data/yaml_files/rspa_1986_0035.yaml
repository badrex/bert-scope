tldr: This article presents a study on the pair correlation function and density profile
  of a system of hard spheres near a hard wall using the Percus-Yevick and hypernetted
  chain approximations. The results show that the Percus-Yevick approximation is similar
  in accuracy to the bulk fluid, while the hypernetted chain approximation is more
  challenging to obtain numerically and less accurate. Both approximations predict
  the correct asymmetries between the values of the pair correlation functions for
  pairs of hard spheres parallel or normal to the surface of the wall.
