tldr: The authors describe an electrical calculating machine that can solve sets of
  linear algebraic simultaneous equations using alternating current transformers.
  The machine is capable of handling equations with up to ten unknowns and has been
  tested to provide accurate results for most engineering and physics problems. The
  machine can also be used for the direct solution of equations of condition by the
  method of least squares.
