tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the most effective method of constructing
  a voltaic apparatus for chemical research. They found that the size and number of
  plates in the battery should be adjusted according to the purpose, with larger plates
  needed for igniting perfect conductors and more plates required for overcoming the
  resistance of imperfect conductors. The author also preferred a new method of constructing
  the trough entirely of wood, making it easier to clean and repair.
