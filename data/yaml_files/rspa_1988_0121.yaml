tldr: The authors study the scattering of sound waves by two semi-infinite parallel
  staggered plates using the Wiener-Hopf technique. They develop an explicit matrix
  Wiener-Hopf factorization to solve the problem and derive an asymptotic expression
  for the field scattered to infinity. This work contributes to understanding sound
  scattering and has applications in acoustics and engineering.
