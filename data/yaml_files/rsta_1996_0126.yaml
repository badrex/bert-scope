tldr: The article discusses the challenges and transient phenomena encountered in
  secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) depth profiling using oxygen bombardment.
  It focuses on the effects of oxygen incorporation, sputtering yield changes, and
  ionization probability increases on the accuracy of depth calibration and impurity
  analysis in silicon samples. The authors propose a simple sputtering-oxidation model
  to describe these transient phenomena and provide suggestions for optimizing operating
  parameters to improve depth calibration and analysis of shallow impurity distributions.
