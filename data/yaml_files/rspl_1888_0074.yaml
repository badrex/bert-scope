tldr: This article explores the hydrodynamics of rotating liquid spheroids and the
  oscillations within them. It discusses the methods used to find the waves or oscillations
  on a gravitating mass of liquid that is rotating as a rigid body. The author applies
  Poincaré's methods to the case of a fluid spheroid, using tesseral or zonal harmonics
  to simplify the problem and determine the frequencies of the various free waves.
  The article also covers the stability of the liquid spheroid and the effects of
  external forces on the tides.
