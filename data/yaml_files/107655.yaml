tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the daily variations of a horizontal
  magnetic needle under the influence of magnets. By adjusting the position and strength
  of the magnets, the author observed significant deviations in the needle's direction,
  which could be attributed to the Earth's magnetic field. This research helped to
  better understand the daily changes in the Earth's magnetic field and the behavior
  of magnetic needles.
