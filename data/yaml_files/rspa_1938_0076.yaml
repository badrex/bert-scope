tldr: The authors investigate the adsorption of vapors at plane surfaces of mica and
  develop an apparatus to study the process. They find that multimolecular films form
  at pressures below saturation, and the adsorption is not affected by the packing
  method of the mica. The experiments provide evidence that the polymolecular films
  exist on the cleavage surfaces of the plates and have properties that differentiate
  them from normal bulk liquids.
