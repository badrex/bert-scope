tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a new high-pressure combustion chamber
  to study the influence of pressure on the flame spectra of hydrogen and carbonic
  oxide burning in oxygen. They found that increasing pressure led to a stronger continuous
  spectrum and reduced intensity of bands in the flame spectra. The results showed
  that the direct oxidation of carbonic oxide in the flame becomes more dominant with
  rising pressure.
