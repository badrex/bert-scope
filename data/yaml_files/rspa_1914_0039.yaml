tldr: This study investigates the influence of sulphonates on the hydrolytic activity
  of sulphonic acids. The authors found that the presence of neutral salts, such as
  potassium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, and cadmium toluene parasulphonate,
  can affect the activity of toluene parasulphonic acid. The results show that the
  salt has a greater influence when the proportion of acid is smaller. The authors
  discuss the implications of these findings for the electrolytic dissociation hypothesis
  and the role of undissociated and dissociated molecules in chemical reactions.
