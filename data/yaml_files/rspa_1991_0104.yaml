tldr: The authors explore the resonance scattering of axial gravitational waves by
  stars with uniform energy density. They find that for stars with radii in the range
  of 2.25 to 2.50, quasinormal axial modes of oscillation are possible. The study
  demonstrates the existence of these modes as a further example of what is possible
  within the framework of general relativity.
