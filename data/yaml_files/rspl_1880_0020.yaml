tldr: The author conducted research on the color pigments found in human urine, specifically
  normal urobilin and febrile urobilin. They discovered that normal urobilin is identical
  to choletelin and is produced by oxidation from bilirubin. Febrile urobilin, on
  the other hand, can be produced by reduction of choletelin, normal urobilin, and
  a similar body produced by oxidation of hsematoin. The author also found that the
  chromogen of febrile urobilin exists in normal urine.
