tldr: The authors present a method to approximate the solution of physical problems
  involving differential equations using finite differences. They apply this method
  to calculate the stress function in a masonry dam. The process involves replacing
  analysis with arithmetic, representing continuous functions with numbers, and using
  central differences for differentials. The error due to finite central differences
  can be made small, and more exact values can be extrapolated.
