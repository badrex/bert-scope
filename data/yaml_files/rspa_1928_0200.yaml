tldr: The authors analyzed the spectrum of doubly-ionized nitrogen (N III) and identified
  various terms and their combinations. They used spectroscopic methods to determine
  the values of these terms and found that the observed lines followed the Rydberg
  formula. This research helped in understanding the atomic structure and transitions
  of nitrogen atoms.
