tldr: The authors conducted electrophysiological studies on oxytocin and vasopressin-secreting
  neurons in the paraventricular and supraoptic nuclei of the hypothalamus in lactating
  rats. They found that these neurons can be differentiated into two functionally
  distinct populations based on their firing patterns during reflex milk ejection
  and haemorrhage. Oxytocin-secreting neurons show a high-frequency discharge before
  milk ejection, while vasopressin-secreting neurons adopt a phasic pattern of firing
  during vasopressin release induced by haemorrhage.
