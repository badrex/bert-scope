tldr: The article discusses the greenhouse effects of various atmospheric constituents,
  focusing on carbon dioxide, chlorofluoromethanes, and aerosols. It explains how
  increasing concentrations of these substances can lead to rising surface temperatures
  and examines the limitations of current atmospheric models used to predict these
  changes. The author highlights the importance of cloud cover and its interaction
  with other factors in determining the overall impact of greenhouse gases on climate.
