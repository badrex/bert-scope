tldr: The article presents a mathematical model of electron transport in photosynthesis,
  focusing on the thermodynamic necessity for photosystem II regulation. The model
  includes photosystems II and I, plastoquinone, and NADP as electron acceptors, and
  explains how the balance of excitation rates prevents over-reduction or over-energization
  of the electron transport chain. The model also suggests a possible mechanism for
  light and shade tolerance in plants.
