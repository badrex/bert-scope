tldr: This article explores the role of calcium in plant development and form generation.
  It discusses how mechanical signals, such as touch and wind, affect plant growth
  and development by elevating cytosolic calcium concentrations. The authors also
  investigate the involvement of intracellular calcium in the perception and transduction
  of mechanical signals in plants, using molecular genetic approaches. They highlight
  the importance of understanding how calcium mediates specific responses to different
  signals and the need for targeted screening protocols to isolate vital components
  of the mechanical signal transduction pathway in plants.
