tldr: The author analyzes various salts of quinidine and its reactions with iodide
  of ethyl. They describe the properties and methods of preparation for several quinidine
  salts, including platinum-salt, gold-salt, nitrate-of-silver salt, mercuro-hydrochlorate,
  zinco-hydrochlorate, basic chloride-of-zinc salt, oxalate, and picrate. They also
  study the reaction between quinidine and iodide of ethyl, resulting in the formation
  of iodide of ethyl-quinidine and its subsequent reactions.
