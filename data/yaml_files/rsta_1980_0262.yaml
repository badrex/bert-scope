tldr: The article discusses the development and performance of high-power neodymium
  glass laser systems for fusion research. The author describes the construction of
  various glass laser systems, including Gekko II, Gekko IV, and modules of Gekko
  XII, and their applications in fusion research. The article also highlights the
  importance of laser glass, optical components, and system performance in experimental
  work. The author presents experimental results and discusses the scientific feasibility
  of inertial confinement fusion.
