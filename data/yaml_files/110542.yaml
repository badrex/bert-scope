tldr: This study investigates the diurnal inequality of tide heights, particularly
  at Plymouth and Singapore, and the mean level of the sea. The author finds that
  the period for these tides is the fifth lunar transit preceding each tide. The research
  also examines the diurnal inequalities at other locations, such as Liverpool, Bristol,
  Leith, and the east coast of America, and observes a regular pattern along the coastlines.
