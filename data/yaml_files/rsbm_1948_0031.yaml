tldr: This obituary celebrates the life and work of Alfred North Whitehead, a mathematician
  and philosopher who made significant contributions to the fields of logic, universal
  algebra, and non-Euclidean geometry. Whitehead, along with Bertrand Russell, developed
  the groundbreaking work Principia Mathematica, which aimed to prove that mathematics
  is a part of logic. His work has had a profound impact on the growth of logic and
  the understanding of the foundations of mathematics.
