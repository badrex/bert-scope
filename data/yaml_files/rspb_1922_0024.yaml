tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the response of frog melanophores
  to pituitary extracts. They discovered that pituitary extracts induce extreme melanophore
  expansion in frogs, and this effect is mainly due to the posterior lobe of the pituitary
  gland. This research provides insights into the role of the pituitary gland in pigmental
  response and color adaptation.
