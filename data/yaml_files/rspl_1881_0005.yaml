tldr: The author studied the coefficients of expansion of lead di-iodide and an alloy
  of lead and silver iodide. They found that the iodide of lead has three coefficients
  of expansion, while the lead silver iodide alloy contracts when heated before expanding
  again at higher temperatures. The author also compared the alloy's properties to
  those of other iodide compounds.
