tldr: The author conducted experiments on the compression of water and other fluids
  using a high-pressure apparatus. They discovered that water can be compressed significantly
  under high pressure, and some gases, like atmospheric air and carburetted hydrogen,
  can be partially liquefied under certain pressures. The author also observed that
  concentrated acetic acid crystallizes under high pressure.
