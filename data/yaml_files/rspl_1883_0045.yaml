tldr: The author, William Crookes, discovered a new element in the rare earths group
  by analyzing the unique citron-colored band in the spectrum of various substances.
  The new element was found to be present in zircon and other minerals rich in rare
  earths, and it was not calcium as previously thought. The new element, likely belonging
  to the group of earthy metals, remains elusive and requires further research.
