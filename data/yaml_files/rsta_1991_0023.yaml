tldr: This article discusses the theory and examples of incommensurate structures
  in solids, focusing on their origin, general theory, and the role of incommensurate
  structures in mineral solid solutions. The author reviews formal theories and provides
  examples of incommensurate structures in simple compounds like biphenyl and quartz,
  as well as in mineral examples like plagioclase feldspar solid solutions.
