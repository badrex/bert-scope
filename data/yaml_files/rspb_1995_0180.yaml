revised_title: Multiple Origins of Anaerobic Ciliates with Hydrogenosomes
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Ciliates
semantic_tags:
- '''Ciliates'''
- '''Hydrogenosomes'''
- '''Anaerobic organisms'''
- '''Phylogenetics'''
- '''Evolution of organelles'''
tldr: The authors conducted a study on anaerobic ciliates with hydrogenosomes and
  found that there were at least four separate origins of these organelles. This research
  provides a phylogenetic framework to further understand the evolution and origins
  of hydrogenosomal enzymes in ciliates.
