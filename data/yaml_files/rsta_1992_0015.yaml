tldr: This study presents a new derivation of an archetypal equation for ship capsize
  studies, focusing on the coupling action between heave and roll. The authors explore
  the effects of direct and parametric wave excitation on ship stability, providing
  valuable insights into the mechanics of ship capsize and the importance of transient
  size. The research suggests that understanding these dynamics can help improve boat
  designs and survival in extreme conditions.
