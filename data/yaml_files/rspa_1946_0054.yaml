tldr: The author investigates the conservation of linear and angular momentum in kinematic
  relativity, deriving equations of motion for a set of gravitating particles. They
  find that the conservation of linear momentum holds only for a collinear set of
  particles, while a modification of the law of conservation is needed for other cases.
  The author also obtains a relation corresponding to the integral of angular momentum.
