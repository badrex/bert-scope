tldr: The authors conducted various experiments to measure the strength of metals
  on a sub-micrometre scale, using techniques like indentation, blunting, compression
  of small crystals, and bending of thin filaments. They observed that the yield stress
  decreased with plastic strain in all experiments, and the maximum strengths were
  higher than previously calculated values. The results suggest that dislocation generation
  in small volumes may involve a source mechanism other than the Frank-Read type.
