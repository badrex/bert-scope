tldr: This article discusses the role of organic radicals as intermediates in vitamin
  B12-dependent enzymatic reactions. The authors present theoretical and model studies
  supporting the intermediacy of radicals in reactions catalyzed by diol dehydratase
  and methylmalonyl mutase enzymes. They also explore the activation of alkyl groups
  bonded to cobalt in corrinoid-like environments using model compounds, such as alkylcobaloximes.
