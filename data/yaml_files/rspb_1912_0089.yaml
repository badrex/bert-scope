tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of arsenic, in the form
  of arsenphenylglycin, on Trypanosoma gambiense, a parasite transmitted by Glossina
  palpalis. They found that feeding flies on blood containing arsenic affected the
  flagellates in the fly's gut but did not harm the flagellates in the salivary glands.
  This supports the theory that salivary gland flagellates are the true infecting
  form of the parasite. The author also discovered that arsenic-containing blood did
  not prevent the development of flagellates in the fly or create an arsenic-resistant
  strain.
