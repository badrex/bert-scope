tldr: The authors conducted a phenomenological analysis of the martensitic transformation
  in face-centered cubic manganese alloys, focusing on lattice vibrations and elastic
  phenomena. They discovered that the transformation is accompanied by a critical
  reduction of stiffness parameters and an anomalous softening of longitudinal phonons.
  The analysis provides insights into the material's behavior and sets the stage for
  further research on the topic.
