tldr: In this article, E. Halley presents several questions and difficulties related
  to the nature of light and diaphanous bodies. He discusses the transparency of materials,
  the propagation of light through different mediums, and the possibility of light
  being a wave-like motion. Halley also questions the nature of matter and its composition,
  considering the ideas of the Epicurean and Atomical Philosophers.
