tldr: The author, Richard Chenevix, conducted experiments to discover the nature of
  palladium, a newly announced simple metal. He found that palladium was a compound
  of platina and mercury. Chenevix's experiments led to further research on the interaction
  between platina and mercury, which has implications for the understanding of metal
  alloys and chemical reactions.
