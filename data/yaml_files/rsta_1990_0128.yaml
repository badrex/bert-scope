tldr: The author discusses non-parametric continuous-time survival analysis using
  the Lexis diagram, a (time, age) coordinate system representing individual lives
  by line segments. The main focus is on statistical inference and estimation of death
  intensities in the Lexis diagram, with potential applications in morbidity and mortality
  studies.
