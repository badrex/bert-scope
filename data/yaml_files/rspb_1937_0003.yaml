tldr: The author's research on Armillaria mellea, a fungal root disease affecting
  tea plants, reveals that the fungus penetrates healthy plant roots without needing
  wounds. The study suggests a new method of control by preventing the fungus from
  infecting new tea plantations by clearing infected forest lands before planting
  crops. The findings also provide insights into the fungus's penetration and growth
  in plant tissues.
