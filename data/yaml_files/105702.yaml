tldr: The author, Henry Horne, investigates the properties of Virginia black sand,
  a rich iron ore, and conducts experiments to extract the metal from it. He discovers
  that the sand contains a significant amount of iron, but it is strongly bonded with
  a stubborn earth. After several trials and using a different flux, Horne successfully
  extracts a malleable metal from the sand. This discovery could have significant
  implications for iron production and trade.
