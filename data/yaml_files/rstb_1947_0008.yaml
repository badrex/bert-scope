tldr: The authors conducted a pollen analysis of lake sediments from the Windermere
  Basin to study the post-glacial history of British vegetation. They discovered a
  well-developed late-glacial succession and found that the Windermere profile carried
  the story back into the late-glacial period. The study helps to fit this region
  into the general picture of the Quaternary history of the British Isles and offers
  a possibility of applying a geochronological time-scale.
