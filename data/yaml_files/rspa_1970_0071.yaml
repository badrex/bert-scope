tldr: The authors studied the photolysis of cycloheptatriene and discovered that,
  in addition to the dominant product toluene, the reaction also produces small amounts
  of benzene, cyclopentadiene, methane, and acetylene. They investigated the mechanisms
  and energetics of the formation of these minor products and found that they involve
  different pathways and energy barriers.
