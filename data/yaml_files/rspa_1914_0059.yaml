tldr: This article explores the effect of magnetons on the scattering of beta rays.
  The author considers charged particles moving in the equatorial plane of a fixed
  magnetic doublet and demonstrates that molecular magnetic fields discovered by Weiss
  are efficient agents in scattering beta particles. The study provides insights into
  the behavior of particles in magnetic fields and has implications for understanding
  atomic and particle physics.
