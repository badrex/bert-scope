tldr: This article discusses the challenges and potential solutions for controlling
  the spread of bracken, an invasive plant in Britain. Bracken causes direct loss
  of grazing land, is poisonous to livestock, and affects wildlife conservation. The
  author explores the possibility of biological control using exotic insects from
  the Southern Hemisphere, describing potential control agents and the constraints
  and opportunities of this approach. Additionally, the article highlights the need
  to consider legal, political, environmental, and socio-economic factors before attempting
  biological control.
