tldr: The author examines the flask-shaped ectoderm and spongoblasts in the Keratosa
  sponge species, Cacospongia scalaris, and Aplysilla sp. They discover that the flask-shaped
  cells are excretory and are identical to the spongoblasts. This finding challenges
  previous assumptions about the structure and function of the sponge's outer surface
  and provides new insights into the anatomy and biology of sponges.
