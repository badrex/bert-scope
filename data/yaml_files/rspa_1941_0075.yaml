tldr: This article presents an experimental study of diffuse X-ray reflexion by single
  crystals. The authors discuss the various factors affecting the intensity, shape,
  size, position, and persistence of diffuse spots, and their relation to the crystal's
  nature, structure, perfection, orientation, and temperature. They also explore the
  use of diffuse spot patterns as a method of crystal structure determination and
  the physical significance of diffusely reflecting regions in reciprocal space.
