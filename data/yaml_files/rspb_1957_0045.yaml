tldr: The authors studied the cytochrome system in individual tissues of the Cecropia
  silkworm using low-temperature spectroscopy. They found that during metamorphosis,
  the cytochrome system undergoes significant changes, with some components disappearing
  and reappearing during the pupal diapause. The results suggest that the cytochrome
  system is closely linked to the action of the prothoracic gland hormone, which plays
  a role in the insect's growth and development.
