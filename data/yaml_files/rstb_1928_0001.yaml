tldr: The author investigates the causes and ecological significance of stomatal frequency
  in woodland plants. They find a negative correlation between leaf size and stomatal
  frequency, meaning smaller leaves have more stomata per unit area. The study also
  shows that stomatal frequency increases from the base to the apex of a plant, with
  radical leaves having fewer stomata than cauline leaves. This research highlights
  the importance of understanding how environmental factors affect plant anatomy and
  adaptation.
