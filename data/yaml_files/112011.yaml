tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effects of impact, vibratory
  action, and long-term load changes on wrought-iron girders. They found that girders
  of ordinary construction are not safe when subjected to violent disturbances equivalent
  to one-third the weight that would break them. However, they exhibit great tenacity
  when subjected to one-fourth the load. The author suggests that a standard measure
  of strength and definite construction principles are needed for the safe construction
  of wrought-iron bridges.
