tldr: The authors studied the transfer of unsaturated helium II films on glass and
  german silver surfaces using a heat conduction method. They found that the critical
  transfer rate decreases when the vapor pressure over the film is slightly below
  the saturation value. The critical temperature for the onset of superfluidity is
  independent of the substrate, and the temperature dependence of the transfer rate
  is different from that of the saturated film.
