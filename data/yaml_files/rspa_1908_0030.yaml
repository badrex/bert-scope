tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the decomposition of ozone by heat
  and the effect of various substances and surfaces on the reaction rate. They found
  that the reaction is mostly first-order and that certain materials, such as glass
  tubes and metallic oxides, can significantly increase the rate of decomposition.
  The author also discovered that the presence of certain metals, like platinum, can
  actually decrease the reaction rate.
