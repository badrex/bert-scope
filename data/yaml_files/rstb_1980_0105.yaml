tldr: This article discusses the importance of biological nitrogen fixation in meeting
  the increasing demand for agricultural nitrogen. It explores various short-term
  and long-term strategies to exploit existing and new biological processes, such
  as using legumes, genetic manipulation, and somatic hybridization, to improve agricultural
  productivity while minimizing the environmental impact of chemical nitrogen fertilizers.
