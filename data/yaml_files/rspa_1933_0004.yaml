tldr: This article describes experiments conducted on explosions of hydrogen-air and
  carbonic oxide-air mixtures at high initial pressures up to 1000 atmospheres. The
  authors discovered that nitrogen activation in carbonic oxide-air explosions increases
  with the density of the medium, and they observed nitric oxide formation in these
  explosions. They also designed and tested a new bomb capable of withstanding explosion
  pressures up to 10,000 atmospheres for further experiments.
