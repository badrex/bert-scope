tldr: The author, John Barton, examines the phenomena of light inflexion and compares
  the appearance of shadows at different distances. He proposes a hypothesis that
  light consists of material particles with a power of mutual repulsion, which can
  explain the deflection and curvature of light rays. The author also supports this
  theory by the analogy of the laws of heat and light, both exhibiting phenomena of
  reflection, refraction, and polarization.
