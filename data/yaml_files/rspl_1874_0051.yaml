tldr: The authors study the development of teeth in fish, specifically Elasmobranch
  and Teleostei species. They describe the process of tooth formation, the role of
  enamel-organs and dentine-papillae, and the differences in tooth development among
  various fish species. The research also highlights the similarities between fish
  and reptiles in tooth development.
