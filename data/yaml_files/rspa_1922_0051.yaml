tldr: The author analyzes the 27-day period in terrestrial magnetism using data from
  1858 to 1920. They find that the Earth's magnetic field is influenced by solar activity,
  and the 27-day period is related to the sunspot cycle. The study helps to understand
  the variations in the Earth's magnetic field and its impact on daily life.
