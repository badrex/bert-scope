tldr: The authors develop a general theory of plane stress for large elastic deformations
  of isotropic materials using complex variable notation. They introduce an approximation
  method for unsymmetrical problems and provide a general formulation of the second-order
  theory for two-dimensional problems, which can be applied to both plane stress and
  plane strain cases.
