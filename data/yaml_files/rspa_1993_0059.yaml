tldr: The authors present a rigorous mathematical formulation for the axisymmetric
  stress-transfer problem of an elastic cylindrical shell embedded in a semi-infinite
  solid. They use a set of ring-load Green's functions for the shell and a group of
  fundamental solutions for the half-space to reduce the problem to a pair of Fredholm
  integral equations. The study provides insights into the mechanical interaction
  between embedded cylindrical bodies and elastic media, with applications in geotechnical,
  structural, material, and aerospace engineering.
