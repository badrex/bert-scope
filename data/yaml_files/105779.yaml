tldr: Mr. Miller, a gardener at Cambridge, conducted an experiment in which he successfully
  grew 21,109 ears of wheat from a single grain. By dividing the plants multiple times,
  he was able to increase the number of plants and their yield. This experiment demonstrated
  the potential for improving crop yields and showed that even in poor soil, the plants
  could thrive. Mr. Miller plans to continue his experiments to further explore the
  possibilities of increasing agricultural productivity.
