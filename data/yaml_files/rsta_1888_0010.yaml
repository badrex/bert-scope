tldr: This article investigates a general theory of electric current induction in
  surfaces of any shape in the presence of an external magnetic field. The author
  explores the concept of current shells and develops a current function to determine
  the components of superficial currents. The study also discusses the magnetic potential
  and energy of a system of currents in conducting shells.
