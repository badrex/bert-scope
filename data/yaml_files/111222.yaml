tldr: This article presents evidence that toads and frogs can reproduce without the
  intermediate tadpole stage. The author shares observations of young toads and frogs
  found in unusual locations, such as cellars and gardens, where the tadpole stage
  would be impossible. The author suggests that these amphibians may be born alive
  or develop directly from the egg, challenging the traditional understanding of their
  reproduction.
