tldr: The authors study the architecture of an alluvial suite in southwest Wales,
  focusing on the rocks between the Townsend Tuff and Pickard Bay Tuff Beds (early
  Devonian). They analyze the sedimentology and facies geometry of the alluvial rocks,
  which contain numerous marker ash-fall tuffs. The research provides insights into
  the controls on alluvial architecture, including intrinsic and extrinsic factors,
  and helps to understand the development of calcretes and shifting activities of
  mixed tidal and river channels in the area.
