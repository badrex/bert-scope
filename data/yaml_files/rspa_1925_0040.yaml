tldr: The authors analyze the results of Bucherer's experiment, which aimed to determine
  the velocity of electrons using electric and magnetic fields. They discuss the limitations
  of the experiment and propose a method to improve the accuracy of the results. The
  study is relevant to understanding the behavior of electrons and the development
  of particle accelerators.
