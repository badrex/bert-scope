tldr: This study examines the Monograptid species with non-overlapping triangular
  thecae, focusing on a collection from the Lower Llandovery rocks of the Rheidol
  Gorge. The author discusses the types of preservation, the changes in thecae on
  compression, and the sequence of forms in the succession. Three new species and
  six varieties are identified, and the author provides critical synonymies, diagnoses,
  and descriptions of the species.
