tldr: The symposium discusses the concept of continental drift and how the underlying
  convection currents may be related to the movement of continents. It explores the
  idea that the horizontal displacement of continents may be linked to the lengthening
  of active orogenic zones and the prevalence of strike-slip faults. The authors also
  touch upon the importance of palaeomagnetic studies and the behavior of the Earth's
  crust through geological time.
