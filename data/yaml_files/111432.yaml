tldr: This article discusses the hourly observations of magnetic declination made
  by Captain Rochfort Maguire and the officers of H.M.S. Plover at Point Barrow, on
  the shores of the Polar Sea, from 1852 to 1854. The observations were conducted
  using an ice observatory and involved recording the magnetic declination and auroral
  phenomena. The author, Edward Sabine, found that the disturbances in magnetic declination
  followed systematic laws and that there was a striking correspondence between the
  disturbance laws at Point Barrow and Toronto. The article also highlights the high
  frequency of auroral manifestations at Point Barrow and their correlation with the
  westerly disturbance-deflections.
