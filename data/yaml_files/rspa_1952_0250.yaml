tldr: The authors investigated the frictional properties of various linear polymers
  and found that the frictional force is proportional to the area of contact. They
  discovered that strong adhesion occurs between the surfaces, and shearing occurs
  within the bulk of the plastic rather than at the interface. This suggests that
  the mechanism of friction for plastics is similar to that proposed for metals. An
  exception to these findings is polytetrafluorethylene, which has a different frictional
  behavior.
