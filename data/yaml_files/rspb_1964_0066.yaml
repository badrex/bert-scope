revised_title: Exploring the Role of Calcium in Muscular Contraction
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology

tldr: The author discusses the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction,
  focusing on the role of calcium in the contraction of Maia muscle fibers. They investigate
  the effects of calcium buffers, such as EGTA, and the relationship between calcium
  concentration and muscle contraction. The study provides evidence for the importance
  of calcium in muscle contraction and relaxation processes.
