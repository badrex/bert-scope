tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by B.C. Brodie on the effects of
  various poisons, such as arsenic, muriate of barytes, emetic tartar, and corrosive
  sublimate, on the animal system. Brodie examines the symptoms and actions of these
  poisons on different animals and infers that they primarily affect the brain, heart,
  and stomach. He also explores the role of local application and inflammation in
  the effects of these poisons.
