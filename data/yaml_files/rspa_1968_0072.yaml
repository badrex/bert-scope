tldr: This study investigates the viscoelastic relaxation spectra of lubricating oils
  and their component fractions. The authors found that the relaxation spectrum cannot
  be solely interpreted in terms of hydrocarbon type analysis, indicating that other
  unknown characteristics have a significant influence. A new mechanical model for
  viscoelasticity is proposed, which fits the experimental results for the oils and
  their fractions over a wide range of frequencies.
