tldr: The study investigates the transmission of anti-Brucella abortus agglutinins
  across the gut in young rats. The results show that only y2-complete agglutinins
  were transmitted, while y1M and y2-complete agglutinins in the immune sera did not
  correlate with the titers of the sera administered. The gut exhibited selection
  between y2-agglutinins from individual rabbits, and the incomplete antibodies appearing
  in the sera of fed rats partially reverted to the complete type on gel filtration
  and osmotic concentration. This research helps understand the transmission and immune
  response to Brucella abortus in young rats.
