tldr: The author, Wm. Watson, conducted experiments to further understand the nature
  and properties of electricity. He discovered that electricity can counteract and
  overcome the force of gravity, and that it has some properties in common with magnetism
  and light. Watson also observed the differences in the appearance and behavior of
  electrical fire from different substances and discussed the penetration of electrical
  power through various materials.
