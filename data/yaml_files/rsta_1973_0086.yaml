tldr: This article discusses the development of superconducting reciprocating machines,
  which offer advantages over traditional rotating machines. The design consists of
  an armature that reciprocates in a uniform magnetic field produced by a stationary
  superconducting solenoid. The main challenges in the design of these machines include
  mechanical issues, such as bearings and fatigue, and electrical issues, like low
  reactance. The article explores the potential benefits and possible solutions to
  overcome these challenges.
