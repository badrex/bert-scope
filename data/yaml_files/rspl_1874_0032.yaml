tldr: The author examines the structure and development of Myriothela, a type of marine
  hydroid, and identifies two distinct layers in its ectoderm. The deeper layer, called
  the claviform tissue, is believed to represent a nervous system, while the superficial
  layer is considered an epidermis. The author also describes the unique structure
  of the tentacles and the presence of a sensory apparatus, which may be an early
  stage of sight and touch differentiation. Additionally, the paper discusses the
  reproductive process of Myriothela, including the formation of ova, fecundation,
  and the development of a planula embryo.
