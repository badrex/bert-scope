tldr: The authors, G. B. Buckton and A. W. Hofmann, studied the reaction of sulphuric
  acid with nitriles and amides. They discovered a new acid, methylo-tetra-sulphuric
  acid, formed by the reaction of acetonitrile with fuming sulphuric acid. This acid
  is stable and can be obtained from other compounds like acetamide. The reaction
  demonstrates the transformation of the acetic molecule under the influence of acids
  and bases.
