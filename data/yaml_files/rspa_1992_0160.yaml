tldr: This article investigates the effects of uniform suction on the stability of
  flow on a rotating disc. The author finds that suction has a stabilizing effect
  on the flow, while blowing is destabilizing. The study also shows that suction increases
  the critical Reynolds number associated with stationary modes of disturbance and
  the number of spiral vortices that precede turbulent flow.
