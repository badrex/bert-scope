tldr: The article investigates the effects of eserine-like compounds on frog nerve-muscle
  preparations and the conditions in which a single shock can evoke an augmented muscular
  response. The experiments show that these compounds can cause muscles of cold preparations
  to respond repetitively to a single nerve volley, while warm preparations show no
  such response. The study also examines the effects of calcium-deficient solutions
  and prostigmine on the responses of frog nerve-muscle preparations.
