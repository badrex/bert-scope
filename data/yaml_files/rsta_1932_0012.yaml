tldr: The author investigates the formation of dust ridges in a vibrating gas and
  proposes a new explanation based on vortex motion. They demonstrate that previous
  theories, which relied on repulsive forces between particles, fail to account for
  the observed phenomena. The author's experiments show that the formation of dust
  ridges is due to the interaction of vortex motion and the general circulation between
  antinode and node, providing a more accurate understanding of the behavior of dust
  particles in a vibrating gas.
