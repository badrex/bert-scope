tldr: The authors measured the diamagnetic anisotropies of various organic molecules,
  including aromatic and aliphatic compounds, and determined the principal molecular
  susceptibilities. The study found that the molecular anisotropy is related to the
  molecular shape, constitution, and bond character. In aromatic compounds, the anisotropy
  is influenced by substitution, which generally decreases the anisotropy. This decrease
  depends on the nature and position of the substituents.
