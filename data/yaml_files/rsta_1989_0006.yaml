tldr: This article presents a case study of a quality problem in a manufacturing process
  that was solved through a dynamic problem-solving process using statistics, experimental
  design, and engineering. The team identified the root cause of the problem by conducting
  experiments and analyzing data, ultimately improving the quality and productivity
  of the process.
