tldr: This study investigates the crystalline lens's oxygen uptake and its autoxidation
  system. The researchers found that a disturbed or partially destroyed autoxidation
  system in the lens can lead to health issues. They also discovered that ultra-violet
  light and heat rays can decrease the lens's glutathione content, which may contribute
  to cataract formation.
