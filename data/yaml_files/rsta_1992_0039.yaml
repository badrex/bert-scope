tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the energy output and detonation
  products of insensitive high explosives, such as trinitrotoluene/nitroguanidine
  and polymer bonded explosive charges, under different argon pressures. They found
  that the detonation products were highly dependent on the ambient pressure of argon,
  with significant changes occurring between vacuum and atmospheric pressure. The
  results showed that argon behaves as a confining medium, influencing the reaction
  products and energy output of the explosives.
