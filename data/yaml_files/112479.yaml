tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, discovered a new class of bodies isomorphic to hydrocyanic
  acid, specifically focusing on cyanide of phenyl. This compound is formed by reacting
  aniline with cyanide and has unique properties, such as a blue color and a strong
  odor. The author also discusses the reactions of cyanide of phenyl with other compounds,
  such as acids and silver cyanide.
