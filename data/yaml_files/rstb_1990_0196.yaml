tldr: This article explores the interplay between population dynamics, ecological
  processes, and genetic diversification. It discusses how population fluctuations
  affect genetic variation and how ecological forces driven by genetic variation can
  influence the evolutionary process. The article also examines the role of extinction
  and recolonization of subpopulations in enhancing genetic variation and differentiation
  among populations.
