tldr: This article discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the Dead
  Sea rift, focusing on the shear movement along the Dead Sea rift. The authors examine
  various hypotheses and geological investigations to determine if the shear hypothesis
  is well established. They conclude that the shear movement is indeed well established,
  and the prediction that all geological features are offset by about 100 km across
  the rift is correct. The article presents a series of illustrations and maps to
  support their findings.
