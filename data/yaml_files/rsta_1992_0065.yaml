tldr: The article describes time-resolved macromolecular crystallography experiments
  on H-ras p21, a protein involved in cell signaling. The researchers used a photosensitive
  precursor of GTP (caged GTP) to study the structural changes in the protein during
  GTP hydrolysis. The results provide insights into the protein's active and resting
  states, as well as the mechanism of oncogenic transformation.
