tldr: This study examines the character of muscarinic receptors in different regions
  of the rat brain. The researchers found that while antagonist binding constants
  were similar across areas, agonist binding curves showed significant differences.
  They discovered that all regions have three classes of receptors with similar binding
  characteristics, but present in different proportions. This suggests that the diverse
  agonist binding curves for different areas can be attributed to the different abundance
  of three receptor types of essentially the same binding characteristics.
