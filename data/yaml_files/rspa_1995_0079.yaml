revised_title: Ignition and Extinction Wave Speeds in Combustion
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Combustion
semantic_tags:
- Combustion

- Wave speed
- Bifurcation diagrams
- Numerical methods
tldr: The authors study the ignition and extinction wave speeds in combustion using
  reaction-diffusion equations. They determine the wave speeds numerically for different
  parameter values and discuss the implications of their findings. The results complement
  previous work on monostable and bistable reaction functions relevant to combustion.
