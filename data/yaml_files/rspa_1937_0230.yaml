tldr: The author presents a method to calculate the torsion of conical shells, generalizing
  the Bredt-Batho formula. The solution considers the shear stress and torque, and
  the twist can be calculated without difficulty. The author also discusses the warping
  of cross-sections in cylindrical tubes and conical shells.
