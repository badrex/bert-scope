tldr: 'This article discusses four new methods for characterizing layered silicates
  and their intercalates: high-resolution solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance,
  X-ray photoelectron studies, high-resolution electron microscopy, and neutron scattering
  studies. These techniques provide insights into the structure, properties, and behavior
  of clay minerals and their intercalates with organic guests, focusing on serpentines,
  kandites, smectites, micas, vermiculites, chloritoids, zeolites, and intergrowths
  of these minerals.'
