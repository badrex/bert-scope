tldr: The dehydration of chrome alum crystals was studied to understand the processes
  occurring at the interface between the reactant and product solid phases. The researchers
  observed the formation of two types of nuclei, their growth rates, and the effects
  of temperature and water vapor on the dehydration process. The dehydration of chrome
  alum forms a case intermediate between copper sulfate pentahydrate and manganous
  oxalate bihydrate.
