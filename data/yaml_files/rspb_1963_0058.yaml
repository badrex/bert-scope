tldr: The author examines the differentiation of synaptic areas in neuromuscular junctions,
  focusing on the properties of the striated muscle fiber at the neuromuscular junction.
  They discuss the high concentration of cholinesterase activity, the presence of
  muscle nuclei, and the sensitivity to drugs like acetylcholine. The study provides
  insights into the specialized areas of muscle fibers and their function in the transmission
  mechanism.
