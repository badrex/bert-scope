tldr: The authors study the correlation between amino acid sequence and axial structure
  in collagen using X-ray diffraction, electron microscopy, and amino acid sequence
  analysis. They construct a model for the native tendon pattern and reveal the role
  of teleopeptides in the structure. The findings provide a detailed understanding
  of the structure of tendon and its relation to the fibrous long spacing structure.
