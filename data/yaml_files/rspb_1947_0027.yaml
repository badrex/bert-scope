tldr: The article investigates the process of phenolic hardening in the newly formed
  cuticle of Crustacea Decapoda. It examines the chemical composition and structure
  of the cuticle, revealing that while calcification is the primary cause of hardening,
  phenolic tanning also occurs. The study establishes a clear homology between the
  crustacean and insect cuticles and suggests that the changes in the new cuticle
  limit its permeability.
