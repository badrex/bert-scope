tldr: The author investigates the distribution of configuration and velocity in the
  vortex atom theory of gases, a kinetic theory that differs from the ordinary solid
  particle theory by allowing for varying radii and velocities of vortex rings. The
  author compares this theory to Maxwell's demon and the role of a porous plate in
  the distribution of gas molecules.
