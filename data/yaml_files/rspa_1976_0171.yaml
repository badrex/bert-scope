tldr: The authors investigate the steady flow of a viscous fluid under a constant
  pressure gradient in a curved tube with a uniform triangular cross-section. They
  provide numerical solutions for the range 100-12000 of the Dean number and examine
  the development of a boundary-layer structure as the Dean number increases. The
  results show some agreement with an asymptotic model proposed by Smith (1976) but
  also reveal discrepancies in the precise details.
