tldr: This article examines the influence of Samuel Hartlib on the early history of
  the Royal Society. It critically evaluates the connections between the Comenian
  group, the founders of the Royal Society, and Mersenne's group. The author argues
  that while Hartlib was involved in various scientific schemes and had connections
  with key figures, there is no direct evidence that he played a significant role
  in the foundation of the Royal Society.
