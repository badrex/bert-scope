tldr: The author conducted experiments on the torpedo fish to study its electrical
  properties. They discovered that the fish's electricity can magnetize a needle and
  move it in a spiral wire and a multiplier. The fish's electricity can also pass
  through air and produce luminous sparks, but it does not affect the common electrometer.
  The author also found that the fish can act as a chemical agent, evolving gas and
  affecting solutions of salt and nitrate of silver.
