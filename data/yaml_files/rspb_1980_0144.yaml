tldr: The authors studied the integration of viral DNA sequences in cells transformed
  by adenovirus 2 or SV40. They found that the integrated viral sequences can have
  complex arrangements, with tracts of the viral genome being inverted with respect
  to each other. The authors also determined the nucleotide sequences at the junctions
  between cellular and viral DNAs, finding an abrupt transition and no evidence of
  homology between flanking sequences and inserted viral sequences. This research
  provides insight into the mechanism of integration and the process of transformation
  itself.
