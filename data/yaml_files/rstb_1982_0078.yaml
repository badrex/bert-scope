tldr: 'The author argues that the model-building approach to the neuropsychology of
  cognitive function should take precedence over other approaches, such as neuroanatomical
  and general-cognitive approaches. They illustrate this claim by discussing current
  psycholinguistic studies of two forms of acquired dyslexia: phonological dyslexia
  and surface dyslexia. The author uses a psycholinguistic account of normal reading
  as a theoretical framework to define and explain the patterns of deficit and preservation
  observed in these two dyslexias. This framework helps to predict the nature of surface
  dyslexia in other languages and confirms these predictions in a case of an English-Spanish
  bilingual.'
