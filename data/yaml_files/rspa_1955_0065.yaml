tldr: The author investigates the effect of acid pre-treatment on the oxidation of
  carbon. They find that treating charcoal with acids increases the ratio of carbon
  monoxide to carbon dioxide produced during combustion. The results are explained
  in terms of an electronic theory of catalysis, where electromeric effects produced
  by impurities in the carbon are thought to be transmitted through the graphite lattice.
