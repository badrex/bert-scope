tldr: This article investigates the flight mechanics of boomerangs, focusing on their
  aerodynamics and the factors that influence their curved path. The author explains
  the role of the "rounding" and "twisting" in boomerang design and describes the
  flight path, which involves a loop and a gradual descent. The article provides a
  mathematical analysis of the forces acting on the boomerang during its flight, considering
  the air resistance and the boomerang's shape.
