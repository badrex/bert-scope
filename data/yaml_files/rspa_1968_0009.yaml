tldr: The authors studied the electronic absorption spectrum of gaseous s-tetrazine
  and performed rotational analyses of the bands of six isotopic species. They determined
  the molecular structure of s-tetrazine in both the ground state and the excited
  state, finding that the molecule is not as distorted from a hexagonal conformation
  as previously thought. The study also revealed a surprisingly large change in the
  geometric structure upon electronic excitation.
