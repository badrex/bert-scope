tldr: The authors classify real Lie algebras of first-order differential operators
  and their associated modules, focusing on their application to quasi-exactly solvable
  Schrodinger operators in two-dimensional space. They provide new examples of real
  quasi-exactly solvable potentials and discuss the extension of these results to
  higher dimensions.
