tldr: The authors conducted an electron microscopic study to investigate the mode
  of termination of cortico-thalamic fibers within the sensory relay nuclei of the
  thalamus. They found that these fibers belong to the smallest group of myelinated
  axons in the nuclei and terminate outside the synaptic glomeruli. The findings indicate
  that these terminals are part of the small dark group of axon terminals, but some
  may have a subcortical origin.
