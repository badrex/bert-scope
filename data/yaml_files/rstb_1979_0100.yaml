tldr: The article discusses the concept of geochemical ecology and its relation to
  health problems. It explains how the state of health or disease is influenced by
  the nature of the organism, the properties of the biosphere, and the geochemical
  composition of the environment. The author suggests a system of biogeochemical regionalizing
  to study the ecological structure of the biosphere and the interaction of geochemical
  factors with organisms. This system helps in understanding the role of natural and
  technogenic environments in health preservation and disease prevention.
