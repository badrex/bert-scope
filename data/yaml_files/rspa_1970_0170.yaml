tldr: This article discusses the strength and stiffness of polymers, focusing on the
  role of molecular alinement and the influence of physical structure. The author
  explores the potential for enhancing the stiffness of polymers, comparing them to
  metals and analyzing the factors that affect their elastic modulus. The article
  also touches on the importance of understanding the transformation of polymer structures
  during plastic deformation and the technological processes used to create orientation
  in polymers.
