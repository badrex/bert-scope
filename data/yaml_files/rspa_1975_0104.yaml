tldr: The authors analyze and discuss the critical factors that influence the performance
  of a Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectrometer. They describe
  the design and use of a spectrometer based on their analysis, focusing on field
  homogeneity, probe design, transient circuit behavior, Johnson noise, nonlinear
  analysis, phase-sensitive detection, and signal processing. The authors also introduce
  a cyclically ordered phase sequence (CYCLOPS) to simplify quadrature Fourier transformation.
  They demonstrate the spectrometer's performance with spectra obtained from cesium
  and phosphorus resonances.
