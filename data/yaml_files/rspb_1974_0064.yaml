tldr: The study investigates the contractile properties of rat muscles and how they
  are controlled by the pattern of muscle activity. By stimulating denervated soleus
  muscles with different patterns, the researchers found that muscles stimulated at
  100 Hz acquired properties characteristic of fast muscles, while those stimulated
  at 10 Hz remained slow. This demonstrates the importance of the pattern of muscle
  activity in determining contractile properties.
