tldr: This article examines the correspondence between Faraday and Thomson regarding
  their discussions on diamagnetism. It highlights how Thomson's mathematical expertise
  combined with Faraday's experimental findings led to the development of the first
  rigorous field theory of magnetism. The author argues that Faraday's resistance
  to some of Thomson's ideas stemmed from his experimentalist's distrust of abstract
  mathematics. The article also discusses Faraday's changing attitude towards the
  role of mathematics in natural philosophy.
