revised_title: Revisiting the Interaction of Two Electrons in Quantum Electrodynamics
scientific_discipline: Physics > Quantum Mechanics
semantic_tags:
- Quantum Electrodynamics
- Relativistic Wave Equation
- Two-Electron Interactions
- Negative-Energy States
- Perturbation Theory
tldr: The authors derive a relativistic wave equation for helium-like systems using
  quantum electrodynamics, focusing on the interaction of two electrons. They address
  the issue of negative-energy states and provide a new approach to calculate energy
  levels with improved accuracy.
