tldr: The author examines the retinal structure and visual cells of the coelacanth,
  Latimeria chalumnae, using electron microscopy. They discover four types of visual
  cells, with most being rods and three types of cones. The retina's structure and
  the presence of a choroidal tapetum lucidum suggest adaptations to the dimly lit
  deep waters where the coelacanth lives. This research provides insights into the
  evolution of the vertebrate eye and its adaptations to different environments.
