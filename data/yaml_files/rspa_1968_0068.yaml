tldr: The authors investigated the flow behavior and grain growth of polycrystalline
  lead under simple shear at higher temperatures. They found that the flow properties
  of the metal change significantly at temperatures above 27Â°C, with the metal behaving
  as a non-Newtonian fluid. The study also revealed that the final average grain diameter
  of the lead is influenced by temperature, with a constant grain size being characteristic
  of the temperature. The results provide insights into the flow behavior and grain
  growth of polycrystalline lead, which is important for understanding the mechanical
  properties of metals under stress.
