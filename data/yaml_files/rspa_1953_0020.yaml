tldr: The authors investigated the infra-red absorption bands of various dimeric carboxylic
  acids and their COOD derivatives. They found that the COOH group typically has absorption
  bands in the regions of 1420, 1300, and 935 cm⁻¹, which correspond to different
  types of vibrations. The study aimed to provide a consistent interpretation of the
  characteristic frequencies of the COOH group in dimeric hydrogen-bonded states.
