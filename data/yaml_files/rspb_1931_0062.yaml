tldr: The authors studied the molecular statistics of enzyme action, specifically
  focusing on catalase, an enzyme found in living cells. They found that a large proportion
  of catalase molecules are active at any given moment, leading to a low temperature
  coefficient. The study provides insights into enzyme kinetics and the efficiency
  of collisions in enzyme reactions.
