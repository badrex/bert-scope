tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the electrical qualities
  and chemical composition of glass and allied substances. The authors conducted experiments
  on various types of glass, focusing on flint glasses with high density. They found
  that the electrical resistance of glass increases with density and approaches a
  definite chemical composition. This research contributes to the understanding of
  the electrical properties of materials and their applications in technology.
