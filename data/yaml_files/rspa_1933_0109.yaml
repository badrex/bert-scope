tldr: This study investigates the thermal and electrical conductivities of tungsten,
  molybdenum, silver, and iron between -183°C and 100°C using an electrical method.
  The purity of the metal specimens and their sensitivity to impurities are also discussed.
  The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the conductivities of these
  metals under various temperatures and conditions.
