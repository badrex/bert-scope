tldr: The article explores the interaction between Belousov-Zhabotinsky and Fisher-Kolmogorov
  waves across a semi-permeable membrane. It examines a chemical system with two reaction
  regions coupled via a linear diffusive interchange of a chemical species. The study
  focuses on the behavior of an excitable and a non-excitable reaction mechanism,
  and the effects of coupling them together.
