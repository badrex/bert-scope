tldr: In 1761, Benedict Ferner observed the transit of Venus over the sun's disk from
  different locations using various colored glasses. He described his observations,
  the equipment used, and the difficulties encountered in measuring the exact moments
  of contact. Ferner also shared his findings on the differences in observations made
  by other astronomers and discussed the importance of precise instruments and timing
  in such observations.
