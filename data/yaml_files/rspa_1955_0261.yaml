tldr: The authors explore the matrix element of a dynamical variable between two bound
  states using the Bethe-Salpeter formalism. They demonstrate how to calculate propagators
  and matrix elements for any dynamical variable, providing a complete solution to
  quantum field theory. The method is applied to bound and scattering states, including
  incoming and outgoing composite particles.
