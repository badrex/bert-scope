tldr: The author describes the construction and operation of a universal interferometer,
  a precision instrument for measuring length and deformation. The interferometer
  uses interference patterns to accurately measure the movement of microscopes, enabling
  the observation and measurement of standards of length. The device is suitable for
  various applications, including the measurement of objects, instruments, and their
  movements or deformations.
