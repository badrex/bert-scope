tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of the straggling of beta-particles
  as they pass through thin foils. The author develops a theory based on probability
  and collision dynamics, which allows for the calculation of the straggling effect
  and the most probable loss of energy. The study focuses on the experimental results
  of White and Millingon, comparing their findings with the classical theory of Bohr.
