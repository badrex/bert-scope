tldr: The author conducted experiments with a voltaic cell using a fused electrolyte
  and gaseous depolarizer, specifically chlorine gas. They found that the depolarizing
  effect of chlorine gas was significant when the gas was allowed to bubble out and
  surround the carbon electrode, creating a more efficient cell. This research contributes
  to the understanding of electrochemical cells and their potential applications.
