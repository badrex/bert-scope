tldr: The article describes an engine invented by Joshua Haskins and improved by J.T.
  Desaguliers that uses quicksilver (mercury) to raise water without friction. The
  engine avoids the problems of traditional hydraulic engines, such as loss of water
  and increased friction, and can raise a hogshead of water to a height of 27 feet
  in less than two minutes.
