tldr: The authors studied the gas phase reactions of methylene with various organic
  halides, such as methyl chloride and ethyl chloride. They found that methylene reacts
  with these halides by abstracting a chlorine or hydrogen atom, forming radicals
  that can give rise to different products. The research aimed to establish whether
  insertion or abstraction processes predominate in these reactions. The findings
  contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the gas phase reactions
  of methylene with organic halides.
