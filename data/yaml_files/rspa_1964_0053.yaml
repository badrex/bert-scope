tldr: The authors conducted experiments using submicrosecond impulses to study the
  initial stages of a spark discharge and the light emitted from it. They measured
  the threshold voltage at which the first visible discharge occurs in a homogeneous
  field electrode gap, using various gases at different values of gap and gas pressure.
  The study included spectroscopic analysis and high-speed photography to reveal the
  characteristics of the discharges and the transition from an electron avalanche
  to a streamer or glow discharge.
