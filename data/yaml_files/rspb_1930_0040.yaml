tldr: The author investigates the state of water in muscle and blood, focusing on
  the osmotic behavior of muscle. They propose a method to determine the amount of
  "free" water in muscle and blood by comparing the depression of vapor pressure caused
  by adding soluble substances to the solution. The results show that mammalian blood
  contains about the same relative amount of water as amphibian muscle, with 80 grams
  of water per 100 grams of blood.
