tldr: This article explores the relationship between time, tense, and grammaticality
  in language processing. It discusses how the tense system of a language interacts
  with other syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic variables to determine the intended
  time of an event or state. The author claims that the default meaning of tense markers
  can be overruled by linguistic or contextual factors, and provides examples to illustrate
  these possibilities. The implications of these analyses for traditional Chomskyan
  notions of grammaticality and acceptability are also discussed.
