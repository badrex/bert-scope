tldr: The authors studied the decomposition of sodium formate by the enzyme hydrogenlyase
  in Bacterium coli in the presence of heavy water. They found that the composition
  of the hydrogen gas evolved is determined by the equilibrium between heavy and light
  hydrogen atoms in the water. This equilibrium plays a significant role in the preferential
  liberation of light hydrogen in separation methods.
