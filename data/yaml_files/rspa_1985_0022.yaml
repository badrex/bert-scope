tldr: The author investigates the optic flow field arising from motion relative to
  a visually textured plane. They show that the observer's linear and angular velocity
  and the plane's coordinate vector can be characterized by eight parameters. However,
  these parameters do not uniquely determine the vectors. The author presents three
  possible interpretations of the optic flow field, and by applying a condition that
  attributes every image element to a light source in the observer's field of view,
  they eliminate two spurious interpretations, leaving only the veridical interpretation.
  The computation of this interpretation involves solving a 3x3 eigenvalue problem
  derived from the flow field.
