tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of various
  antimony compounds in treating trypanosomiasis in rats. They found that some compounds,
  like sodium antimonyl tartrate, were effective in eliminating trypanosomes from
  the blood, but caused local irritation. Other compounds, like ethylantimonyl tartrate,
  were non-irritant and highly effective in treating the disease. The study suggests
  that future research should focus on developing non-irritant compounds that can
  remain in solution in the body's tissues and act quickly against trypanosomes.
