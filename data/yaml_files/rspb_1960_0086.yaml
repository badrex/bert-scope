tldr: This study investigates the effects of icterogenin and rehmannic acid on biliary
  excretion in rabbits. The substances cause a decrease in bile flow and the excretion
  of bilirubin, phylloerythrin, coproporphyrin, alkaline phosphatase, and bromsulphalein.
  The researchers suggest that the mechanism behind this inhibition might be related
  to a general effect on liver cell permeability rather than interference with specific
  enzyme systems.
