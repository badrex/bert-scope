tldr: The author, John Phillips, shares his observations of Jupiter's equatorial bands
  using an equatorial telescope. He describes the bands as appearing ochraceous, or
  similar to the color of some ochraceous sands, and notes that they are not as dark
  as previously thought. He also mentions that the space between the equatorial bands
  appears bright white and silvery. Phillips compares the colors of Jupiter's bands
  to the supposed "land" of Mars and notes that there is no similar tint on the moon.
