tldr: The article describes the detailed anatomy and connectivity of the pharynx in
  Caenorhabditis elegans, a nematode with a simple nervous system. The pharynx is
  a muscular pump used for feeding, and its structure and function are analyzed through
  electron micrographs of serial sections. The pharynx contains 34 muscle cells, 9
  marginal cells, 9 epithelial cells, 5 gland cells, and 20 neurons, making it a self-contained
  neuromuscular system. The study provides insights into the functioning of simple
  nervous systems.
