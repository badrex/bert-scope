tldr: This article explores the systematics of fullerenes and related carbon clusters,
  focusing on isomer generation, electronic structure, and geometric shapes. The author
  presents the ring-spiral algorithm and magic number rules to predict and count possible
  isomers and their properties. The article also discusses the stability and selection
  rules for interconversion of fullerenes and related structures, such as doped fullerenes,
  metallocarbohedrenes, and decorated-fullerene models for water clusters.
