tldr: This study investigates the development of turbulence in a long circular tube
  using a double-refraction method. The researchers employed a streaming double-refraction
  technique to examine the flow of a weak benzopurpurin solution in water. They observed
  two types of turbulent entry and found that the nature of the breakdown of laminar
  flow at a cross-section depends on the type of entry and the distance from the inlet.
  The researchers also investigated the development of complete turbulence at various
  cross-sections.
