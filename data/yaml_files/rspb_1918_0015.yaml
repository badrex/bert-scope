tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if Dr. Charlton Bastian's claims
  of synthesizing living organisms from sterilized colloidal solutions were accurate.
  After carefully repeating Bastian's experiments and taking strict precautions to
  avoid contamination, the author found no evidence of living organisms in the samples.
  The observed organized bodies were likely due to the slow deposition of silica from
  the colloidal solutions.
