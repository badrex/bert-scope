tldr: The article investigates the growth and development of the shoot apex in the
  fern species Dryopteris aristata Druce. It examines the factors that determine the
  form and structure of leaves, buds, and scales, and concludes that some classical
  views on the organization of the leafy shoot are not compatible with the available
  data. The study also explores the role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in morphological
  development and suggests that the shoot type of organization in vascular plants
  may be the result of parallel evolution.
