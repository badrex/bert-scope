tldr: The author analyzes the asymptotic structure of near-tip fields around stationary
  and steadily growing interface cracks with frictionless contact in anisotropic bimaterials.
  A complete representation of the asymptotic fields is obtained using the method
  of analytic continuation. The study considers combined in-plane and out-of-plane
  deformation and provides insights into the effect of material mismatch and crack
  propagation speed on the size of the contact zone.
