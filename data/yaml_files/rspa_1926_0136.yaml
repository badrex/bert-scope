tldr: The author investigates the forces experienced by a cylinder in a stream of
  viscous fluid, focusing on lift and drag forces. They find that the lift is given
  by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, while the drag is associated with a particular term
  in the solution that corresponds to an inward flow along the tail and an outward
  flow across a large contour. The study assumes periodic motion and provides expressions
  for the average lift and drag forces, which can be used to estimate the forces experienced
  by the cylinder.
