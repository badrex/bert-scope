tldr: The author examines the structure of muscular fibers and compares them to the
  structure of nervous fibers. They find that both consist of single rows of globules
  united by an elastic gelatinous matter, but differ in the size of the globules and
  the degree of elasticity. This discovery helps to explain the differences in elongation
  and contraction between muscles and nerves.
