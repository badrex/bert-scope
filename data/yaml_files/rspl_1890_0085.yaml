tldr: The author discusses the bridge method for measuring periodic electric currents
  and its sensitivity. They explore ways to improve sensitivity by adjusting resistance
  and inductance in the circuit, considering factors like electromagnets, condensers,
  and the number of windings. The author also compares the effects of resistance and
  inductance on the bridge's performance.
