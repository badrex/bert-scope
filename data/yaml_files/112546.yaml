tldr: This paper presents an in-depth osteological analysis of the Solitaire bird,
  Pezophaps solitaria, from Rodriguez Island. The authors compare the bones of the
  Solitaire to those of the Dodo and Didunculus, highlighting the differences and
  similarities in their skeletal structures. They also discuss the extinction of the
  Solitaire, attributing it to the introduction of feral swine on the island, which
  outcompeted and drove the Solitaire to extinction.
