tldr: The authors used radioactive tracer methods to study sputtering processes in
  metallic targets by ionic beams. They found that atoms are ejected instantaneously
  from depths of several atomic diameters, and the angular distribution of sputtered
  atoms deviates from the cosine law due to the contribution of atoms from finite
  depths within the target.
