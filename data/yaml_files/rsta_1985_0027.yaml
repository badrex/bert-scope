tldr: The article discusses the processes of organic matter decomposition, bacterial
  sulphate reduction, and pyrite formation in buried sediments. It explains how these
  processes vary in different environments, such as normal marine, euxinic, and freshwater
  sediments, and how they can be used to distinguish between these environments in
  ancient sedimentary rocks. The authors also highlight the importance of organic
  matter reactivity and burial rates in controlling the rate of sulphate reduction
  and pyrite formation.
