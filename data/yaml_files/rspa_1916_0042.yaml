tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the ionization potentials of magnesium
  and other metals, focusing on their absorption spectra. They discovered that magnesium
  vapor absorbs light at specific wavelengths, and the absorption spectrum of magnesium
  exhibits bands at X = 2852.22 A.U. and X = 2026.46 A.U. These findings contribute
  to the understanding of the behavior of metals under different conditions.
