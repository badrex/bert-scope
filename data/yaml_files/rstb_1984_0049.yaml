tldr: This study re-examines the aerodynamics of hovering insect flight using new
  data and a new theory, challenging the validity of the quasi-steady assumption.
  The authors argue that unsteady aerodynamic effects play a significant role in hovering
  flight, and they propose a generalized vortex theory to analyze the lift and power
  requirements of hovering insects.
