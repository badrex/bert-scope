tldr: The authors studied the bionomics and behavior of Convoluta Roscoffensis, a
  green Turbellarian found in Brittany. They discovered that the green cells in the
  organism are not derived from symbiosis but rather from a peculiar case of phagocytosis.
  The authors also observed the organism's tropisms, such as phototropism, geotropism,
  and thermotropism, which help it navigate its environment. The study provides insights
  into the complex relationship between the animal and its green cells.
