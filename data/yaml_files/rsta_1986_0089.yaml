tldr: This article discusses the principles and factors that govern deep groundwater
  flow, focusing on the Canadian research program for waste disposal in the Precambrian
  rocks of the Canadian Shield. The author explains how the general character of groundwater
  flow is dominated by surface topography and the decreasing hydraulic conductivity
  with depth. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the crucial
  factors to devise indirect techniques for reliable estimates of groundwater flow
  and its consequences.
