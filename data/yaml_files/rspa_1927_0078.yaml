tldr: The author investigates the relations connecting angle-sums and volume of a
  polytope in n-dimensional space, focusing on Euler's Polyhedral Theorem. They explore
  different types of angles and their measures, and derive equations connecting the
  volume and angle-sums of a simplex and a polytope. This work extends the understanding
  of angle-sums and volume in various dimensions and geometries.
