tldr: The author investigates the relationship between differential equations and
  algebraic equations, specifically focusing on the differential equations that determine
  the form of the roots of algebraic equations. They explore the generalization of
  a particular type of differential equation and its connection to a large class of
  differential equations. The author also solves the general differential equation
  by definite integrals and determines the arbitrary constants of the solution.
