tldr: This article presents the oscillator strengths of 148 transitions in the neutral
  chromium atom with wavelengths between 200 and 541 nm. The authors used the hook
  and absorption methods to determine these strengths for strong and weak lines, respectively.
  The results provide a consistent set of oscillator strengths that can be used to
  check stellar atmosphere models and adjust model parameters for consistency.
