tldr: The author, James Glaisher, analyzed meteorological data from various stations
  in England during the years 1847-1849. He combined the published results to deduce
  mean values and formulae for testing the accuracy of meteorological observations.
  Glaisher found that the instruments were generally good and observations were made
  carefully, with a few exceptions. He also discovered that the temperature of the
  dew-point was almost the same at all places at similar elevations, indicating a
  similar amount of water in the atmosphere. This study helped in understanding the
  weather patterns in England and the reliability of meteorological observations.
