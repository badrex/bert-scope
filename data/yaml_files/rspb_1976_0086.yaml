tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the changes in target cell susceptibility
  during the cell cycle in T cell mediated cytotoxicity. They found that mastocytoma
  P815 shows higher susceptibility to specific anti-H2d cytotoxic T cells during the
  early phases of the cell cycle. The changes in H2d antigen density and susceptibility
  to T cells vary independently. Meth A, a methylcholanthrene-induced tumor, shows
  no changes in susceptibility to T cell cytotoxicity during the cell cycle. These
  findings suggest that the greater susceptibility to T cell cytotoxicity during the
  G1 phase is not a trivial consequence of increased sensitivity or directly related
  to changes in antigen density.
