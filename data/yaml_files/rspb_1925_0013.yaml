tldr: This article describes the central and reflex regulation of circulation using
  crossed circulation experiments. The authors developed a technique that allows them
  to study vasomotor effects and differentiate between central and reflex-originated
  responses. They found that the crossed circulation method maintains the animal's
  circulatory system in a normal state while providing full control to the experimenter.
  This technique helps in understanding the regulation of blood pressure and blood
  flow in response to different stimuli.
