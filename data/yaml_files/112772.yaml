tldr: The author used the sphygmograph to study the radial artery pulse trace and
  discovered that the duration of the first part of the trace, which marks the beginning
  of the heart's systole, is almost constant regardless of heart rate. The study also
  found that the second part of the trace, which represents the closure of the aortic
  valve, varies with heart rate. This research helps in diagnosing circulatory system
  issues and understanding cardiac physiology.
