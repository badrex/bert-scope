tldr: This article explores the role of group theory in general relativity, specifically
  focusing on the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group. It explains how studying the asymptotic
  symmetry group can provide insights into the energy, momentum, and angular momentum
  structure of curved space-times. The author argues that group theory is essential
  in understanding the covariance principles, highly symmetric solutions, and quantum
  field theory in curved backgrounds.
