  Nitrate Ions'

tldr: The authors studied the photosensitivity of the gecko's visual pigment and its
  response to chloride and nitrate ions. They found that chloride ions increased the
  photosensitivity, while nitrate ions reduced it. The study also revealed that chloride
  and nitrate ions act at different sites and produce unique conformational changes
  in the protein molecule.
