tldr: The author presents a new machine invented by Mr. Samuel Jenkins for grinding
  lenses spherically. The machine allows for more accurate spherical lens production,
  which can be attributed to its unique design that turns a sphere on two axes simultaneously.
  This innovation promises to improve lens grinding efficiency and accuracy, benefiting
  both lens manufacturers and users who can now rely on the true sphericity of their
  lenses.
