tldr: The authors conducted experiments with xenon gas to study the Stark effect and
  its impact on the spectra. They discovered that xenon provides an excellent medium
  for understanding the true origin of Stark displacements and revealed new features
  concerning the nature of Stark patterns. The study also found that the complexity
  of the patterns in xenon spectra is greater than in helium and neon, providing a
  test for any hypothesis regarding the origin of Stark patterns.
