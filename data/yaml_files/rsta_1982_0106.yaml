tldr: This article discusses the concept of grand unified theories (GUTs) in cosmology
  and their potential applications. It explores how GUTs can explain the baryon-antibaryon
  asymmetry in the universe and the possibility of neutrinos having large enough masses
  to influence galaxy formation. The article also touches upon the unification of
  weak and electromagnetic interactions and the development of coupling strengths
  in GUTs.
