tldr: This article examines the evidence for Pfr being the active form of phytochrome,
  particularly in light-grown plants. It discusses the correlations between phytochrome
  levels and physiological responses, as well as the different types of relations
  observed between Pfr concentration and response. The author highlights the high
  sensitivity to changes in Pfr at low levels and the variety of relations between
  Pfr and response, suggesting that the concept of Pfr as the only active form of
  phytochrome may need reevaluation.
