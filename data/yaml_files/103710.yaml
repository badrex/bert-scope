tldr: Charles Price's letter describes his observations on the villi of the oxen's
  stomach and the expansion of the cuticle through the ductus alimentalis. He found
  that the villi in oxen are much larger than in humans, allowing for a detailed examination
  of their structure. He also observed that the internal surface of the oxen's stomach
  is covered by a production of the cuticle, which he believes is also present in
  humans. Price sent a piece of the oxen's stomach with filled vessels and raised
  cuticle to support his findings.
