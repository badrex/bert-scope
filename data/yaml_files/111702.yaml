tldr: The author, Maxwell Simpson, conducted experiments to synthesize succinic acid
  from cyanide of ethylene and glycol. He found that bromide of ethylene, derived
  from diatomic alcohol (glycol), could be treated with cyanide of potassium to form
  cyanide of ethylene. This process allowed the production of succinic acid, similar
  to how propionic acid is derived from ordinary alcohol. Simpson plans to further
  investigate this method with other hydrocarbons in the CnHn series.
