tldr: Samuel Hunter Christie discusses the magnetic observations made by Captain Back
  during his Arctic expedition. The author describes a series of experiments to determine
  the corrections needed for temperature differences and compares the results with
  a formula derived from the hypothesis of two magnetic poles near the Earth's center.
  The author praises Captain Back's dedication to scientific exploration in challenging
  conditions.
