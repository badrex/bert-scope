tldr: This article discusses the mechanisms of glycolytic enzymes, specifically aldolase,
  isomerases, and pyruvate kinase. The author synthesizes intermediates that are rapidly
  utilized by these enzymes, and observes that they follow a stepwise proton transfer
  mechanism. The author also explores the structural homology and evolution of these
  enzymes, and their ability to efficiently use enol or eneamine intermediates.
