tldr: The author examines the use of anomalous dispersion in determining phase angles
  for crystal structures, specifically in the case of cobyric acid. They compare different
  methods of phase determination and discuss the advantages and limitations of each.
  The study confirms that the anomalous synthesis provides the best approximation
  for structure solution in this case.
