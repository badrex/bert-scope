tldr: This article explores the muscular forces involved in the process of childbirth,
  specifically focusing on the role of the uterus and abdominal muscles. The author
  calculates the pressure produced by uterine contractions and abdominal muscle tension,
  determining that these forces are sufficient to complete the first stage of labor
  and expel the fetus during the second stage. The study provides valuable insights
  into the mechanics of childbirth and the role of various muscles in the process.
