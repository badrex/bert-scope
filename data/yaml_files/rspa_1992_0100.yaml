tldr: This article presents a simple mathematical model for urban growth and spread,
  incorporating local growth, diffusion, and an inhibitory effect of congested central
  areas. The model uses a reaction-diffusion equation and takes into account factors
  such as local density growth, population spread, and the negative impact of high-density
  inner cores on settlement. The authors discuss the steady-state solutions and the
  potential for future applications in city planning and understanding urban dynamics.
