tldr: The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, explores the dynamical theory of gases and their
  properties, including viscosity and the modulus of the time of relaxation. He discusses
  the relationship between temperature, density, and viscosity, and presents experimental
  results on the transpiration of gases and the viscosity of air. Maxwell's work contributes
  to the understanding of gas behavior and the development of theories in physics.
