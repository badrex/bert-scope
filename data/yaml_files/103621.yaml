tldr: The author observed the behavior of vipers and their interactions with prey,
  particularly pregnant female vipers. They discovered that only impregnated female
  vipers would feed when confined. The author also tested the effects of viper bites
  on pigs and found that giving emetic tartar to the victims could save their lives.
  This treatment was also effective in treating dogs bitten by vipers.
