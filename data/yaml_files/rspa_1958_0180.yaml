tldr: This article improves upon previous theories of the -transition in liquid helium
  by introducing a more accurate method for calculating the effective mass of atoms
  in permutations. The revised approach shows that two-sided polygons contribute practically
  nothing near the transition temperature, leading to a better understanding of the
  specific heat and the -transition in liquid helium.
