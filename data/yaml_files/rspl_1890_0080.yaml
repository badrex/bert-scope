tldr: The author discusses the fossil plant Bowmanites found in the Coal-Measures,
  focusing on its unique fructification and reproductive organs. The plant has a distinct
  stem with articulated nodes, each bearing a verticil of lateral appendages. The
  fructification consists of a circular disk with disk-rays, which are not identified
  as true leaves. The plant's reproductive organs, including sporangiophores and sporangia,
  have distinctive features that set it apart from other Calamariae. This study provides
  a more complete understanding of the plant's history and classification.
