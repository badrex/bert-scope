tldr: This article presents a detailed thermodynamic analysis of the Volta effect
  for systems with adsorbed films or spread monolayers. The authors derive a fundamental
  equation and obtain Maxwell relations describing the impact of an applied electric
  field on the parameters characterizing surface films. They also discuss the limitations
  of the Bridgman, Kelvin, and Lorentz (B.K.L.) assumptions and propose new experiments
  to explore the effects of these assumptions on two-dimensional phase changes.
