tldr: The author introduces a new method for testing collinearity in shape spaces
  using geodesic distances and the singular-values decomposition of matrices. This
  method can be used to analyze near-collinearity in various applications, providing
  a more accurate assessment of one-dimensional deficiencies in data sets.
