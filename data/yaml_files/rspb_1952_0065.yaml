tldr: The study investigates the factors affecting colony formation by bacteria in
  the presence of antibacterial agents. The authors found that factors such as drug
  concentration, inoculum size, and the interaction between the solid medium and bacteria
  play a significant role in colony formation. The results suggest that the production
  of resistant colonies is not solely due to the presence of specific mutants and
  that other factors, such as diffusible substances and the colloidal properties of
  the medium, can influence colony formation.
