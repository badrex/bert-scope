tldr: The authors investigated the diffusion and relaxation of negative ion vacancies
  in potassium chloride. They found that the rate of relaxation is independent of
  the size and shape of the specimen, suggesting that the annihilation surfaces are
  part of a submicroscopic structure. The temperature and time dependence of the relaxation
  allowed them to evaluate the diffusion coefficient for negative ion vacancies, their
  energy of migration, and the order of the dimensions of the mosaic blocks.
