tldr: The article presents an exact analysis of the geometry and kinematics of Wildhaber-Novikov
  (W-N) circular arc gears, which offer higher load-carrying capacity and lower frictional
  losses compared to conventional involute gears. The theory provides essential geometrical
  and kinematic data for analyzing contact stresses and elastohydrodynamic lubrication
  in these gears.
