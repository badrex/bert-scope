tldr: The study investigates the Edinger-Westphal nucleus in the filefish and its
  role in visual accommodation. The researchers found that the nucleus is responsible
  for controlling the intraocular lens muscle, which helps in adjusting the lens for
  better focus. They also discovered that the nucleus is connected to the ciliary
  ganglion and the nucleus of the posterior commissure, forming a central pathway
  for visual accommodation in teleosts.
