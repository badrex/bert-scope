tldr: The authors analyze 19 years of hourly tide readings from Honolulu and Newlyn
  without astronomical prejudice, allowing for background noise. They propose a new
  method of tidal prediction that differs from the classical harmonic method, leading
  to slightly greater precision with fewer tidal constants. This new approach can
  better account for the continuum, non-gravitational tides, and nonlinear interactions
  in tide records.
