tldr: In this case study, Dr. Edward Tyson examines the body of Mr. Smith, who had
  a rare bladder condition. The bladder contained numerous cysts filled with a clear
  fluid, which were preventing the normal flow of urine. The kidneys were also emaciated,
  and the liver was enlarged and hard. These findings provide valuable insights into
  the functioning of the urinary system and the potential causes of such abnormalities.
