  of endemic species due to its large land area and diverse habitats. The flora consists
  of 166 indigenous species, which can be grouped into eight geographical categories
  and divided into coastal and inland species. The analysis of the flora reveals that
  Aldabra can support a large number of species and has a high percentage of endemism,
  making it an exceptional case among isolated coral islands.
