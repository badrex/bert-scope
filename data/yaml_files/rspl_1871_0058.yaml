tldr: This article investigates the connection between coal mine explosions and meteorological
  conditions, specifically focusing on barometric pressure and temperature. The authors
  analyze data from various coal mining districts and meteorological records to understand
  the factors contributing to explosions in coal mines. They find that the number
  of fatal accidents has decreased over time, but the number of serious accidents
  involving multiple fatalities has increased. The authors emphasize the importance
  of understanding these connections to improve coal mine safety.
