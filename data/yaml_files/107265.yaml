tldr: William Hyde Wollaston invents a reflective goniometer to improve the accuracy
  of measuring crystal angles. The instrument uses reflected light as the radius of
  contact, allowing for more precise measurements, especially with small crystals.
  This innovation helps in identifying minerals based on their external forms and
  angular dimensions.
