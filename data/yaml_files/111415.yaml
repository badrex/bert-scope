tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of magnetization on the
  electric conductivity of nickel and iron. They discovered that when iron and nickel
  are subjected to magnetic force, their resistance to electric conduction changes.
  The resistance of nickel decreases when magnetized transversely and increases when
  magnetized longitudinally, while the resistance of iron decreases when magnetized
  longitudinally and increases when magnetized transversely. These findings contribute
  to the understanding of the relationship between magnetism and conductivity in materials.
