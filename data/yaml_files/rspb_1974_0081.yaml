tldr: The authors conducted experiments on isolated mouse liver segments to study
  the electrogentic properties of the sodium pump. They found that the sodium-potassium
  pump in liver cells is electrogenic, contributing to the membrane potential and
  playing a significant role in potassium uptake. The presence of Strophanthin-G,
  a sodium-potassium pump inhibitor, confirmed the electrogenic nature of the pump.
