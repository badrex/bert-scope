tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the mean lifetime of the neutral
  meson by observing direct electron pairs associated with nuclear disintegrations
  and an alternative mode of decay. They found that the ratio of the probability of
  this alternative mode of decay to the transformation into two photons is 1. This
  discovery provided strong evidence for the mode of origin of the mesons and allowed
  for a direct method to determine their lifetime.
