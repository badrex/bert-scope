tldr: This report discusses the process of levelling from the Mediterranean to the
  Dead Sea, including the selected route, bench marks, and findings. The Dead Sea's
  level was found to be 1292 feet below the level of the Mediterranean, with a maximum
  depression of 1300 feet. The survey was conducted by two independent observers,
  ensuring absolute accuracy within 3 or 4 inches. The established chain of levels
  is crucial for future investigations and surveys in Palestine, particularly in archaeology,
  topography, geology, and physical geography.
