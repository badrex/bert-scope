tldr: The authors investigate the influence of the state in solution on the absorption
  spectra of dissolved dyes, particularly isocyanine dyes. They find that the absorption
  spectrum changes depending on the state of aggregation, which can be influenced
  by factors such as the solvent, temperature, and the presence of electrolytes. The
  study also highlights the importance of considering the state of aggregation when
  analyzing color changes in dyes.
