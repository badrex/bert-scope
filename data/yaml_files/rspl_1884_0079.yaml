revised_title: On Underground Temperatures and the Conductivity of Rocks
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology
semantic_tags:
- Geothermal gradient
- Rock conductivity
- Coal mining
- Mine ventilation
- Geological temperature
tldr: The author investigates underground temperatures and the conductivity of rocks,
  focusing on coal mines and mineral mines. They discuss the effects of ventilation,
  convection currents, and the influence of water on underground temperatures. The
  author also examines the differences in thermal conditions between coal and mineral
  mines, and provides a mean gradient for coal strata.
