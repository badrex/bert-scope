tldr: The authors analyze the orbits of Sputnik 2 and 3, discussing irregularities
  in air density, changes in orbital inclination, and the earth's gravitational field.
  They explore the causes of these variations, including changes in effective atmospheric
  density, rotation of the atmosphere, and the earth's non-spherically symmetrical
  gravitational field. The study provides insights into the patterns of air density
  and the potential for future satellite analysis.
