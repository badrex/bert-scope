tldr: The author examines the organization and function of the basal lobes in the
  squid Loligo, focusing on the higher motor centres and their role in controlling
  movement. The basal lobes are compared to the vertebrate cerebellum and are found
  to have similarities in their structure and function. The study provides insights
  into the decision-making and motor activities in cephalopods, contributing to a
  better understanding of their nervous system.
