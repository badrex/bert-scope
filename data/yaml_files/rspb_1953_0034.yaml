tldr: This study investigates how factors such as temperature, oxygen levels, and
  carbon dioxide affect haemoglobin synthesis in Daphnia. Researchers found that higher
  temperatures lead to increased haemoglobin synthesis, likely due to a higher metabolic
  rate and lower oxygen affinity of haemoglobin at higher temperatures. Carbon dioxide
  does not have a significant impact on haemoglobin production. Duck faeces and iron
  salts can also increase haemoglobin synthesis in water with low oxygen content.
