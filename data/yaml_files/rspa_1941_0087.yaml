tldr: The author presents an extension of Mayer's theory of condensation to derive
  equations for vapour pressure and condensation volume in gaseous and condensed phases.
  They also discuss the expansion of the partition function for the condensed phase
  and propose a method to calculate the condensation volume and vapour pressure using
  lower cluster integrals and the free energy of the condensed phase. This work provides
  a theoretical framework for understanding phase changes and pressure in gases and
  condensed materials.
