tldr: The authors investigate the characteristics of a Karman vortex street in a channel
  of finite breadth. They find that the channel walls have little effect on the vortex
  street's stability and that the drag coefficient of the body depends mainly on the
  spacing of the vortices. The study provides a better understanding of fluid dynamics
  and vortex street behavior in confined spaces.
