tldr: This article explores the formation of microstructure in polymer blends, focusing
  on the effects of molecular, rheological, and thermodynamic parameters on phase
  diagrams. It discusses the basis of miscibility in binary polymer blends and the
  kinetics of phase separation processes. The authors provide examples of specific
  polymer blends and their resulting morphologies, highlighting the importance of
  understanding and manipulating these parameters to achieve desirable material properties.
