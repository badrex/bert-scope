tldr: The authors examine the spectra of atomic flames, which are flames supported
  by free atoms obtained from discharges through oxygen or hydrogen at low pressure.
  They study the differences between atomic flames and normal flames, focusing on
  the formation and excitation of active species like CH and OH, and the high electronic
  excitation of iron atoms in certain flames. The authors also investigate the effect
  of water vapor on the atomic flames and compare the spectra of flames using heavy
  water (D20) in the discharge tube.
