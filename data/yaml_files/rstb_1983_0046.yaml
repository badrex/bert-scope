  Kinase Nil with RNA Polymerase I'

tldr: The authors investigated the activity of RNA polymerases in rat liver and Morris
  hepatoma 3924A cells, finding that RNA polymerase I had a higher activity in the
  rapidly growing tumor cells. They discovered that protein kinase Nil, which is associated
  with RNA polymerase I, plays a role in activating and phosphorylating the enzyme.
  This regulation may control the rate of ribosomal RNA synthesis in the cell.
