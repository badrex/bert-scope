tldr: Dr. Halley observed the lunar eclipse of June 18, 1722, and used his micrometer
  to measure the parts of the Moon affected by the eclipse. He determined the longitude
  of Port Royal in Jamaica based on the eclipse observations. The eclipse began at
  12:59:55 and ended around 15:27 minutes. This observation helped improve the accuracy
  of timekeeping and astronomical measurements.
