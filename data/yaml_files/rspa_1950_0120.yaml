tldr: This study investigates the phenomenon of surf beats, which are long sea waves
  with periods of 1 to 5 minutes, caused by groups of waves breaking on the shore.
  The research finds that the amplitude of these long waves is approximately proportional
  to the amplitude of ordinary waves and independent of their period. The mechanism
  behind their formation is discussed, and it is suggested that they are produced
  by the sharp increase in shoreward transport of water in or near the breaking zone.
