tldr: The authors studied the electronic and infrared absorption spectra of single
  crystals of all-trans β-carotene, a molecule with semiconducting properties. They
  measured the dark conductivity and photoconductivity excitation spectra, finding
  a weak peak at 25,000 cm^-1 and a stronger peak at 13,300 cm^-1. The study provides
  a foundation for understanding the potential functions of β-carotene in biological
  situations.
