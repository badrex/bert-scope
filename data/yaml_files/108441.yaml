tldr: The author examines a dorsal dermal spine of the Hylaeosaurus, a type of dinosaur,
  recently discovered in Tilgate Forest. They analyze the structure and internal composition
  of the spine, confirming that it is part of the dermal system. This discovery demonstrates
  a similar exaggerated development in dermal appendages in both extinct and living
  reptiles, with the difference being the ossification of the ligamentous fibers in
  the corium in the fossil reptiles.
