tldr: A systematic study was conducted on the collapse of displacement cascades in
  the Cu3Au alloy using transmission electron microscopy. The research focused on
  factors affecting the collapse of displacement cascades at different irradiation
  temperatures. The findings showed that collapse occurred with a high probability
  at both low and room temperatures, with an increase in collapse probability observed
  with ion mass. The results provide insights into the understanding of vacancy motion
  within cascades and their impact on the evolution of the damage structure.
