tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the specific heat of paramagnetic cupric
  salts and found that a part of the specific heat is independent of the degree of
  dilution. They identified this part as the nuclear specific heat due to nuclear-electronic
  interaction within the atom. The results are in agreement with observations of the
  hyperfine structure in dilute copper salts made from paramagnetic resonance experiments.
