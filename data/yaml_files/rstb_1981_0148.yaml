tldr: This article investigates the components of the mental lexicon and their interrelations,
  focusing on the functional independence of non-linguistic cognitive representations
  and word-specific lexical codes in phonological and orthographic forms. The authors
  analyze language performance in brain-damaged patients to understand how different
  aspects of language are processed and how they communicate with each other. The
  study concludes that there is a modular organization of the nervous system, with
  distinct channels of communication between independent components of the mental
  lexicon.
