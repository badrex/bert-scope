tldr: The author proposes an alternative explanation for osmotic effects, suggesting
  that the primary osmotic effect is exercised by the solvent, not the solute. They
  argue that the behavior of molecules in solution is influenced by the attractive
  forces between solute and solvent molecules, and that electrolytes have an excessive
  influence due to their additional attractive effect on water molecules. This explanation
  accounts for the constancy of molecular behavior in solutions and the differences
  in osmotic efficiency of various substances.
