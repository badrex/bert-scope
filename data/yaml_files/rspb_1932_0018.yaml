tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism of nerve control
  in carbohydrate metabolism. They found that after adrenalectomy, decerebration led
  to a decrease in liver glycogen and a rise in blood sugar levels. This suggests
  that the diabetogenic impulses set up by decerebration may act on the liver and
  muscle glycogen after adrenalectomy. The presence of the adrenal gland seems to
  be necessary for maintaining the functional integrity of the glycogenolytic nerve
  fibers.
