tldr: The author, Charles Hutton, conducted a survey at Schehallien to determine the
  mean density of the Earth. He used base measurements and various angles to calculate
  the Earth's density. Hutton's methods involved measuring the base RB in Glenmore
  and the base ~ in Rannoch, and then calculating the lengths of other lines in the
  survey using the measured bases and observed angles. This research provided a more
  accurate method for calculating the Earth's density and understanding the importance
  of precise measurements in surveying.
