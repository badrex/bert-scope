tldr: The authors analyze the primary cosmic-ray spectrum and discuss the contribution
  of pulsars in the energy range of cosmic rays. They use the Gunn & Ostriker model
  to predict the energy spectrum of cosmic rays emitted by pulsars and find that the
  maximum energy from pulsars is barely above the energy range of cosmic rays. The
  authors also consider different mechanisms of acceleration and discuss the implications
  of pulsar contribution to the cosmic-ray spectrum.
