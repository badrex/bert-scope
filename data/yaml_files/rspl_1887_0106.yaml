tldr: This study examines the air quality and ventilation in sewers under the Houses
  of Parliament and various sewers in Dundee. The authors found that sewer air contained
  higher levels of carbonic acid and organic matter compared to outside air, but fewer
  microorganisms. The air quality in sewers was found to be better than that of naturally
  ventilated schools and slightly better than one-roomed houses. The authors also
  noted that the sewers they examined were better ventilated than those in previous
  studies.
