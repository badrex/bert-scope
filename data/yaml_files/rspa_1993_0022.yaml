tldr: The authors investigate the mechanisms of load transfer in single carbon-fibre/epoxy-resin
  model composites using laser Raman spectroscopy. They monitor the fibre fragmentation
  process under incremental tensile loading and evaluate the interfacial shear stress
  distribution using a balance of forces analysis. The effects of fibre surface treatment
  and fibre modulus on stress transfer profiles are also examined.
