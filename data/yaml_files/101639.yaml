tldr: Dr. Gothofredus Guil. Leibnitz describes his invention of a new principle for
  making precise portable watches. Instead of relying on equal vibrations of pendulums
  or springs, his method is based on a mechanical reflection that ensures uniform
  play between two springs. This innovation allows for more accurate timekeeping and
  eliminates the need for a fusee and string or chain. The article also addresses
  potential objections and offers solutions for using these watches in challenging
  environments, such as at sea.
