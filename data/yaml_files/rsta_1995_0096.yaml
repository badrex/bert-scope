tldr: The authors prove a version of the Narasimhan-Seshadri theorem for stable parabolic
  bundles using an orbifold approach. They establish a correspondence between stable
  parabolic structures on Riemann surfaces and Yang-Mills connections on associated
  orbifold bundles, providing a new insight into the problem and its potential applications.
