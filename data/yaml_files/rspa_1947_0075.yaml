tldr: The authors determined the crystal structure of sucrose sodium bromide dihydrate
  using X-ray diffraction and space group analysis. They found that the pyranose ring
  of the molecule is in the Sachse trans form, and the furanose ring is a compact
  grouping with one member displaced from the plane of the other four. The sucrose
  molecules are held together by bonds from the hydroxyl groups to the sodium and
  bromine ions and water molecules. This study provides valuable insights into the
  conformation of saccharide molecules and the external bonding of the hydroxyl groups
  in the sugar molecule.
