tldr: This study investigates the demography and human adaptability of two New Guinea
  communities on Karkar Island. The research focuses on the population's age and sex
  structure, marital status, fertility rates, and reproductive patterns. The findings
  reveal a marked recent population expansion with a predominance of younger age groups,
  and a higher fertility rate compared to other communities in the region. The study
  contributes to understanding demographic trends in isolated communities and the
  impact of external factors on their population dynamics.
