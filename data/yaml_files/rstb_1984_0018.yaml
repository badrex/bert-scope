tldr: This article explores the effects of bubble-induced ischaemia on the central
  nervous system, focusing on the role of leucocyte accumulation and the relationship
  between circumscribed brain oedema and neuronal injury. The authors discuss the
  potential implications of these findings for understanding and treating decompression
  sickness.
