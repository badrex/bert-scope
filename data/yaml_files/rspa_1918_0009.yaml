tldr: The authors discuss the behavior of scattering media in fully diffused light,
  introducing the concepts of rejectance, obstructance, and transmittance. They develop
  equations to describe the relationships between these properties and explore how
  they change with the thickness of the medium. The authors also propose a method
  for measuring these properties in practical photometry applications.
