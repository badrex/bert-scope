tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the rate of propagation of the luminous
  discharge of electricity through a rarefied gas. They found that the luminosity
  travels from the anode to the cathode and discovered that the velocity of the discharge
  is finite. This research helped in understanding the behavior of the positive column
  in the discharge tube.
