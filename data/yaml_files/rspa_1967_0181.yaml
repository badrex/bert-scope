tldr: The authors studied the effects of oxygen on radiation-induced reactions of
  ethylene in aqueous solutions using pulse radiolysis and y-irradiation techniques.
  They found that oxygen replaces polymerization with oxidation and observed the formation
  and further reactions of peroxy radicals. The results complement previous studies
  and provide insights into the radiation chemistry of ethylene and oxygen in aqueous
  solutions.
