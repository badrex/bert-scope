tldr: This article examines the evolution of human bipedalism by analyzing the locomotion
  of Australopithecus, an early hominoid. The author discusses the challenges in understanding
  the biomechanics of fossil remains and the importance of studying the innominate
  bone to determine the use of the hindlimb in Australopithecus. The article concludes
  that the unique morphology of the innominate bone suggests that Australopithecus
  had a different form of bipedalism compared to Homo sapiens and may have used its
  hindlimb in both arboreal and terrestrial locomotion.
