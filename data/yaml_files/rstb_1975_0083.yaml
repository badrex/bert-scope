tldr: This study compares the rates of early seed development in various species within
  the Triticeae family, which play a significant role in human nutrition. The research
  focuses on embryo and endosperm development during the first five days after pollination
  in 22 different genotypes grown under continuous light. The results show that the
  pattern of early seed development is similar across wheat, rye, Triticale, and barley,
  with some variations in the rate between genotypes. The study provides a baseline
  for further research on abnormal seed development and factors influencing the rate
  and extent of early embryo and endosperm development in these important crop species.
