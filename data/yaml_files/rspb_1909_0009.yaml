tldr: The author investigates the selective permeability of the seed coverings in
  Hordeum Vulgare, discovering that they act as a semi-permeable membrane allowing
  water and certain substances to pass through while preventing others. This research
  contributes to our understanding of plant physiology and membrane biology.
