tldr: The authors investigated the thermoluminescence, phosphorescence, and fluorescence
  spectra of polyethylene, polystyrene, polytetrafluoroethylene, and polypropylene.
  They identified that these luminescent properties are due to carbonyl groups attached
  to the molecular chains. The study also suggests that molecular oxygen acts as an
  electron trap, affecting the thermoluminescence output at different temperatures.
