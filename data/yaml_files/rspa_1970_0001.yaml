tldr: The authors explore methods to interpret optical projections, such as X-ray
  shadowgraphs and phase-contrast microscopy, by using Fourier transforms and statistical
  analysis. They demonstrate how to calculate the density function of an object from
  its projections and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding
  complex systems.
