tldr: This study reviews the fossil vole remains (Rodentia, Microtinae) from the Lower
  Pleistocene deposits in eastern England, focusing on the Norwich Crag and Cromer
  Forest-bed Formations. The authors recognize several vole species and describe two
  new species, Mimomys pitymyoides and Mimomys gensis, for the first time from Britain.
  The research helps clarify the relative position of the Bramertonian and Pre-Pastonian
  stages and contributes to the understanding of the British Lower Pleistocene assemblages.
