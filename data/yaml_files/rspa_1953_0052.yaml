tldr: This study investigates how environmental factors, such as glucose availability
  and bacterial strain adaptation, affect the survival curve of \lt;italic\gt;Bact.
  lactis aerogenes\lt;/italic\gt;. The research finds that shortage of glucose during
  growth and serial subculture in a synthetic medium lead to initial delays in the
  decline of the bacterial population. The study also suggests that low permeability
  and co-operative protective effects are not the main causes of delayed lethal action.
