tldr: The author examines the changes that have occurred in ancient copper alloys
  found in artifacts such as helmets, nails, and mirrors. They observe the formation
  of crystalline structures and discuss the possible causes, including chemical affinity,
  electro-chemical attraction, and attraction of aggregation. This study may help
  explain phenomena in mineralogy and geology.
