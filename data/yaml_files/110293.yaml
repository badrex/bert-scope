tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday describes his experimental research on electricity,
  focusing on electromagnetic induction and the electro-tonic state. He demonstrates
  that electric currents can induce similar currents in nearby wires, and that these
  induced currents can be influenced by magnets. Faraday also discovers that when
  a conductor is subjected to either voltaic or magneto-electric induction, it enters
  a unique state he calls the "electro-tonic state." Additionally, he explains that
  when a piece of metal moves in a specific direction near a magnetic pole, electrical
  currents are generated within the metal. This discovery helps clarify the phenomena
  observed in experiments by Arago and others, which were previously attributed to
  simple magnetic induction.
