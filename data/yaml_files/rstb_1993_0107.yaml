tldr: This article discusses the use of sedimentary facies and oxygen isotopes as
  indicators of Mesozoic palaeoclimate. Sedimentary facies, such as laterites, evaporites,
  and aeolianites, provide equivocal and qualitative evidence about Mesozoic climates
  and climate changes. Oxygen isotopic data, obtained from carbonates, help determine
  palaeotemperatures but must be critically evaluated due to possible diagenetic resetting
  and other factors.
