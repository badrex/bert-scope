tldr: This article presents weather observations made during a voyage to Hudson by
  Christopher Middleton. The observations were recorded using a new Quicksilver Marine
  Barometer created by Mr. John Patrick. The data includes wind direction and speed,
  as well as temperature and atmospheric pressure readings. These measurements were
  taken from noon to noon each day, providing valuable information about weather patterns
  at sea.
