tldr: The author examines Poisson's solution of the equations of fluid motion and
  the transmission of sound through a cylindrical tube. They argue that the failure
  to derive a solution containing two arbitrary functions from the equations of motion
  of the received theory is not due to difficulties of integration but rather the
  defective law of pressure. The author presents a new solution that satisfies certain
  conditions and discusses the implications for the theory of partial differential
  equations.
