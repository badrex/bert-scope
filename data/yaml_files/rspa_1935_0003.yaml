tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of potassium chloride in aqueous solutions
  and its relationship with concentration. The researchers used a porous membrane
  method to measure the diffusion coefficient of potassium chloride at 25Â°C over a
  range of concentrations from 0.1 to 2.0 N. The results show that the diffusion coefficient
  increases with concentration, and the findings are compared with previous records
  and theoretical treatments. This research provides valuable insights into the behavior
  of electrolytes in solution and has implications for understanding diffusion processes
  in various applications.
