tldr: The authors analyze the limits of symmetry violations in neutral kaon decays,
  focusing on CP-, T-, and TCP-invariance. They find evidence of small departures
  from CP- and TCP-invariance in the structure of and states, but no evidence of T-invariance.
  The study provides improved limits on the variances from these symmetries and suggests
  potential methods to further improve these limits.
