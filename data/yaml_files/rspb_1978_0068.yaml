tldr: This study investigates the presence of phytoferritin, an iron-protein macromolecule,
  in the reproductive cells of the fern Pteridium aquilinum. Using electron microscopy
  and microanalysis, the researchers found that the phytoferritin in these cells is
  similar to that found in other vascular plants and fungi. They also discovered that
  the aggregates of phytoferritin in Pteridium are not crystalline, but crystallinity
  is revealed by optical diffractometry.
