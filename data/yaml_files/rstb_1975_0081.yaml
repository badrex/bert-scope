tldr: This article discusses the high degree of specificity often found in biological
  systems and how it can be explained by unique mechanisms. The authors explore examples
  of enzyme specificity and the role of natural selection in creating these mechanisms.
  They also touch upon the importance of understanding these processes to better comprehend
  the functioning of biological systems.
