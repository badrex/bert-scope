tldr: The author investigates the influence of temperature on the dispersion of light
  and its relation to the chemical structure of compounds. They find that the dispersion
  equivalent, a measure of a compound's ability to disperse light, is primarily determined
  by the atomic constitution of the substance. The author also discovers that the
  dispersion of a compound can reveal differences in its constitution that are not
  recognized by chemists or expressed in existing formulas.
