tldr: The authors experimentally examined the behavior of a strut in a rigidly jointed
  truss framework. They found that the dynamic jump is governed by the interchange
  of elastic strain energy, plastic work, and kinetic and potential energy. The strut's
  behavior is oscillatory, and the amplitude of oscillations is small compared to
  the initial jump. The study focused on understanding the deformation modes and the
  effect of strut length on the dynamic behavior.
