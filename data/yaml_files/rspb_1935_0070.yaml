tldr: The author investigates the resting nuclei and mitotic phenomena of plants,
  specifically focusing on intra-specific polyploids. They provide evidence that supports
  the idea of prochromosomes as precise portions of chromosomes and demonstrate their
  persistence throughout the mitotic cycle. This research contributes to the understanding
  of plant nuclei structure and behavior, bridging the gap between morphological and
  experimental fields of observation.
