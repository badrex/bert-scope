tldr: The author conducts research on the structure, physiology, and development of
  Antedon rosaceus, a unique and rare species of the Crinoidea order. The study aims
  to provide a better understanding of this group of animals and contribute to the
  solution of fundamental questions in general physiology. The research focuses on
  the peculiar interest of Antedon as a typical form, being the only representative
  of the Crinoidea order in British seas. The author also discusses the history of
  Antedon research, from the earliest accounts by Fabius Columella to the works of
  Edward Lhuyd and others.
