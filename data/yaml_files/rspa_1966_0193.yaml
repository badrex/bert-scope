  Propagation'

tldr: The authors provide a solution for the problem of elastic wave propagation from
  a finite line source, considering it as the limit of an elongated ellipsoid of revolution.
  They show that, in addition to a pressure wave, a shear wave is generated, which
  becomes more significant for higher values of Poisson's constant. The study contributes
  to understanding seismic wave propagation in solid media.
