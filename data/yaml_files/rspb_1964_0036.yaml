tldr: The authors investigated the effects of intracellular ionic injections on inhibitory
  postsynaptic potentials in cat motoneurons. They found that injecting cations and
  anions into the cells caused a depolarizing shift in the membrane potential, while
  injecting anions alone caused a slight hyperpolarizing shift. These findings suggest
  that both cation and anion movements play a role in the generation of inhibitory
  postsynaptic potentials.
