tldr: The sedimentary record of Antarctica contains a wealth of information about
  past climate changes and ocean circulation. This record complements the ice sheet
  record and extends it back in time, providing valuable insights into the effects
  of climate change on sedimentation. The study of sedimentary records can help us
  understand how aspects of modern circulation and climate have varied in the past,
  and how they may change in the future.
