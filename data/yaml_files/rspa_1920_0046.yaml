tldr: The author extended the Balmer series of hydrogen by using very long vacuum
  tubes and discovered a new type of vacuum tube and various spectroscopic phenomena.
  By reducing the continuous background and secondary spectrum, the author was able
  to photograph the series down to the 20th line, opening up a new field for the separation
  and study of compound spectra.
