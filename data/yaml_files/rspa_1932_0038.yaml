tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the oxidation of phosphorus vapour
  at low pressures in the presence of platinum and tungsten. They found that the reaction
  occurs entirely on the surface of the platinum filament, while tungsten can initiate
  the reaction at its surface, with chains spreading into the gas and presumably terminating
  on the walls of the reaction tube. The results suggest that the reaction is heterogeneous
  and partly homogeneous, with the reaction rate being independent of phosphorus and
  argon concentration.
