tldr: The study examines the external sensory morphology and ultrastructure of the
  wings and thorax of the parasitoid wasp, Trichogramma minutum. It describes various
  sensilla and non-innervated hairs on the thorax and wings, which are mainly mechanosensory.
  The research also discusses the function of these structures in relation to the
  flight mechanism and control in small insects. The findings contribute to understanding
  the sensory control of flight parameters in Trichogramma and other small insects.
