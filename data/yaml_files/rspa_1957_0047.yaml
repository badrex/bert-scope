tldr: The author proposes a new approximation for the radial distribution function,
  which is an improvement over the well-known superposition assumption of Kirkwood.
  This new approximation is introduced into the Born-Green integral equation for the
  radial distribution function and is applied to the ideal case of a gas of rigid
  spheres. The results show that the new approximation is more accurate and consistent
  compared to previous methods.
