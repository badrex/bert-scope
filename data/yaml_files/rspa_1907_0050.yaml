tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a closed vessel to investigate the burning
  law of modified cordite. They discovered that the burning relation is expressed
  by an equation of the form S = aP + C, where a varies with the initial temperature
  of the cordite. The authors also found that there is a two-phase condition in the
  burning of tubes, with excess internal pressure existing in the first phase. This
  theory helps explain ballistic and other phenomena related to the burning of tubes
  and has practical applications in gun technology.
