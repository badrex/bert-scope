tldr: The author conducted extensive research on the composition and effects of gunpowder,
  analyzing its decomposition, pressure in closed vessels, and gas expansion. They
  examined previous research and experiments, including those by Robins, Hutton, and
  Rumford, and presented their findings on the pressure and tension of fired gunpowder.
  This study aimed to provide a better understanding of gunpowder for use in heavy
  ordnance and improve the knowledge of its intricate and complex phenomena.
