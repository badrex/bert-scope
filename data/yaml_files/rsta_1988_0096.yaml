tldr: The authors introduce a physical analogy to describe problems and high-performance
  concurrent computers. They discuss the spatial and temporal characteristics of problems
  and how they lead to parallelism. The paper also reviews the lessons from the use
  of early hypercubes and explores the unification of distributed, shared, and hierarchical
  memories, as well as SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) architectures. The
  authors also show how neural network methods can be used to analyze a general formalism
  based on interacting strings, leading to possible real-time schedulers and decomposers
  for massively parallel machines.
