tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the refraction of sound by the atmosphere
  and its relation to temperature gradients. They discovered that sound can be intensified
  at the surface of water under specific atmospheric conditions, such as a temperature
  gradient with colder air near the surface. This phenomenon can explain the increased
  audibility of sounds over long distances in certain situations.
