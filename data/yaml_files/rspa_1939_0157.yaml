tldr: This article discusses the methods used to measure terrestrial heat flow in
  Great Britain. The authors used a divided bar apparatus to measure the thermal conductivities
  of various rock samples and determined the temperature gradients in the earth's
  crust. They found that the heat flow in Britain and South Africa was lower than
  previously estimated, and the measurements provided valuable insights into the geothermal
  energy potential of the region.
