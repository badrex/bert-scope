tldr: The authors develop a crystallographic treatment to analyze periodic grain boundary
  structures in aluminium, using transmission electron microscope observations. They
  investigate the relation between grain boundary structure and its location between
  relatively translated crystals, and characterize line defects that can exist in
  grain boundaries. This analysis aids in understanding the properties and behavior
  of aluminium alloys.
