tldr: The authors measured the cross sections for the reactions 27Al(n,α) and 56Fe(n,p)
  using a radioactivation method with 14 MeV neutrons. They determined the neutron
  flux by intercepting both neutrons and alpha particles over a large solid angle
  and estimating the integrated alpha particle flux in terms of the volume of helium
  gas formed. The study aimed to establish accurate cross sections for these reactions,
  which can be used as reference reactions in nuclear physics research.
