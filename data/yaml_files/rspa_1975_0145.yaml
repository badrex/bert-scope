tldr: This study investigates the melting of small bismuth particles and discovers
  a time delay in the melting process. The research also reveals that the characteristic
  time for melting depends on the temperature and morphology of the particles. Platelet-shaped
  bismuth particles exhibit a significant time delay, allowing some to be superheated
  by up to 7K above the bulk melting point.
