tldr: This article reviews the theories of nematic order in thermotropic liquid crystals,
  focusing on molecular alignment and correlations. It discusses the Maier-Saupe approach,
  mean field theories, and the limitations of these theories in explaining the behavior
  of real nematic materials. The author also highlights the importance of director
  fluctuations and the range of molecular correlations in nematic liquids.
