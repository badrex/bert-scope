tldr: This article discusses the origin and function of centric fragments in pollen-part
  mutants of Nicotiana alata and Lycopersicum peruvianum. The authors propose that
  these fragments may originate from the satellited arm of chromosome 3 and play a
  role in bypassing self-incompatibility reactions. The research provides insights
  into the genetic mechanisms governing self-incompatibility and cross-incompatibility
  in flowering plants.
