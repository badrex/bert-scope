revised_title: Innovative Approaches to Higher Derivatives in Geometry and Physics
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Differential Geometry
semantic_tags:

tldr: The article explores two methods to study higher derivatives, new-tensors, and
  derivative strings, and introduces the concept of suppression operators. It also
  discusses the impact of these new approaches on physics, including the extension
  of Riemann metrics and the exploration of electrogravitic potentials.
