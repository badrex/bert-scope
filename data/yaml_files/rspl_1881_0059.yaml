tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the coefficients of expansion
  of di-iodide of lead (PbI2) and an alloy of iodide of lead with iodide of silver
  (PbI2.AgI). They discovered that the iodide of lead has three coefficients of expansion,
  with a rapid expansion occurring between 253°C and 265°C. The author also found
  that the specific gravity of iodide of lead is less than the mean specific gravity
  of its constituents.
