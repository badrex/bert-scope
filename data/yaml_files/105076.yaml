tldr: Dr. Mordach Mackenzie's letters provide insights into the plague at Constantinople,
  its symptoms, and prevention methods. He observes that the plague is mostly sporadic
  and not epidemical, and people avoid infected areas. Mackenzie also discusses the
  differences in European and eastern plagues, the effectiveness of quarantine measures,
  and the importance of maintaining a cool regimen during the illness.
