tldr: The authors present two phase-field models for the solidification of eutectic
  alloys, a process in which a liquid can transform into two distinct solid phases.
  The models allow for a more accurate representation of the solid-solid interface
  and provide a general treatment for different crystalline structures. The phase-field
  models are derived from a thermodynamically consistent approach and can describe
  solidification for various compositions.
