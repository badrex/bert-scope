tldr: The authors extend the study of air drag's effect on satellite orbits, considering
  an oblate atmosphere. They derive equations that show how perigee distance, orbital
  period, and eccentricity vary with time. The influence of atmospheric oblateness
  is found to be significant, affecting the lifetime and air density at perigee. The
  study is important for understanding the behavior of satellites in orbit and for
  designing long-lasting satellite missions.
