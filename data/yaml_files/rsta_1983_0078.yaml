tldr: This article discusses the advancements and future developments in the science
  and technology of hydraulic cements during the 1990s. It highlights the importance
  of high-technology-low-volume innovations, such as alkali-resistant glass-fiber
  reinforced composites and mdf cements, and emphasizes the need for more research
  and development in basic materials, processing, and concrete performance behavior.
  The article also stresses the significance of improving R&D planning, management,
  and education to enhance the performance of cement products.
