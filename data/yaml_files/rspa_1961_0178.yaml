  interaction'

tldr: This article investigates the electron-phonon interaction in alkali metals at
  low temperatures. The authors examine the effects of the distorted Fermi surface
  on the transport properties of metals and propose a new matrix element for the probability
  of electron transitions. They use the nearly free electrons model to calculate the
  form of the matrix element and discuss its potential consequences on the transport
  properties of metals.
