tldr: The authors discuss the challenges and strategies for controlling migrant pests,
  such as blackflies and locusts, in developing countries. They emphasize the importance
  of integrated control and synecological approaches, which consider the relationships
  between different pests and their environments. The authors also highlight the need
  for better training and coordination in pest control efforts, as well as the role
  of technology and meteorology in managing these pests.
