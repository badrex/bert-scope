tldr: The study investigates the stimulation of the acoustico-lateralis system in
  clupeid fish, specifically herring and sprat, by external sources and their own
  movements. The fish's movements create antisymmetric pressures that oppose head
  accelerations, while external sources generate mostly symmetric pressures. The research
  explores the differences in receptor organ stimulation patterns between external
  and self-generated vibrations and how fish can obtain useful information from these
  stimuli.
