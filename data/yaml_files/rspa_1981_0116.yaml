tldr: The authors present an approximate method to solve the second moment equation
  for waveguides containing random irregularities with arbitrary refractive index
  profiles. They illustrate the method for a waveguide with a cubic profile and discuss
  its physical significance. This study is important for understanding wave propagation
  in various applications, such as optical fibers, ionospheric ducts, and the ocean.
