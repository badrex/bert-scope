tldr: This article investigates the relationship between microorganisms, specifically
  bacteria, and the decay of stone. The authors discuss previous research on the topic
  and present their findings on bacterial populations in decaying and sound stone.
  They also explore the role of nitrifying bacteria in stone decay and suggest that
  further investigation is needed to understand the full extent of microbial involvement
  in this process.
