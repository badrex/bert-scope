tldr: 'The author explores the properties of functions of positive and negative type
  and their connection to integral equations. They classify continuous symmetric functions
  into three categories: ambiguous type, positive type, and negative type. The author
  also demonstrates that functions of positive or negative type can be expanded as
  a series of products of normal functions, and that this series converges both absolutely
  and uniformly.'
