tldr: John Pond presents a catalog of North Polar Distances of some principal fixed
  stars, obtained through observations made with the new Mural Circle. He believes
  the instrument to be highly accurate and hopes to improve its precision in the future.
  The catalog provides a valuable resource for astronomers, as it offers a more accurate
  measurement of celestial positions than previous methods.
