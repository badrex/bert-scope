tldr: This study presents a numerical analysis of a thermokinetic model for oscillatory
  cool flames and complex ignition phenomena in ethanal oxidation under well-stirred
  flowing conditions. The research predicts and explains the different reaction modes,
  including oscillatory cool flames, two-stage, and multiple-stage ignitions, in a
  non-adiabatic, well-stirred flow reactor. The findings provide insights into the
  origins of complex oscillatory waveforms for cool flames and help establish a comprehensive
  understanding of the non-isothermal phenomena in ethanal oxidation.
