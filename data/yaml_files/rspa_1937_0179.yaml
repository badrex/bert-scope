tldr: The author presents a solution to Oseen's equations for the motion of a viscous
  fluid around an inclined elliptic cylinder. The study involves the use of Mathieu
  functions and explores the forces acting on the cylinder, including lift and drag,
  as functions of the angle of incidence. The results show that the drag is much greater
  than that of a normal aerofoil, while the lift is similar. The study also demonstrates
  the importance of considering the boundary layer and the effect of Reynolds numbers
  on the flow.
