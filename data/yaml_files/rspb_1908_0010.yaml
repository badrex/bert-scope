tldr: 'This study examines the inheritance of eye color in humans, focusing on the
  presence or absence of anterior pigment in the iris. The author identifies two types
  of eye color: simplex, with only posterior pigment, and duplex, with both anterior
  and posterior pigments. The study finds that eye color follows Mendelian inheritance
  patterns, with the duplex type being dominant over the simplex type. The research
  provides insights into the genetic basis of eye color and its inheritance patterns.'
