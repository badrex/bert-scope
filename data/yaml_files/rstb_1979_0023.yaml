tldr: This article reviews historical records of giant tortoise populations in the
  western Indian Ocean, focusing on their decline and extinction on many islands during
  the 17th to 19th centuries. The authors discuss the causes of decline and extinction
  and consider the implications for the history of the Aldabra population. They also
