tldr: The author, Richard Mc Causland, challenges the common belief that Native Americans
  lack beards. He shares his observations and experiences living among the Six-Nations,
  providing evidence that they have beards, which they pluck out from a young age.
  The text also offers insights into the social structure, customs, and traditions
  of the Six-Nations, including their tribal divisions, hereditary leadership, and
  the role of women in their society.
