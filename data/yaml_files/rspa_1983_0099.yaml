  in a Well Stirred Continuous Flow Reactor: A Detailed Analysis'

tldr: The authors present a detailed analysis of the Gray-Yang'skeleton' model of
  hydrocarbon oxidation, which unifies the thermal and chain branching theories. They
  investigate the nature of thermokinetic steady states and the transitions between
  them, focusing on the existence of stable limit cycles, oscillations, and bifurcations.
  The study shows good agreement with experimental observations in continuously stirred
  tank reactors, particularly for the combustion of acetaldehyde.
