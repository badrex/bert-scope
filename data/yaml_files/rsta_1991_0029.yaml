tldr: This article investigates the quasi-particle properties and plasmon spectra
  in single and double quantum well systems. It finds significant changes from bulk
  parameters, with strong dependencies on electron density and interwell separation.
  Low-energy plasmon modes dominate the quasi-particle lifetime, leading to scattering
  rates up to an order of magnitude higher than optic phonons in these systems.
