tldr: The author establishes a one-to-one correspondence between static Einstein-Maxwell
  and stationary Einstein-vacuum space-times, allowing for a direct transformation
  between these solutions. This correspondence is achieved by writing the metrics
  in adapted coordinates and gauges for the two-centre problem and black holes with
  event horizons. The author demonstrates this method using the example of two extreme
  Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.
