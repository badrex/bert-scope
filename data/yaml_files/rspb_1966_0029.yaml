tldr: The authors discovered that bacterial DNA is associated with the cell membrane
  and that this association plays a crucial role in DNA replication. They proposed
  the replicon model, which suggests that each DNA structure, or replicon, controls
  its own replication. This model explains the efficiency of genetic transfer in bacteria
  and provides insights into the relationship between DNA replication and cellular
  growth.
