tldr: This study examines the development of vegetation in English lakes and its relation
  to the general evolution of glacial lakes and rock basins. The research focuses
  on eleven larger lakes and explores how factors such as wave action, fluvial sediments,
  and regional erosion influence the distribution and characteristics of aquatic plants.
  The findings reveal that as lakes age, their vegetation and fauna change in response
  to the stages in their topographical evolution.
