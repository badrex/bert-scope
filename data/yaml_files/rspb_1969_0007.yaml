tldr: The authors discovered that adult schistosomes, the parasites responsible for
  schistosomiasis, can evade the host's immune system by incorporating host antigens
  into their surface. This allows the worms to avoid being destroyed by the host's
  immune response, enabling them to persist in the blood for long periods. The study
  provides insights into the complex relationship between the parasite and the host,
  and may lead to new strategies for treating and preventing schistosomiasis.
