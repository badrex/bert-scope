tldr: This article describes the fossil plant discoveries made during Edward Whymper's
  1867 expedition to North Greenland. The findings, which include 73 species, confirm
  the age of the deposits as Lower Miocene and provide insight into the climate and
  vegetation of the region during that time. The collected specimens were deposited
  in the British Museum.
