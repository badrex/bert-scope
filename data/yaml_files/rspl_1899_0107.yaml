tldr: This article explores the inheritance of coat color in horses and eye color
  in humans, using statistical methods to analyze the correlation and intensity of
  heredity. The author finds that these traits do not follow the law of ancestral
  heredity and suggests that exclusive inheritance without reversion may be a more
  accurate description of these phenomena. The study also highlights the importance
  of further research on the intensity and form of inheritance for various characters
  in different species.
