tldr: Dr. Herapath reports on his research into the optical and chemical properties
  of crystalline compounds of iodine and strychnine. He describes the unique crystalline
  forms and absorption properties of these compounds, including a formula for one
  of them. He also mentions a sulfate of iodo-strychnia with distinct metallic green
  reflexion. The research is ongoing, and Dr. Herapath plans to share more findings
  with the Royal Society.
