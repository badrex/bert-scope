tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the role of the liver in sugar
  formation. They discovered that the liver does not play a significant role in sugar
  formation during life, and the high sugar levels found in the liver after death
  are not representative of the liver's function during life. This challenges the
  previously accepted understanding of liver function in sugar formation.
