tldr: The author conducted experiments with various transplantable tumor strains in
  animals to study the manifestation of active resistance to cancer growth. They discovered
  that the resistance to re-inoculation is of the nature of an active immunity, and
  the understanding of this phenomenon has advanced the knowledge of cancer research.
  The author found that the power of rendering a soil unsuitable for further inoculations
  is a distinctive feature of various tumor strains, and this factor plays a significant
  role in determining the character of tumor growth.
