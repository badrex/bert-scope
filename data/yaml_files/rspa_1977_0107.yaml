tldr: This article discusses the neutral and radiative decay modes of new resonances
  through experiments conducted at the Deutsches Elektronen-Synchrotron (DESY) using
  the DORIS accelerator. The authors present preliminary results on the decay of new
  particles and their final states containing photons. They analyze the detector design
  and the data collected to determine the properties of the new resonances and their
  decay modes.
