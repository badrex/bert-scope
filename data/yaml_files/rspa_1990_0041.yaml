tldr: The authors present a moment asymptotic expansion technique for the analysis
  of generalized functions, which holds for various types of kernels, including those
  of rapid decay and rapid oscillation. This approach allows for the study of asymptotic
  expansions of integrals, series, and multidimensional cases, and is applicable to
  several spaces of distributions. The technique also provides error bounds and can
  be used in diverse fields of mathematics and physics.
