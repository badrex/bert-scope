tldr: The author presents a simple geometrical construction that provides a very approximate
  quadrature of the circle. By placing a chord in the arc of the circle and bisecting
  it, the construction allows for an estimation of the area of the circle with an
  error of less than one four-thousandth part of the side of a square with the same
  area.
