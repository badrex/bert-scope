tldr: This article investigates the effect of temperature variations on the accuracy
  of Clark cells, which are used as a standard of electromotive force. The authors
  conducted experiments to determine the temperature coefficients and the extent of
  corrections needed for temperature changes in practice. They found that cells respond
  readily to temperature changes and that the accuracy of the standard can be affected
  by these variations.
