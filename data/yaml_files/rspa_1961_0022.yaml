  Evolution
scientific_discipline: Physics > Astronomy
semantic_tags:
- Stellar magnetic fields

- Magnetic field effects
tldr: 'This article discusses the observed magnetic fields in some stars and their
  potential influence on stellar evolution. It explores two main models for magnetic
  field generation: the oblique rotator model and the solar-cycle model. The author
  also examines the effects of magnetic fields on stellar hydrostatic and thermal
  equilibrium, as well as on stellar vibrations.'
