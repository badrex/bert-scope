tldr: The author investigates the yellow coloration in urine and concludes that it
  is not primarily due to urobilin, as previously thought. They suggest the presence
  of another, more abundant yellow pigment, which has yet to be isolated and fully
  understood. The author also discusses the limitations of previous methods for isolating
  the pigment and proposes a new approach to study it.
