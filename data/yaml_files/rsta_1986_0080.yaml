tldr: This discussion meeting focuses on the scientific aspects of nuclear waste management,
  particularly for highly active and longer-lived wastes. It explores geological and
  marine research related to disposal routes and the potential pathways of nuclear
  waste back into the food chain. The meeting does not advocate for nuclear power
  programs but emphasizes the need for responsible management of radioactive waste,
  regardless of future nuclear activities.
