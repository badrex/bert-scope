tldr: This study investigates the thermodynamics of gaseous oxides in platinum-group
  metals, focusing on the enhanced volatility of these metals in oxygen at high temperatures.
  The authors measure the pressure of the oxide as the partial pressure of oxygen
  and metal activity are varied, providing insights into the formation and properties
  of volatile oxides in these metals.
