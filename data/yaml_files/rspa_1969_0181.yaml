tldr: The author explores the properties of a vacuum metric representing a spherical-fronted
  gravitational wave with cylindrical symmetry. They introduce bending terms into
  Rosen's metric for cylindrical waves, examining the transition from cylindrical
  to spherical waves and their asymptotic behavior. The study provides further understanding
  of the axial singularity and the nature of the radiation.
