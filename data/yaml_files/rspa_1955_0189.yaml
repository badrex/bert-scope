tldr: This article discusses the concept of time reversal in field theory, focusing
  on its relation to relativistic invariance and symmetry in space. The author demonstrates
  that in local classical field theories, a certain kind of reversibility is an automatic
  consequence of these principles. The article also explores the quantum-theoretical
  analogues of these findings, including the effects of time reversal on quantities
  constructed from the variables.
