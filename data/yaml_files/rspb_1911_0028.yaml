tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of arsenates and arsenites
  on the fermentation of sugars by yeast juice. They discovered that arsenates significantly
  affect fermentation, causing a temporary acceleration in the rate of carbon dioxide
  evolution. Unlike phosphates, arsenates do not form organic combinations and their
  effect on fermentation continues even after the evolution of an equivalent amount
  of carbon dioxide. The study also found that there is an optimum concentration of
  arsenate that corresponds to a maximum rate of fermentation.
