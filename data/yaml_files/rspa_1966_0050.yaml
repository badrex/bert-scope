tldr: This article discusses the nature of seismic noise, which is caused by the interference
  of seismic signals reflected or refracted by inhomogeneities in the Earth's structure.
  The authors analyze the statistical properties of seismic noise and propose a method
  to calculate its average properties using correlation functions. They also explore
  the scattering of body waves in an inhomogeneous medium and the efficiency of different
  scattering processes.
