tldr: This study investigates the leakage of surface electromagnetic fields through
  holes and cracks in metal plates. The research focuses on thin-skin surface currents
  applied to conducting plates with through holes or cracks. The paper provides mathematical
  models for electric field distributions and confirms the incident and leakage field
  distributions for both circular holes and through cracks using experiments.
