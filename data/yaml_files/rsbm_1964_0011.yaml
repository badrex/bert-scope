tldr: David Keilin was a renowned entomologist and parasitologist who made significant
  contributions to the understanding of insect development, parasitism, and physiology.
  He discovered the life cycle of the common calliphorine fly Pollenia rudis and its
  parasitic relationship with the earthworm. Keilin also studied dipterous larvae,
  discovering developmental cycles and demonstrating remarkable phylogenetic and adaptive
  phenomena in insects. His work on cellular physiology and biochemistry helped advance
  research in the respiratory requirements and adaptations of dipterous larvae.
