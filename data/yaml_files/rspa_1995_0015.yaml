tldr: The author investigates convective fluid motions in a rapidly rotating spherical
  shell with an imposed azimuthal axisymmetric magnetic field. They find that the
  effects of the magnetic field on thermal convection are crucially dependent on the
  size of the Prandtl number, and that the Lorentz force does not make fluid motions
  fully three-dimensional. The study has implications for understanding convection
  in planetary and astrophysical fluid dynamics, such as the Earth's core and the
  solar convection.
