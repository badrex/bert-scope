tldr: The authors investigated the effective valencies of transition metals in solid
  solutions in gold and silver alloys. They found that the effective valency of transition
  metals decreases with an increase in electron-to-atom ratio and transition metal
  content. The results demonstrate the dependence of effective valencies on the exact
  nature of the environment of the dissolved atoms in these alloys.
