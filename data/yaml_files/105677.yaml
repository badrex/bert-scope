tldr: In a letter to Rev. Mr. Nevil Maskelyne, M. De la Lande discusses the importance
  of accurate astronomical observations for determining longitude at sea. He mentions
  the use of sector and plumb-line instruments, as well as the need for better understanding
  the differences in meridians between various locations. He also shares his observations
  of the occultations of stars and planets, which can help in determining the difference
  in longitude between London and Paris.
