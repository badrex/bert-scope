tldr: The authors study the reflexion of cylindrical gravitational waves by a thin
  rigid cylindrical shell, considering it as a surface distribution. They show that
  if the shell is perfectly rigid, total reflexion occurs. Quasi-periodic incident
  waves lead to a completely periodic standing wave state between the reflector and
  a central wave-source, with the field outside the system remaining static.
