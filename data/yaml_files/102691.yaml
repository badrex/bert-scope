tldr: In this article, Fra. Hauksbee describes his experiments on the extraordinary
  electricity of glass and its effects. He discovered that rubbing glass generates
  an electric effluvium that can attract and repel small objects, and that this effluvium
  can be affected by the presence of air, moisture, and vacuum. Hauksbee also observed
  that the electricity produced by glass could create a light phenomenon and interact
  with other materials, such as muslin and metal.
