tldr: The authors developed a new method for calculating molecular orbital wave functions
  for methane and silane using the Hartree self-consistent field method. They found
  that the central field approximation, which treats the molecule as a single entity,
  is a good approximation for these molecules. However, the method fails to predict
  a stable bound state for silane, and there is still a discrepancy between the calculated
  and experimental bond lengths. The authors suggest that further improvements may
  be needed in the central field approximation or the molecular orbital method itself.
