tldr: The author presents a general analysis of the perturbation problem where the
  perturbed equation has a continuous spectrum, while the unperturbed equation has
  a discrete spectrum. They show that in certain cases, the function that determines
  the spectrum has a pole just below the real axis, leading to a highly concentrated
  perturbed spectrum instead of a perturbed eigenvalue. This study applies to various
  cases, including the example where the spectrum of the differential equation is
  discrete over the interval 0 < A < 0, while that of the perturbed equation is continuous
  over this interval.
