tldr: The authors analyzed the carbon chemistry of Luna 16 and 20 samples, revealing
  that both soils are highly mature and have experienced similar exposure on the lunar
  surface. They found that the concentration of hydrolysable carbon species in the
  samples is associated with metallic iron, and the ratio of involatile to volatile
  carbon provides information about the thermal history of various particle types.
  The study also showed that the finer fractions of the samples have lower ratios
  and higher absolute amounts of hydrolysable carbon.
