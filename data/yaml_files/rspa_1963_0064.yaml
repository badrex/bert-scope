tldr: The authors studied the pressure broadening of vibration-rotation bands in carbon
  monoxide (CO) and deuterium chloride (DC1) when exposed to various foreign gases.
  They calculated optical collision diameters and analyzed the interaction forces
  between the molecules. The results showed that optical collision diameters are influenced
  by the nature and magnitude of intermolecular forces, with dispersion forces being
  dominant in the case of CO. The authors also discussed the variation of line width
  in the bands with rotational quantum number, which is not yet fully understood.
