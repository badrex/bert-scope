tldr: The authors conducted an experiment using a Michelson interferometer to investigate
  the effect of a transverse magnetic field on the velocity of light in vacuum. They
  found that the sensitivity of their method allowed them to observe small changes
  in the interference bands, which could be used to measure the impact of the magnetic
  field on the light's velocity. This research improved the understanding of the interaction
  between light and magnetic fields, which could have implications for various scientific
  and technological applications.
