tldr: The authors investigated the effect of external Tris on sodium channels in squid
  giant axons. They found that Tris reduced the sodium current in a voltage-dependent
  manner, affecting the permeability coefficient. This discovery has implications
  for understanding the properties of sodium channels in different states and the
  potential interactions with other ions.
