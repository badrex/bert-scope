tldr: The author discusses the synthesis and properties of various peroxides of organic
  acids, including benzoyl, acetyl, nitro-benzoyl, cumenyl, butyl, and valeryl. They
  also investigate the reaction of barium peroxide with bibasic anhydrides, which
  have powerful oxidizing properties. The organic peroxides represent a new group
  of chemical substances with unique reactions, expanding our understanding of organic
  compounds and their analogies to inorganic substances.
