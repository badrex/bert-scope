tldr: John William Nicholson was a brilliant mathematician and physicist who made
  significant contributions to the understanding of atomic theory, spectroscopy, and
  the study of nebulae. His work on the coronal and nebular spectra led to the prediction
  of new spectral lines and the development of atomic models that later influenced
  the work of Bohr and his successors. Nicholson's research on the angular momentum
  of atoms and the introduction of Planck's constant in atomic models were groundbreaking
  and helped shape the field of quantum mechanics.
