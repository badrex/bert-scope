tldr: This article discusses the organization and evolution of genes, focusing on
  gene clusters and their implications for protein structure and function. The author
  highlights the importance of gene duplication and gene clusters in the evolution
  of new genetic functions and the flexibility of gene organization in higher eukaryotes.
  The article also explores the concept of structural DNA domains and their role in
  the formation of gene clusters and the evolution of protein sequences.
