tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the kinetics of muscle haemoglobin
  and its properties. They found that muscle haemoglobin has a hyperbolic dissociation
  curve and a faster rate of combination compared to blood haemoglobin. The study
  also showed that muscle haemoglobin satisfies the minimum postulates for a primitive
  respiratory pigment, making it an essential component in muscle function.
