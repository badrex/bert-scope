tldr: The authors present a method to incorporate time-history effects into the hydrodynamic
  representation of a ship's directional stability and control. By using a functional
  analysis, they show how to account for the time history of motion and improve the
  accuracy of the fluid components. This approach allows for a more comprehensive
  analysis of directional stability and control, leading to better understanding and
  design of ships.
