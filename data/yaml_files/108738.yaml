tldr: The author presents a comprehensive study of systems of linear indeterminate
  equations and congruences, focusing on matrices and determinants. They introduce
  concepts such as rectangular matrices, complementary types, and prime matrices,
  and explain how to find solutions to systems of equations using these tools. The
  author also discusses the importance of fundamental sets of solutions in the theory
  of linear indeterminate equations.
