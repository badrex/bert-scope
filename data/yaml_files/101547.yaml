tldr: Mr. Boyle proposed a series of experiments to study the effects of blood transfusion
  between animals. He questioned whether the temperament and abilities of animals
  could be altered by transferring blood from one animal to another. The experiments
  aimed to understand the impact of blood transfusion on animal behavior, health,
  and physical attributes. These trials laid the groundwork for future research in
  blood transfusion and medical experiments.
