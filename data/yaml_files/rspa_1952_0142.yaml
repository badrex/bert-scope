tldr: The article presents a perturbation method for solving Dirac's new electrodynamics,
  which cannot be solved using the conventional perturbation method. The method assumes
  that the charge is small, meaning the field created by the charge is neglected in
  the zero-order approximation. The author provides solutions for the simplified irrotational
  case and the general case with small vorticity, but the method does not work for
  cases with significant vorticity.
