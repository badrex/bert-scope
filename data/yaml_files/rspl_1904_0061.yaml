tldr: The authors investigated the solubility and conductivity of various organic
  compounds in liquefied hydrides of phosphorus, sulfur, and halogens. They found
  that many organic substances, such as amine salts, acid amides, and certain alkaloids,
  were readily soluble and formed conducting solutions. The molecular conductivity
  of these solutions increased with concentration, and the dissolved substances, rather
  than the halogen hydrides, carried the current, undergoing electrolytic dissociation.
