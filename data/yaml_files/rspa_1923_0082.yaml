tldr: The author presents a new explanation for osmotic effects and electrolysis,
  suggesting that these processes involve a system of three components, such as a
  voltaic couple. The author argues that the properties of aqueous solutions are determined
  by the interaction of these components, which include hydrone molecules, dissolved
  substances, and potential electrolytes. This explanation offers a simple, chemical-based
  understanding of osmotic phenomena and electrolysis, and it challenges the traditional
  view of water as a neutral substance.
