tldr: The authors studied the atomic structure and chemical composition of platinum
  surfaces using low energy electron diffraction and Auger electron spectroscopy.
  They found that the reactivity of low index and stepped platinum surfaces is different,
  with diatomic molecules adsorbing more readily on stepped surfaces. Organic molecules
  form ordered structures on low index faces but decompose rapidly on stepped surfaces.
  The dehydrocyclization of n-heptane occurs on stepped surfaces with specific atomic
  terraces, while the rate is slower on other surfaces. This research demonstrates
  the potential for studying catalytic reactions using single crystal surfaces with
  small surface areas.
