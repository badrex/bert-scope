tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats to study the effects of fat-soluble
  vitamin A deficiency on their blood platelets and resistance to infections. They
  discovered that a lack of vitamin A led to a significant decrease in blood platelets,
  making the rats more susceptible to infections. The researchers also found that
  the severity of this deficiency varied depending on the diet the rats received during
  infancy.
