tldr: The study investigates the proteins associated with contraction in lamellibranch
  muscles, specifically the striated and smooth adductor muscles of Pecten maximus.
  It discovers that the smooth muscle has a unique 'catch mechanism' that allows it
  to contract slowly and maintain the contraction with little energy expenditure.
  The research also reveals that the proteins associated with contraction in lamellibranch
  muscles include a conventional actomyosin and myosin in addition to tropomyosin
  A (TMA), which was previously thought to replace the classical contractile proteins
  in these muscles.
