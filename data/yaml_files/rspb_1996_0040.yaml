tldr: The authors use mathematical models to study the within-host dynamics of mycobacterial
  infections, focusing on the mechanisms that allow bacteria like Mycobacterium tuberculosis
  and Mycobacterium leprae to persist at low densities for extended periods. They
  suggest that slow growth rates or dormant stages may contribute to this persistence.
  The models also explore how long-term persistence can lead to the downregulation
  of the immune response, allowing bacteria to attain high densities. The authors
  propose experiments to test their models and discuss their implications for treating
  infected hosts.
