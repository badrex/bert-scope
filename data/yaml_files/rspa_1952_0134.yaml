tldr: This article presents measurements of the dielectric properties and radio-frequency
  absorption of pure polar liquids, specifically water, methyl, and ethyl alcohols.
  The authors used wave-guides to determine the absorption coefficients and refractive
  indices of these liquids at various temperatures and wavelengths. The results provide
  insights into the dielectric dispersion in polar liquids and contribute to the understanding
  of their properties.
