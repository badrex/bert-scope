tldr: The authors present a theory explaining the modulation observed in fluorescent
  light from atoms exposed to both optical and radio-frequency radiation. The optical
  field stimulates specific excited states, while the radio-frequency field establishes
  coherence between these states, leading to interference and modulation in the fluorescent
  radiation. The study focuses on the Zeeman structure of transitions in mercury and
  predicts modulation at various frequencies and resonant effects at specific magnetic
  fields.
