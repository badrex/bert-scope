tldr: This article examines two forms of comprehension impairment, semantic dementia
  and asyntactic comprehension, focusing on the assignment of thematic roles in sentence
  processing. The authors demonstrate that while syntactic information is sufficient
  for thematic assignment, semantic influences play a role in the process. They discuss
  the implications of these findings for current issues in sentence processing.
