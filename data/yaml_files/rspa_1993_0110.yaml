tldr: The author presents an electrochemical method to measure steady axial streaming
  near a rotating disc with torsional oscillations. The technique takes advantage
  of the disparate timescales for mass and momentum transfer, allowing for a more
  accurate measurement of steady axial streaming. The results of the experiments are
  discussed, and the potential extension of this technique to various self-similar
  flows is noted.
