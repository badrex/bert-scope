tldr: This article describes experiments conducted to determine the difference in
  the number of vibrations made by an invariable pendulum at the Royal Observatories
  of Greenwich and Altona. The author compares the results obtained at both locations
  and discusses the factors affecting the pendulum's rate, such as temperature and
  barometer readings.
