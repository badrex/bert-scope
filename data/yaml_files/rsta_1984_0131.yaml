tldr: The authors studied the behavior of sodium atoms in Fabry-Perot resonators under
  transverse magnetic fields. They observed optical bistability, tristability, and
  critical slowing-down, as well as magnetically induced self-pulsing. The experimental
  results were explained using a model by Kitano, Yabuzaki, and Ogawa, and the modified
  equations of motion were compared to experimental observations.
