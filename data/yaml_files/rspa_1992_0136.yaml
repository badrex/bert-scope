revised_title: Symmetry Operators for Maxwell's Equations on Curved Space-Time

- Conformal Killing Tensors
tldr: The authors derive necessary conditions for a second-order covariant differential
  operator to be a symmetry operator of Maxwell's equations in a general curved space-time
  background. They find that such operators are naturally formulated in terms of conformal
  Killing vectors, tensors, and spinors. These operators play a role in the solution
  of Maxwell's equations via separation of variables in the Kerr background space-time.
