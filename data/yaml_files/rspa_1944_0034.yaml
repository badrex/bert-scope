tldr: The authors investigate the initiation of long electrical discharges, focusing
  on the glow-arc transition theory of the first leader stroke in a lightning flash.
  They argue that this theory aligns with available observations, while the recombination
  theory does not. The study also highlights the importance of corona currents in
  these discharges and proposes a new theory for the stepped leader stroke.
