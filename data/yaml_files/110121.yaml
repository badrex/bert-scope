tldr: The author, Henry Hennell, studied the interaction between sulphuric acid and
  alcohol, leading to the discovery of a new compound. He found that when mixed with
  alcohol, a portion of the sulphuric acid combines with hydrocarbon, forming a new
  salt. This salt, called the "oil of wine," has unique properties and can be separated
  from the original mixture. Hennell's research sheds light on the composition and
  properties of these resulting compounds, expanding our understanding of acid-base
  reactions and organic chemistry.
