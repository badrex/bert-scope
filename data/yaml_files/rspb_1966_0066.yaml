tldr: Researchers studied hemoglobin variants in 202 irus macaques using starch-gel
  electrophoresis. They discovered two major hemoglobin variants, one that forms molecular
  aggregates and two minor components. The study found that the minor component may
  be the product of a mutated duplicate of the -locus. The researchers also discussed
  the population genetics of these variant hemoglobins and the possible role of simian
  malaria in their evolution.
