tldr: This study examines the social and non-social knowledge of free-ranging vervet
  monkeys in East Africa. Vervet monkeys are found to have a striking social knowledge,
  recognizing individuals, dominance relations, and kinship within their groups. However,
  they appear to know little about other aspects of their environment outside the
  social domain. The results support the view that primate intelligence has evolved
  mainly to solve social problems, making vervet monkeys excellent primatologists
  but poor naturalists.
