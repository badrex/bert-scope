tldr: This article discusses the life and work of William Rutherford, a significant
  yet overlooked figure in British physiology during the Victorian era. Rutherford
  made important contributions to the field, including research on the vagus nerve,
  bile secretion, and striated muscle, as well as being a pioneer in practical experimental
  physiology education. Despite his achievements, Rutherford's work and reputation
  were overshadowed by his contemporaries and the challenges he faced in his personal
  and professional life.
