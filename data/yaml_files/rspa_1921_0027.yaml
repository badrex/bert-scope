tldr: The author presents a generalisation of Weyl's geometry, removing an artificial
  restriction and simplifying the scheme. This new theory sheds light on the natural
  gauge system and its role in physics, providing a foundation for further development
  of physical theory. The author also introduces in-tensors and discusses their properties,
  which play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the continuum.
