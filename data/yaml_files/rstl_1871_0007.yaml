tldr: The author examines the formation of subaxial arches in the human skeleton,
  specifically focusing on the frontonasal, maxillary, mandibular, lingual, hyoid,
  laryngeal, and exoccipital arches. The study describes the development of these
  arches during the fifth to twelfth weeks of fetal life, detailing the changes in
  cartilage and membrane structures that contribute to the growth of the human skull
  and neck.
