tldr: The article demonstrates that spermatozoa produce an organic peroxide when incubated
  aerobically, leading to lipid peroxidation. This process may cause a decline in
  respiratory rate and motility, as well as structural damage to sperm membranes,
  which are early signs of sperm senescence and damage. The authors suggest that lipid
  peroxidation may be a cause of these issues in moribund spermatozoa.
