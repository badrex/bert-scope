tldr: This meeting discusses the challenges and potential improvements in exploiting
  remotely sensed imagery, focusing on the reasons for the delay in using satellite
  data, such as the disparity in funding, the difficulty in handling large amounts
  of data, and the communication gap between image-processing specialists and potential
  users. The meeting aims to explore ways to bridge these gaps and share experiences
  in using imagery in various fields.
