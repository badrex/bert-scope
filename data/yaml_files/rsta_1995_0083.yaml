tldr: This article explores two nonlinear mechanisms involved in boundary-layer transition.
  The first mechanism focuses on the generation of turbulent spots in flat-plate boundary
  layers, which occurs through the interaction of localized disturbances and Tollmien-Schlichting
  waves. The second mechanism examines the interaction of disturbances with mean flow
  and background perturbations in laminar boundary-layer separation regions, known
  as separation bubbles. The study reveals how these interactions can lead to the
  onset of turbulence and the transformation of laminar flows into turbulent ones.
