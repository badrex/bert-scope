tldr: The author, Joseph Prestwich, investigates the origin of loess deposits in the
  valleys of South England and France, connecting them to the formation of river valleys
  and fluviatile high and low-level gravels. He suggests that loess, high-level gravels,
  and low-level gravels were all formed by floodwaters, providing evidence of the
  magnitude of these floods and their erosive power. This explanation harmonizes with
  the hypothesis of greater water volume carried down by rivers in the past.
