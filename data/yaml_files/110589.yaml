tldr: Michael Faraday designed a new instrument called the Differential Inductometer
  to measure the inductive powers of various dielectrics. The instrument consists
  of three circular brass plates and two gold leaves suspended in a glass jar. By
  adjusting the size, distance, and positioning of the plates and leaves, Faraday
  aimed to create a versatile tool for studying the inductive properties of materials,
  including crystals and diamonds.
