tldr: The authors discovered that Kaloxylon, a previously thought to be an independent
  plant, is actually the root of Lyginodendron Oldhamium. They found specimens with
  the typical Kaloxylon structure in continuity with the stem of Lyginodendron, proving
  that they were adventitious roots. This discovery provides a complete understanding
  of Lyginodendron's vegetative organs, including its stem, foliage, and roots.
