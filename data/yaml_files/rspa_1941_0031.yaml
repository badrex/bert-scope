tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the hydrogen-oxygen reaction sensitized
  by nitrogen peroxide to study the effect of pressure, temperature, and foreign gases
  on the induction periods and explosion limits of the reaction. They found that increasing
  pressure causes the separation of the upper and lower limiting concentrations of
  the sensitizer to increase, and that all foreign gases lengthen the induction periods
  and eventually quench the ignition of the explosive mixture. The results provide
  insights into the mechanisms of chain reactions and the role of catalysts and inhibitors
  in controlling ignition.
