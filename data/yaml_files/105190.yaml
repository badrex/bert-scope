tldr: The author, John Landen, investigates several theorems related to circle geometry
  and their applications in resolving fractions with complex denominators. These theorems
  are useful in the field of calculus and can help simplify mathematical computations.
  Landen demonstrates how these theorems can be applied to various scenarios, including
  calculating the properties of circles and the values of trigonometric functions.
