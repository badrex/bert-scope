tldr: The authors detected a series of ultra-violet bands in the nitrogen afterglow,
  which they attributed to a compound of carbon and sulfur. They observed these bands
  in a carbon arc with a hollow carbon electrode charged with sulfur. The authors
  also studied the electric discharge through sulfur vapor and carbon disulfide vapor,
  analyzing the resulting spectra and comparing them to previous findings.
