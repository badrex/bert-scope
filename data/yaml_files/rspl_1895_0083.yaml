tldr: The authors investigated the nature of the vesicating constituent in croton
  oil, which is a mixture of fatty acids and glycerides. They found that the active
  substance is the glyceride of an acid called crotonoleic acid, which has vesicating
  properties. The authors attempted to obtain the pure compound and study its chemical
  constitution to understand the structure associated with the vesicating property,
  as no other fatty acid with a known constitution exhibits this characteristic.
