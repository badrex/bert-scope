tldr: The authors used interference bands and a microscope to measure the thickness
  and radius of curvature of a razor's cutting edge. They found that the edge's thickness
  could not be greater than 0.00001 inches and its radius of curvature could not be
  greater than 1/200,000 of an inch. This research demonstrates the extreme thinness
  of a cutting edge and the precision of optical methods for measuring small distances.
