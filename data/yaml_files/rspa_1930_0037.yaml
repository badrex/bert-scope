tldr: The author investigates the change of resistance in gold crystals at very low
  temperatures in a magnetic field. They discovered that the resistance increases
  as the square of the magnetic field, and in strong fields, it approaches a linear
  law. The author's hypothesis suggests that the disturbance produced by the structural
  imperfection of the lattice increases the specific resistance of an ideal metal
  by a value called the "additional resistance." This research supports the idea of
  supra-conductivity and provides insight into the behavior of metals under extreme
  conditions.
