revised_title: Concentration and Isolation of Heavy Constituents of the Atmosphere
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Gas separation
semantic_tags:
- Gas separation
- Atmospheric gases
- Rare gases
- Liquid air
- Phosphorus absorption
tldr: The authors describe a method to concentrate and isolate heavy constituents
  of the atmosphere, such as krypton and xenon, using liquid air and phosphorus absorption.
  They successfully concentrated these gases from large amounts of air, paving the
  way for further research on rare gases in the atmosphere.
