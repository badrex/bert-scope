tldr: The author examines the structure of the brain in rodents, focusing on the cerebral
  cortex and the olfactory system. They identify various types of cortex and analyze
  the distribution of ganglionic formations and the central projections of the olfactory
  medulla. The study provides insights into the differences between the brains of
  rodents and humans, as well as the significance of sulci and fissures in structurally
  differentiated realms of the cortex.
