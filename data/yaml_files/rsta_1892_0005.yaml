tldr: The author investigates the locus of singular points and lines in the intersections
  of a system of surfaces. They extend previous work on the subject to include rational
  and integral functions of coordinates and parameters. The study focuses on the cases
  where there is one or two independent parameters and provides insights into the
  properties of the envelope locus, conic nodes, and binodal lines.
