tldr: The author reinvestigates the essential oil of rue and its aldehyde derivatives,
  discovering that the oil contains an aldehyde of the formula C22H22O2, which they
  named enodic aldehyde. This finding challenges the previously held beliefs about
  the composition of the oil and its derivatives.
