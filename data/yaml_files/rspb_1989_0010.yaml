tldr: This study compares the competitive responses of Atlantic salmon adopting different
  life-history strategies. The research shows that slow-developing salmon have a higher
  failure rate in competing for food when faced with a competitor, while fast-developing
  salmon remain unaffected. The findings suggest that slow-developing salmon may have
  a disadvantage in terms of survival and growth due to their lower competitive ability.
