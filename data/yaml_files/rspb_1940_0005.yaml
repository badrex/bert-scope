tldr: This article investigates the role of calcium in blood coagulation. The authors
  found that calcium plays a crucial role in the coagulation process, and its absence
  prevents coagulation. They also discovered that calcium does not combine with fibrinogen
  in the formation of fibrin, and it may accelerate the action of thrombase on fibrinogen.
  The study provides insights into the complex relationship between calcium and blood
  coagulation, which is essential for understanding blood clotting and its disorders.
