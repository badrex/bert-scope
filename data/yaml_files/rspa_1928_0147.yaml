tldr: This article presents observations of the height of the ozone layer in the upper
  atmosphere over Arosa, Switzerland. The authors found that the height of the ozone
  layer appears to increase between autumn and spring, which corresponds to the increase
  in the average amount of ozone during this time. The study also suggests that the
  height of the ozone layer is greater when the amount of ozone is greater, indicating
  a connection between the amount of ozone and its height in the atmosphere.
