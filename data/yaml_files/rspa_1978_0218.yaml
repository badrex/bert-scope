tldr: The article explores the variation of X-ray Bragg reflexion properties in perfect
  crystals based on geometrical factors such as thickness and degree of asymmetry.
  The study uses direct numerical evaluation of the dynamical theory to demonstrate
  the zero-level-of-interaction limit for both finite and infinite-thickness perfect
  crystals. The findings reveal that integrated reflectivity can exceed that of the
  corresponding semi-infinite crystal and can even surpass that of an ideally mosaic
  crystal in certain cases, leading to the phenomenon of negative extinction.
