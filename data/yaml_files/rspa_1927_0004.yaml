tldr: The authors studied magnetic double-refraction in benzene and its derivatives
  using the Langevin theory. They found that benzene exhibits a remarkable magnetic
  anisotropy, with the susceptibility in the direction of the axis being about twice
  as large as in perpendicular directions. The study also suggests that at least 12
  of the electron orbits binding the atoms in the molecule must be orientated in a
  plane parallel to the ring. This research helps to understand the relationship between
  chemical structure and magnetic anisotropy in carbon compounds.
