tldr: This study examines the species-area relationship in Caribbean anoline lizards
  and finds that ecological and evolutionary factors play different roles in determining
  species number on islands of varying sizes. On small islands, ecological factors
  such as colonization, competition, and extinction are the main drivers, while on
  larger islands, evolutionary factors become more important. The authors also discover
  that the number of habitat niches occupied and the distribution of closely related
  species play a significant role in the species-area relationship in the Greater
  Antilles.
