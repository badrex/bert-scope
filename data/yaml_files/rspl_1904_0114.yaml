tldr: The authors investigate the chemical combination and toxic action of different
  complements and immune-bodies in hemolytic sera. They find that the highest dosage
  of complement occurs when used against its own corpuscles, and the immune-body's
  dose with rabbit's complement is the same as with guinea-pig's complement when acting
  on ox's corpuscles. The study supports the idea that complement's toxic action plays
  a significant role in hemolysis.
