tldr: The authors measured the vapour pressures of benzene solutions of diphenyl,
  diphenylmethane, and dibenzyl over the temperature range of 25 to 75Â°C. They observed
  small deviations from Raoult's law and calculated activity coefficients after correcting
  the data for benzene vapour imperfections. The results were compared with theoretical
  equations deduced by Orr and Guggenheim for mixtures of monomers and dimers. The
  study provides insights into the thermodynamics of hydrocarbon solutions and helps
  test statistical-mechanical theories.
