tldr: The author presents a comprehensive method for the numerical solution of rectangular
  plate problems under various loadings and boundary conditions. The method involves
  obtaining a particular integral as a double Fourier sine series and summing it to
  a highly convergent single series. This approach is suitable for programming on
  an electronic computer and can be applied to various types of loads, including concentrated
  and distributed loads.
