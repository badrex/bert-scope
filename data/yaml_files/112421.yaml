tldr: The author explains how free hydrochloric acid is secreted in the gastric juice.
  They propose that the pressure and osmosis in the blood capillaries cause the corpuscles
  to release acid contents, which mix with the plasma and pass through the stomach's
  gastric tubules. This process, combined with dialysis, leads to the formation of
  free hydrochloric acid in the stomach, which plays a crucial role in digestion.
