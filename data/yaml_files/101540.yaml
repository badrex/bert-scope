tldr: The author describes a Swedish stone that can be heated to produce sulfur, vitriol,
  alum, and minium. The stone is found in Sweden and is similar to a stone found in
  the North of England, which produces the same substances except for minium. The
  process of extracting these substances involves heating, melting, and cooling the
  stone in various containers and with different materials.
