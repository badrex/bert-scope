tldr: The article discusses the importance of understanding the diet of early hominids
  in the context of human evolution. The author presents various methods to determine
  extinct hominids' diets, focusing on the analysis of tooth microwear. By examining
  the microwear patterns on fossil hominid teeth, certain diets that have been proposed
  for them can be ruled out. This research helps to refine dietary hypotheses and
  better understand the dietary adaptations of our ancestors.
