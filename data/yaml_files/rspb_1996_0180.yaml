tldr: The article investigates a patient with a unilateral focal brain lesion who
  has a permanent disorder in perceiving second-order motion but not first-order motion
  in their contralateral visual field. This finding suggests that separate pathways
  for motion perception exist, either as divergent pathways from area MT or even from
  primary visual cortex, or as separate pathways from subcortical areas to extrastriate
  visual areas.
