tldr: The authors conducted a direct electron microscope study of defect clusters
  in alkali halides caused by ionizing radiation. They developed a technique to prepare
  thin foils of alkali halide crystals for observation in the microscope and used
  a liquid helium cooled stage to study irradiated crystals at low temperatures. The
  study provides evidence for efficient interstitial clustering in alkali halides
  and discusses the size, growth behavior, and morphology of these clusters.
