tldr: The author, William Barlow, explains the historical analogy between English
  weights and measures, showing how they were once based on a common standard. He
  discusses the origins of the ton, hogshead, and other units, and how their original
  relationship has been lost over time, leading to confusion and inconsistency in
  measurements.
