tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the identity of spectral lines
  exhibited by different elements using a reflecting grating and a spectroscope. They
  found that some lines were coincident or close together, and they resolved and identified
  several lines in iron, titanium, and other elements. This research helped to better
  understand the properties and characteristics of various elements.
