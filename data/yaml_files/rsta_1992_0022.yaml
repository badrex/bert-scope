tldr: The article discusses the use of mathematical techniques and formal program
  specification in the design of microprocessors. The authors describe their experience
  with a formally verified version of a floating-point package, which was used in
  the design of the T800 microprocessor. They also introduce the Occam transformation
  system, which helps in transforming and verifying programs, ensuring their correctness
  and efficiency.
