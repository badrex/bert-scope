tldr: The author discusses the results of the Royal Society expedition to the British
  Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1965, focusing on the orchid flora of the region.
  They collected and documented 350 orchid gatherings, with 230 species identified.
  About 90 of these species are apparently endemic, and 70 of them are new to science.
  The author highlights the need for further exploration and collecting in adjacent
  island groups to determine the true endemism of these species. The orchid flora
  of the Solomon Islands is divided into four distinct types based on habitat, with
  a higher proportion of endemics found in the true rainforest species.
