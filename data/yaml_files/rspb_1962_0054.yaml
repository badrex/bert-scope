tldr: The authors studied the nucleo-cytoplasmic control of perithecial formation
  in the fungus Aspergillus nidulans. They discovered that a spontaneous mutant colony,
  alba, has a cytoplasmic factor that affects perithecial formation. The alba colony
  has a different cytoplasmic unit that can be transferred through hyphal fusion,
  allowing the colony to produce perithecia. The authors also found a self-sterile
  mutant that controls perithecial density and a nuclear gene that determines self-sterility.
