tldr: This article explores the relative merits of Fourier transform spectrometers
  and alternative passive spectrometers, focusing on the quantity, quality, and cost
  of information flow. It compares the techniques of Fourier transform spectrometry,
  grating spectrographs, and Fabry-Perot interferometers, discussing their throughput,
  detector considerations, spectral coverage, resolution, accuracy in intensity and
  wavelength, and cost of construction and data reduction.
