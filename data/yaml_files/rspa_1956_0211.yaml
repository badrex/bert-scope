tldr: The authors conducted a systematic study of fourteen diallyl ester monomers
  to investigate the intramolecular reaction mechanisms in addition polymerization
  systems. They observed intramolecular reaction in all cases and found two types
  that could be distinguished and quantitatively estimated. The results support the
  theory that the tendency of a monomer to cyclize is largely controlled by the distance
  between polymerizable groups. The study provides insights into the structure and
  behavior of polyfunctional systems in polymer chemistry.
