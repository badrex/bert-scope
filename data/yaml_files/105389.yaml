tldr: Nicolas Munckley observed a comet in the sky near the constellation of Orion
  in 1760. He described its location, appearance, and movement over several nights.
  Although he could not observe the comet for a longer period due to cloudy weather,
  his account provides valuable information about early modern astronomical observations.
