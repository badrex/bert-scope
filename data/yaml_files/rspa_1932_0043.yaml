tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the state of water in gelatin
  gels. They found that the amount of water associated with each gram of dry gelatin
  increases rapidly as the water's activity approaches unity. The results show that
  the behavior of gelatin gel depends on the direct interaction between gelatin and
  water, and the freezing equilibrium curve is independent of the rate of cooling.
