tldr: The authors studied the trypanosome causing disease in humans in Nyasaland and
  found a naturally infected dog strain with distinct morphological and infectious
  characteristics. They observed that the strain was almost harmless to monkeys and
  guinea-pigs, and its morphology differed from the parent species. The study highlights
  the importance of understanding the variations in trypanosome species and their
  impact on disease transmission and virulence.
