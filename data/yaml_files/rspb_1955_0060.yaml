tldr: The study investigates the development of bacterial colonies of Bacterium lactis
  aerogenes on agar plates containing drugs. The researchers found that the rate of
  colony development for trained and untrained strains of bacteria varied, suggesting
  that adaptation to the drug may occur through competition between adaptive and lethal
  processes rather than the presence of pre-existing resistant mutants. The findings
  support the idea that survival on a drug plate is influenced by various factors,
  not just spontaneous mutations.
