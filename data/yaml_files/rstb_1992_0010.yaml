tldr: The article discusses the extraction and use of facial features in low bit-rate
  visual communication. The authors review their experimental investigations into
  methods of extracting binary features from images of faces and hands to enable deaf
  people to communicate using sign language over telephone networks. They describe
  the theoretical postulates underlying the successful extraction of facial features
  and the operators used for feature extraction. The article also explores the potential
  applications of facial feature extraction in visual communication, facial recognition
  systems, and model-based image coding.
