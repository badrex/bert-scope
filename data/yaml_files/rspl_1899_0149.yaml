tldr: The author investigates the electrical effects of light on green leaves and
  the contact sensitiveness of various substances to electric radiation. They discover
  that some substances, like potassium, show an increase in resistance during electric
  wave impacts, while others exhibit a decrease in resistance. This study helps differentiate
  between positive and negative actions of radiation and highlights the importance
  of understanding the nature of sensitive substances.
