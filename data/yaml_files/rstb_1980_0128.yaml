tldr: The study investigates the functional and adaptive morphology of six deep-sea
  species of the genus Limopsis from the Atlantic. These species exhibit changes in
  their byssate habits, shell size, and structure, which are related to their environment
  and feeding mechanisms. The research also discusses the taxonomy and internal anatomy
  of these species, providing insights into their adaptation to deep-sea life.
