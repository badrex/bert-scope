tldr: The author re-examined the light scattered by gases in terms of polarization
  and conducted experiments on common gases. They improved the experimental methods
  to obtain more accurate results, confirming earlier investigations. The study focused
  on the permanent gases and used a broader beam of light to observe deeper layers
  of gas, which helped in understanding the polarization properties of scattered light.
