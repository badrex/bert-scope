tldr: The author discusses the importance of considering the weight of a ship's material,
  such as iron armor, when designing iron-clad ships. They argue that the proportions
  and forms of ships should be adjusted based on the weight of their armor, and that
  adopting a form of greater resistance can lead to increased efficiency and economy.
  The author provides examples of different ship designs and compares their dimensions,
  weight, and performance.
