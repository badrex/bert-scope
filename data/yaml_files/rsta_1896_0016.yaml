tldr: The author, Major P. A. MacMahon, explores the theory of partitioning numbers
  and the connections between unipartite and multipartite partitions. He introduces
  the concept of separation of partitions and its importance in the theory of symmetric
  functions. The article also discusses the graphical representation of compositions
  and partitions, focusing on Sylvester's method and its application to bipartite
  numbers.
