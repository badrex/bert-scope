tldr: The author discusses the various methods used to measure the Earth's density,
  such as the Schellnhoff or Iuttonian method, the Cavendish experiment, and the pendulum
  experiment. They argue that the Cavendish experiment provides the most accurate
  results, as it deals with known disturbing masses, while the other methods have
  significant errors due to unknown factors. The author also suggests improvements
  for future pendulum experiments to reduce errors.
