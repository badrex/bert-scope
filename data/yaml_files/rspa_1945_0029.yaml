tldr: This article investigates the age and election trends of the Royal Society Fellowship
  between 1899 and 1943. It shows that the average age of elected fellows has been
  steadily increasing, and the mortality rates of older fellows have been heavier
  in the latter part of the period. The article also discusses the future size and
  age constitution of the Royal Society, forecasting different scenarios based on
  the number and ages of future successful candidates for the Fellowship.
