tldr: The author, Augustus William Hofmann, examines the phosphorus-bases and their
  chemical reactions. He discovers a new compound, the oxide of the phosphorus-base,
  which forms when the phosphorus-base is exposed to the air. The author confirms
  the compound's formula through analysis and discusses its properties and formation.
  This oxide has potential applications in the study of phosphorus compounds and their
  reactions.
