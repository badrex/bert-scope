tldr: The author examines the formation of definite figures by the deposition of dust,
  discussing experiments conducted by Dr. W. J. Russell. The author finds that dust-free
  layers of air protect surfaces from dust deposition, while deposition occurs where
  air currents are disrupted or slowed down. This study contributes to understanding
  the behavior of air currents and dust deposition in the atmosphere.
