tldr: This article discusses the development and use of invar wire lever type Earth
  strain meters in New Zealand to detect possible strain changes before earthquakes.
  The authors describe their findings on the effects of wind and rain on the strain
  meters and the challenges of interpreting the data. Although no earthquake precursors
  were detected, the study provides valuable insights into the potential of these
  strain meters for future earthquake prediction methods.
