tldr: The author presents a nonlinear stability analysis of intermediate baroclinic
  flow on a sloping bottom using a non-canonical Hamiltonian system. The study focuses
  on the dynamics of mesoscale gravity currents and coupled density fronts, providing
  a variational principle that describes arbitrary steady solutions. The author establishes
  two formal stability theorems that can establish the linear stability in the sense
  of Liapunov of these steady solutions and derives two a priori estimates that bound
  the disturbance energy and the Liapunov norm.
