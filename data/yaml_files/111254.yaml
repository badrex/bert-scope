tldr: This study compares the acidity, sweetness, and alcohol content of various wines,
  beers, and spirits. The author determines the acidity by neutralizing a standard
  solution of caustic soda and measures sweetness using a saccharometer. The alcohol
  content is determined using an alcoholometer. The results provide an order of wines
  and drinks based on their acidity, sweetness, and strength, which can be useful
  for dietary considerations.
