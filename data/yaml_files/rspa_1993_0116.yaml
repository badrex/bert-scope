tldr: The author calculates the central charge from the second moment of the spin-spin
  correlation function in the two-dimensional Ising model. They develop high field
  expansions and use series extrapolation methods to estimate the central charge,
  which is related to the amplitude for the divergence of the spin-spin correlation
  function at the critical point.
