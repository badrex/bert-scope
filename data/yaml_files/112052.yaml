tldr: The author conducted 20 experiments during the summer of 1863 to study spontaneous
  generation using different gases and substances like milk and meat. The experiments
  were performed in glass bulbs filled with air, carbonic acid, hydrogen, oxygen,
  and nitrogen gases. The results showed that low organisms were found in most cases,
  except when meat was enclosed in a bulb filled with nitrogen. This study contributed
  to the understanding of the conditions required for the development of organic life.
