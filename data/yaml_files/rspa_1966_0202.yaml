tldr: The authors investigate the self-consistency problems of massless particles
  with arbitrary spin when coupled to electromagnetic and gravitational fields. They
  use a group theoretic method to analyze the interactions and find that it is impossible
  for massless particles of unique spin to be coupled minimally to gravitation unless
  the spin is less than S, space-time is conformally flat, or the spin is two and
  it describes gravitational radiation.
