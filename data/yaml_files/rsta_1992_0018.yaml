tldr: This article explores the use of chaotic advection in engineering systems, specifically
  in cellular flows, to enhance transport processes such as heat transfer. The authors
  discuss various examples, including closed cavity flows, jet-induced flows, and
  flows down a backward step, and analyze the effects of chaotic advection on these
  systems. They also propose future research directions and potential applications
  of chaos-enhanced transport in engineering.
