tldr: This article presents a criterion for the development of the full plastic moment
  at one end of a uniform strut prior to instability. The authors analyze the plastic
  design methods for structures and provide a modified theory that avoids certain
  objections by including an additional criterion. They also discuss the effects of
  loading and the assumptions made in the analysis.
