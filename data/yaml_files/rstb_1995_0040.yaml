tldr: The article discusses the process of mapping protein folding pathways by determining
  the structures of transition states and intermediates. The authors use a combination
  of protein engineering and nuclear magnetic resonance methods to analyze the folding
  pathways of barnase and chymotrypsin inhibitor 2. They find that barnase folds according
  to a framework model, while chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 folds without a kinetically
  significant intermediate. The protein engineering method is also used to study the
  effects of molecular chaperones on folding pathways.
