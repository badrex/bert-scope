tldr: The author explores properties of prime numbers, focusing on Wilson's Theorem,
  Gauss's Theorem, and Fermat's Theorem. He demonstrates how these theorems are interconnected
  and can be extended to include various prime-related properties. Additionally, the
  author shows that the law of reciprocity of prime numbers is a corollary of his
  theorem.
