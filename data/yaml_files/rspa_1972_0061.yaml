tldr: The authors measured the five single-crystal elastic constants of dysprosium
  and holmium within the temperature range of 4.2 to 300 K. They eliminated spurious
  contributions from domain reorientation effects by applying a magnetic field along
  the magnetically easy direction. The results indicate large magnetic contributions
  to the elastic constants, which can be interpreted as arising from the strain dependence
  of the exchange energy. This study helps in understanding the properties of heavy
  rare earth metals and their potential applications.
