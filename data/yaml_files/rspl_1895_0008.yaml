tldr: In this article, J. Norman Lockyer and C. B. F. R. S. study a new gas obtained
  from uraninite and its relation to helium. They discover that the gas has lines
  in the spectrum similar to those found in the sun's chromosphere, suggesting a connection
  to the gas responsible for solar phenomena. The author also mentions the possibility
  of obtaining other new gases using the same method.
