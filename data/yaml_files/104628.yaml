tldr: In this letter, Leonard Euler discusses the gradual approach of the Earth to
  the Sun, which he believes is caused by the resistance the Earth experiences in
  its motion. He also explains that this phenomenon implies that the Solar System
  cannot last forever and must have had a beginning and an end. Euler hopes to find
  more older observations to determine how much the years become shorter in each century.
