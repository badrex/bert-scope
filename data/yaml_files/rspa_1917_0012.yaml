tldr: This article examines the magnetic storm of August 22, 1916, and its effects
  on the Earth's magnetic field. The author discusses the complexity of magnetic changes
  during storms and the challenges in studying them. They analyze the magnetic disturbances
  at various stations and propose different types of disturbances, such as oscillations
  and rotations in the disturbance vector. The author also investigates the relationship
  between the magnetic changes and the occurrence of auroras.
