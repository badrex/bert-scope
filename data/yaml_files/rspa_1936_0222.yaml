tldr: This article investigates the efficiency of emission of series fluorescent radiation
  from xenon and krypton using an expansion chamber. A statistical analysis of tracks
  resulted in efficiency values of 20% for xenon and 8% for krypton. The results are
  compared with previous workers' findings.
