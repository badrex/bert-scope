tldr: This biographical memoir recounts the life and achievements of Francis Rex Parrington,
  a renowned vertebrate palaeontologist and comparative anatomist. Parrington made
  significant contributions to the field, including his research on various vertebrate
  classes and his establishment of a thriving research school in the Zoology Department
  at Cambridge. His passion for natural history and paleontology began at a young
  age, and he went on to participate in important paleontological expeditions, such
  as those to Tendaguru in Tanganyika and the South African Karoo. Parrington's work
  and influence continue to be felt in the field of vertebrate paleontology today.
