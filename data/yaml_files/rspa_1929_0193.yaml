tldr: This article investigates the turbulent wake behind a body of revolution in
  a fluid stream. The author presents a method of successive approximations to determine
  the boundary of the turbulent region and the components of velocity within it. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of turbulent wakes and their implications
  for fluid dynamics and aerodynamics.
