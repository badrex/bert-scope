tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cows to study the precursors of milk fat
  and other milk constituents in their blood. They found that blood sugar, fatty acids,
  and inorganic phosphorus showed significant changes when passing through the mammary
  gland, suggesting that these components play a role in milk synthesis. The results
  provide insights into the origin of milk fat and other milk constituents, which
  can help improve our understanding of dairy production and nutrition.
