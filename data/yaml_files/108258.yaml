tldr: The author, William Rutherford, computed the ratio of a circle's diameter to
  its circumference to 208 decimal places using a series of mathematical formulas
  and tables. He employed a simplified process of division and combined three series
  to achieve this level of accuracy. The result was a more precise approximation than
  previous methods, which had only reached up to 152 decimal places.
