tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the spontaneous crystallization of binary
  mixtures, specifically salol and betol. They determined the temperature of spontaneous
  crystallization by tracing the supersolubility curve and observed multiple freezing
  points in the mixtures. The study provides insights into the process of crystallization
  in alloys and other mixtures, contributing to the understanding of their freezing
  points and solidification behavior.
