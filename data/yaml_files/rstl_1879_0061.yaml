tldr: The author investigates the consequences of considering the Earth's interior
  as viscous or imperfectly elastic, and how this affects the ocean tides. They analyze
  the equilibrium tide theory and apply it to estimate the reduction and alteration
  of ocean tides due to bodily tides. The study concludes that the results are as
  hostile to the idea of any great mobility of the Earth's interior as Sir William
  Thomson's work, suggesting that the solid crust cannot repress tidal surges if the
  interior is not rigid enough.
