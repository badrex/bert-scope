tldr: The authors investigated the ionization of helium by neutral helium atoms and
  found that ionization begins when the kinetic energy of the bombarding atoms is
  twice the minimum energy required for electrons to ionize helium. They used a sensitive
  detecting instrument and controlled the kinetic energy of the neutral helium atoms
  to study the effects of atomic collisions.
