tldr: Anth Van Leuwenhoek examines the dental grit and finds a variety of small animalcules,
  some moving like eels and others turning like tops. He also investigates the scaleyness
  of the skin, discovering that the upper part of the skin is made up of tiny scales
  similar to fish scales, which help to protect and shed the skin. He concludes that
  there are no pores in the upper skin, and the moisture is expelled between the scales.
