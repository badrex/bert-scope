tldr: The article discusses the role of molecular chaperones in protein folding within
  the cell. It compares the folding process in vitro and in vivo, highlighting the
  differences in kinetics and the involvement of accessory proteins. The author also
  explains the role of protein disulphide isomerase in catalyzing the disulphide exchange
  reaction and the importance of molecular chaperones in preventing misfolding and
  aggregation of proteins.
