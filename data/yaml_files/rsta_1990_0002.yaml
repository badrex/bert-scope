tldr: The authors investigate the dissolution of calcite in aqueous solutions at pH
  greater than 7 using a flow cell experimental method. They develop a numerical computational
  method to model the dissolution kinetics and analyze the surface concentrations
  of reactants, which helps in understanding the mechanism of calcite dissolution
  under high pH conditions.
