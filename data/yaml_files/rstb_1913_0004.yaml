tldr: This study investigates the effects of stimulating and removing the labyrinth
  of the ear on the motor system. The researchers found that stimulating the end organ
  of the vestibular nerve and destroying the labyrinth or eighth nerve can cause disturbances
  in motor coordination, eye movements, and sensations of rotation. These findings
  contribute to understanding the connection between the labyrinth and eye muscles,
  as well as the path of the vestibular-optic pathway.
