tldr: This article discusses the results of tide observations at various locations
  along the British and neighboring coasts. The author finds that the curve of high
  water heights is nearly the same at all these places, and that the equilibrium theory
  accurately predicts the form of the curve. The author also notes that the ratio
  of lunar to solar tides varies depending on the location and the size of the tide,
  and that the mean water level is generally lower than previously thought.
