tldr: The authors present a computational theory for visual surface interpolation,
  discussing the conditions for a unique family of surfaces that best fit through
  known points. They consider two possible functionals, the square Laplacian and the
  quadratic variation, and explore the interpolation problem as a thin elastic plate
  fitting process.
