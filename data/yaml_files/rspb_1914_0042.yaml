tldr: The author investigates the presence of inorganic iron compounds in chloroplasts
  of green plant cells, relating it to natural photosynthesis and the origin of life.
  They demonstrate that colloidal iron solutions, in the presence of dissolved carbon
  dioxide and sunlight, can synthesize formaldehyde, a crucial step in the process
  of organic synthesis. This suggests that life may have originated through the development
  of more complex organic substances from this simple beginning.
