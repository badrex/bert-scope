tldr: The authors studied the electronic properties of synthetic metals derived from
  graphite, specifically focusing on alkali metal intercalates with the approximate
  composition C8K, C8Rb, and C8Cs. They found that these materials exhibit n-type
  behavior as metallic conductors, with carbon-hexagon networks acting as macro-anions.
  The temperature coefficient of electrical resistance was measured for these materials,
  providing insights into their electronic properties and confirming their metallic
  conductor nature.
