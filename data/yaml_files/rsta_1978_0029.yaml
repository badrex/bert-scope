tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the solubility of alumina in
  enstatite and its impact on estimated palaeogeotherms. They found that the equilibrium
  solubility of alumina in enstatite is lower than previous studies, leading to uncertainties
  in estimated palaeogeotherms. This may result in spurious kinks in the apparent
  geotherms, affecting the estimation of pressures and temperatures of mineral assemblages
  in rocks.
