tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, examines the spectra of gases obtained from various
  minerals, including uraninite, and discovers new gases that may be present in the
  sun and stars. These gases could have significant implications for celestial chemistry
  and the correlation between terrestrial and celestial phenomena.
