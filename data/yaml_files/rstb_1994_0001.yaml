tldr: This article highlights the importance of understanding the interaction between
  physical and biological scales in marine and terrestrial ecosystems. It emphasizes
  that the emphasis on internal mechanisms in terrestrial studies and external physical
  forcing in marine populations can provide a partial description of the diverse temporal
  patterns observed. The article suggests that the coupling between different scales,
  rather than the nature of internal or external processes themselves, can help explain
  the variety of patterns found in both marine and terrestrial systems.
