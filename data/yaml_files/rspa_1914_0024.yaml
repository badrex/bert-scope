tldr: This article investigates the variation of sodium's specific heat in solid and
  liquid states and determines its latent heat of fusion. The authors used a controlled
  environment and precise measurements to understand how the specific heat changes
  with temperature. Their findings provide a better understanding of sodium's thermal
  properties and contribute to the knowledge of materials science.
