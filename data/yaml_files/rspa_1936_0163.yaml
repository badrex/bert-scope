tldr: The author presents a rigorous and exact expression for the total mechanical
  reaction on a sphere in spinless rectilinear motion, with a speed always less than
  the speed of light. The expression includes the electromagnetic mass term, radiation
  pressure term, and higher-order terms related to the sphere's radius. The author
  applies this expression to cases of continuous uniform acceleration and hyperbolic
  rectilinear motion.
