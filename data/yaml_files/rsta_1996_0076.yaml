tldr: This article investigates the possibility of a low-dimensional characterization
  of atmospheric temperature data, focusing on daily maximum and minimum temperature
  records spanning about 70 years. The authors explore various methods, including
  global and local singular value decompositions, to analyze the data and determine
  if a low-dimensional representation is feasible. They conclude that a low-dimensional
  characterization of the temperature data is unlikely, highlighting the challenges
  in understanding and predicting weather and climate systems.
