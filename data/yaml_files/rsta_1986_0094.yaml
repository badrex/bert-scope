tldr: This article discusses the various pathways and scenarios for radionuclide releases
  from land disposal sites, focusing on the transport of radionuclides through the
  environment and the potential risks to humans. The authors review the types of releases,
  mathematical models used for radionuclide transport, and the challenges in predicting
  future environmental conditions. They also describe the structure and components
  of a compartment model, such as the bios model, used to assess the potential radiological
  impact on humans.
