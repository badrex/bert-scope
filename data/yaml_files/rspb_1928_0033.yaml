tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the recovery heat-production in
  oxygen after a series of muscle twitches. They found a mean ratio of oxidative to
  anaerobic heat of 2.07, which led to an "oxidative quotient" of 4.81. This value
  is close to the latest determination made by Meyerhof and Schulz using a different
  method. The results suggest that lactic acid plays a significant role in the theory
  of muscular contraction.
