tldr: Robert Robinson was a prominent biochemist known for his work on phosphoric
  esters and their role in yeast fermentation. He discovered the hexosemonophosphate,
  or Robison ester, which became a crucial substrate for studying carbohydrate metabolism
  in animal tissues. Additionally, Robinson made significant contributions to understanding
  the process of ossification through his research on bone mineralization.
