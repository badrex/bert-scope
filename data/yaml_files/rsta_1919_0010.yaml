tldr: The authors conducted a detailed magnetic and geological survey of the Melton
  Mowbray district in Leicestershire and Irthlingborough in Northamptonshire to understand
  the relationship between magnetic disturbances and the distribution of iron ores.
  They discovered that the amount of disturbance is not directly related to the amount
  of iron present, and that the magnetic susceptibility of rocks plays a significant
  role in the disturbances. The study aimed to determine the origin of local magnetic
  disturbances and their connection with iron-ore deposits.
