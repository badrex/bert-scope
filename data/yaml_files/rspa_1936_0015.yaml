tldr: The authors investigated the electrical resistance of aluminium at low temperatures,
  specifically in the liquid helium region. They used high-purity aluminium samples
  and found that the resistance of the metal decreased as the temperature decreased,
  with a significant drop at liquid helium temperatures. This research contributed
  to the understanding of superconductivity in metals.
