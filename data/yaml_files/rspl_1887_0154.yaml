tldr: The authors studied the development of the skeleton and olfactory structures
  in the Apteryx, a bird with reptilian characteristics. They observed seven stages
  before hatching and provided detailed descriptions of the skull's structure, including
  the olfactory capsules, turbinals, and the presence of vestigial cartilage of Jacobson's
  organ. This research contributes to the understanding of the morphology and evolution
  of archaic bird types.
