  Approach'

tldr: The author develops a theory of solutions based on a simple relation between
  vapour-pressure and concentration, which effectively explains the phenomena observed
  in strong solutions. The theory also demonstrates that any two solutions in equilibrium
  must have the same vapour-pressures in respect of each of their constituents capable
  of passing through the surface of separation.
