tldr: This article examines the evolution of the northwest African continental margin,
  focusing on the Mesozoic-Cainozoic subsidence history and palaeobathymetry. The
  authors use data from deep drilling and seismic profiles to study the structure
  and stratigraphy of the continental margin, providing insights into the geodynamic
  evolution of this rifted margin.
