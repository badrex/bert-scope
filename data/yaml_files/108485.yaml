tldr: The author examines the dental tissues of marsupial animals, focusing on the
  unique structure of their enamel. They discovered that the enamel in marsupial teeth
  has a high degree of tubularity, with dentinal tubes extending into the enamel.
  This is a distinct characteristic that sets marsupial teeth apart from other mammalian
  teeth. The author also notes differences in enamel structure and dental tissue composition
  between incisor and molar teeth in various marsupial species.
