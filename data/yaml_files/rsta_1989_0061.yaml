tldr: This article discusses various optical time-switching systems for wideband local
  networks, focusing on time-division multiple access (TDMA) and spectral-division
  multiple access (SDMA) techniques. The author reviews different implementations
  of TDMA, such as bit-multiplexing, block-multiplexing, and code-division multiplexing,
  and explores the potential of SDMA, including wavelength-division multiple access
  (WDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). The article also highlights
  the challenges of synchronizing incoming data and the need for efficient switching
  systems in optical networks.
