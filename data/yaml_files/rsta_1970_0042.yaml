tldr: The author discusses the evolution of volcanism and tectonic activity in the
  Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and Ethiopian rifts. They analyze the different types of
  magmatic products and the style of deformation in these regions, which are related
  to the regional tectonic history and volcanic evolution. The study reveals that
  the type of magmatic product can be correlated with the style of deformation, with
  alkali basalts being associated with vertical uplift, and zones of crustal attenuation
  hosting volcanic activity characterized by peralkali silicic differentiates.
