tldr: The author explains the forces caused by evaporation and condensation at a surface
  using the kinetic theory of gases. They demonstrate that evaporation creates a force
  that pushes the surface back, while condensation creates a force that pulls the
  surface forward. The experiments show that these effects are due to the change in
  pressure caused by the molecules of the liquid or gas interacting with the surface.
