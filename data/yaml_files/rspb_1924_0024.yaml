tldr: The authors studied the electric response of reflex contractions in spinal and
  decerebrate preparations. They found that the electric response in spinal preparations
  mainly consists of regular action currents, while in decerebrate preparations, secondary
  waves are more prominent. The results provide insights into the functioning of the
  reflex arc and the central nervous system's role in controlling muscle contractions.
