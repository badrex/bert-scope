tldr: The authors study the fine structure of elastoidin, a protein found in fish
  fins, and compare it to rat tail tendon collagen using electron microscopy and X-ray
  diffraction. They find that while the longitudinal structure is similar, the transverse
  structure is different. This research provides insights into the molecular arrangement
  and fibrillogenesis of elastoidin and collagen.
