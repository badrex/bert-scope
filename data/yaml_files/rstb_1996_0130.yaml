tldr: The article discusses the specialized systems within the primate frontal cortex
  for processing mnemonic information. It proposes a two-level hypothesis that the
  mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex is responsible for monitoring and manipulating information
  within working memory, while the mid-ventrolateral frontal cortex is involved in
  retrieving information from posterior cortical association areas. The study provides
  evidence from functional activation studies and lesion experiments in monkeys, demonstrating
  the critical role of the lateral frontal cortex in executive functions and memory
  processing.
