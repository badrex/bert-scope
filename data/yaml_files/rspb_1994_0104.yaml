tldr: The study investigates the design of the circling display given by male bluehead
  wrasses before spawning. The display includes color changes, the presence of pectoral
  fin spots, rapid fin movements, and curving of the male's body. The research aims
  to understand why this signal is designed in the particular way it is and how it
  contributes to the selection pressures of information, transmission, and sensory
  properties of the receiver.
