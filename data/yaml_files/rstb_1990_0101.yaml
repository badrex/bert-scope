tldr: The author argues that the problem with automation is not over-automation, but
  rather inadequate feedback and interaction with human operators. They propose that
  appropriate design should provide continual feedback, interact effectively with
  operators, and account for worst-case scenarios. The author suggests that automation
  systems should either be made less intelligent or more so, but the current level
  is insufficient, leading to difficulties in handling abnormalities and providing
  necessary information to the crew.
