tldr: The authors analyze the stability of spiral flow between rotating cylinders,
  considering the effect of an axial pressure gradient. They use the narrow gap approximation,
  axisymmetric disturbances assumption, and the assumption of same-direction rotation
  to study the problem. The onset of instability depends on the Taylor number and
  axial Reynolds number. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the stability
  boundary in the Taylor number plane and discusses the limitations of existing experimental
  data.
