tldr: This paper discusses the completion of a magnetic survey of the British Islands,
  conducted between 1842 and 1845. The survey was carried out under the supervision
  of Captain Frederick John Evans and involved observations of the Earth's magnetic
  field. The results are presented in maps and tables, accounting for the secular
  change in the magnetic field between the observation dates and the epoch of 1842-5.
