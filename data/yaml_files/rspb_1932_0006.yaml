tldr: The authors conducted experiments on parasitic hymenoptera larvae to study their
  respiration mechanisms. They discovered that the general body surface of these larvae
  acts as a respiratory surface, and the problem of respiration in apneustic aquatic
  and parasitic larvae is essentially the same. The study used chemical and biological
  indicators to determine the relative rates of gaseous exchange in different parts
  of the body surface, providing insights into the respiration mechanisms of these
  parasites.
