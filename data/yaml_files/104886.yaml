tldr: Gowin Knight conducted a series of experiments to study magnetism and its effects
  on various materials. He demonstrated how magnets can attract and repel each other,
  and how their poles can be changed by touching other magnets. Knight also showed
  how magnets can be used to lift weights, and tested the strength of different magnets,
  including an artificial magnet that could lift 31 pounds and 3/4.
