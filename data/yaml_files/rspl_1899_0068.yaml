tldr: The author examines the correlation between lunar phases and birth rates, analyzing
  data from maternity records at Guy's Hospital. They find little to no correlation
  between lunar phases and birth frequency, suggesting that any lunar or tidal influence
  on the menstrual cycle has likely diminished over time.
