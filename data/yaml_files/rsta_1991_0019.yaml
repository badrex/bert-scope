tldr: This article discusses the importance of considering dynamic loading and environmental
  factors when selecting materials for ship structures. It highlights the need to
  incorporate factors such as fatigue, corrosion, and fracture mechanics into the
  design process to ensure the durability and safety of ships. The article also reviews
  methods to analyze failed ships and experiments to simulate the environment in which
  ships operate, providing insights into improving materials selection procedures.
