tldr: Chadwick, Blackett, and Occhialini conducted experiments using a cloud chamber
  to study the production of positive electrons. They discovered that cosmic rays
  were responsible for the creation of these particles, which they called "mesotrons."
  This research contributed to the understanding of nuclear physics and the development
  of particle accelerators.
