tldr: This study investigates the action of various plant parts, such as leaves, seeds,
  roots, and bulbs, on photographic plates in the dark. The author finds that most
  plant substances have the ability to act on photographic plates, with the activity
  increasing as the plant grows. The author suggests that the active substance may
  be hydrogen peroxide, which is comparable to the activity of a plant. The study
  also examines the activity of different parts of seeds, fruits, bulbs, and nuts,
  and how they affect photographic plates.
