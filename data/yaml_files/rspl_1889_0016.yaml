tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how green plants assimilate carbon
  from various organic compounds. They discovered that plants can only assimilate
  carbon from carbohydrates or closely related bodies, and not from aldehydes or their
  derivatives. The study also found that plants have lost the ability to use organic
  compounds as a carbon source due to their normal process of obtaining carbon from
  CO2.
