tldr: The author, Jo. Battista Donius, discusses the unhealthiness of the Roman countryside
  and proposes solutions to restore its salubrity. He attributes the unhealthy conditions
  to southern winds, standing waters, low shores, inconsistent weather, and excessive
  heat. Donius suggests draining stagnant waters, draining the Pontine Lakes, planting
  pine trees, building houses on raised ground, and providing access to clean water
  to improve the health of the area.
