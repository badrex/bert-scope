tldr: This article investigates the generation of aerodynamic surface sound from a
  turbulent boundary layer. The author derives an integral theorem that relates the
  motion of a fluid around a rigid body to the stress distribution on the surface.
  The study focuses on an infinite flat plate in a uniform stream, showing that a
  finite dipole radiation per unit area is produced, which decreases with distance
  down the plate.
