tldr: Dr. Richardson reports on the discovery of subterranean trees in Yorkshire,
  describing their characteristics, uses, and possible origins. These trees, found
  buried several feet below the ground, are used for timber, lathes, and lighting
  tobacco. They are similar in texture and appearance to fir or pine trees and are
  believed to be native to the area, despite the absence of such trees in the region
  today.
