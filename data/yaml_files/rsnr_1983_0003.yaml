tldr: This article discusses the development of the energy conservation principle
  and its application to optical phenomena, particularly the absorption of light.
  It highlights the work of George Gabriel Stokes, Anders Jonas Ångström, and other
  scientists in understanding the interaction of light with matter and the limitations
  of the undulatory theory. The article also introduces the phenomenon of fluorescence
  and its relation to energy conservation.
