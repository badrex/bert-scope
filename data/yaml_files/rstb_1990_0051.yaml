tldr: The article discusses platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF), its structure,
  and its role in various biological processes, including cell differentiation, development,
  wound healing, and disease. PDGF is a potent molecule that induces multiple responses
  in cells, such as cell replication, chemotaxis, and modulation of extracellular
  matrix turnover. The article highlights the importance of understanding PDGF's role
  in health and disease, as it is involved in various biological events like embryogenesis,
  growth, development, and neoplasia.
