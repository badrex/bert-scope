tldr: The study investigates the development of action potentials in slow muscle fibers
  after complete or partial denervation in frogs. It shows that after denervation,
  sodium channels are built into discrete areas of the slow fiber membrane, and the
  process depends on the amount of denervation in individual fibers. The results suggest
  that action potential mechanisms develop in spots or patches, leading to areas of
  the slow fiber membrane transforming at various rates.
