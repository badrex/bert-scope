tldr: The article discusses the cryo-protection of protein crystals against radiation
  damage in electron and X-ray diffraction. By cooling protein crystals to liquid
  nitrogen temperatures, their stability and resistance to radiation damage can be
  significantly improved. This allows for longer and more accurate diffraction pattern
  analysis, which is essential for understanding the structure and function of proteins.
  The findings suggest that using small crystals, rapid freezing, and improving synchrotron
  X-ray source intensities can lead to more productive research in this field.
