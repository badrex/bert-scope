tldr: The authors improved the oil-drop method for determining the electronic charge
  by using a horizontal electric field and a photographic method to measure the velocity
  of the drop. This allowed them to detect and correct for errors in timing, Brownian
  motion, and Stokes's law. Their method resulted in a more accurate determination
  of the electronic charge, reducing the uncertainty in previous measurements.
