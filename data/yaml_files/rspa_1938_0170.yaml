tldr: This study investigates the rates of transformation of ammonium and ethylammonium
  cyanates to their corresponding ureas in ethyl alcohol. The authors found that the
  reaction follows a bimolecular mechanism and that the rates of transformation are
  influenced by neutral salts. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanism
  and the factors affecting the reaction rates.
