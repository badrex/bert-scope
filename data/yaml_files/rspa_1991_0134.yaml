tldr: This paper investigates singularities in water waves and the Rayleigh-Taylor
  instability, focusing on their formation and location. The author presents results
  describing the precise form, number, and location of singularities in the unphysical
  domain as the wave height increases. These findings can be used to calculate water
  waves numerically in an efficient manner. The study of singularities in these flows
  helps to understand their ill-posedness and the potential effects of regularization
  on their time evolution.
