tldr: The authors synthesized new supramolecular architectures using hydrogen bonding
  to study the strength and specificity of multiply hydrogen bonded complexes. They
  found that the arrangement of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups is a good
  predictor of binding strength, and that these recognition units can serve as the
  basis for constructing new synthetic hosts or self-assembling systems. The study
  also investigated the factors that control the stability of these complexes, such
  as geometry, acidity, and basicity of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups.
