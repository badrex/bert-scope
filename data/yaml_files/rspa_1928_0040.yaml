tldr: This article investigates the alkaline earth halide spectra and their origin,
  focusing on the absorption spectra of halogen salts of alkaline earth elements.
  The authors discovered that the bands originate from subhalide molecules, rather
  than normal halide molecules, and provide a detailed account of their experimental
  methods and findings.
