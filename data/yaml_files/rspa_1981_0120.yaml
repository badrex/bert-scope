tldr: The authors studied the behavior of helium bubbles in b.c.c. metals, focusing
  on the rate-controlling mechanisms for gas bubble migration. They found that helium
  bubble growth is consistent with surface diffusion for small bubbles and ledge nucleation
  for larger bubbles. The bubble growth rate, and consequently the swelling and embrittlement
  behavior of the material, is sensitive to material purity and segregation effects.
  The research provides insights into the mechanical behavior of containment materials
  in nuclear reactors.
