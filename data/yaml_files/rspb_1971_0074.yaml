tldr: 'This study investigates the effects of drug inhibition on memory formation
  in chickens, specifically focusing on long-term memory. Researchers found that inhibitors
  of the sodium pump can block memory formation only if present during the learning
  process, while inhibitors of protein synthesis can prevent long-term memory formation
  even when administered after learning. These findings suggest that there are at
  least two stages in memory formation: a short-term phase dependent on membrane mechanisms
  and a permanent storage phase dependent on protein synthesis.'
