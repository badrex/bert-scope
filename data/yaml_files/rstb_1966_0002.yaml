tldr: The authors study the fine structure of the centriolar apparatus and associated
  structures in the complex flagellates Trichonympha and Pseudotrichonympha using
  electron microscopy. They describe the intricate organization of the rostral tube,
  inner and outer caps, and rostral flagella in Trichonympha, while in Pseudotrichonympha,
  they find a more complex structure with distinct inner and outer walls and elaborate
  systems of fibers. The findings provide insights into the structure and function
  of centriolar structures in these flagellates and contribute to the understanding
  of cell organization and evolution.
