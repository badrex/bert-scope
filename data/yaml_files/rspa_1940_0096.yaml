tldr: This study investigates the X-ray structure and elastic strains in copper while
  the metal is under tensile stress. The research shows that the permanent strain
  is associated with the breakdown of grains into crystallite formations, which is
  an irreversible process. The elastic strain of the metal is accompanied by reversible
  changes in the atomic lattice without any permanent distortion. The study also reveals
  the differences in the rate of strain in neighboring grains subjected to the same
  external stress, which explains the extensive breakdown of grains into components
  of varying orientations in polycrystalline metals after deformation beyond the yield
  point.
