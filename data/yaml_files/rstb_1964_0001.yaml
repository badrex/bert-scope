tldr: This article examines the mandibular mechanisms and evolution of arthropods,
  covering the endoskeletal systems of their heads, mouthparts, and other structures.
  It explores the development of mandibles in different arthropod classes, their movements,
  and the adaptations that have occurred for feeding on various types of food. The
  study also discusses the differences between mandibles in hexapods and crustaceans
  and how they have evolved independently.
