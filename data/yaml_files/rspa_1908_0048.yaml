tldr: The author, C. T. R. Wilson, describes a method to measure the atmospheric electric
  potential gradient and the earth-air current. They conducted experiments using a
  gold leaf electrometer and found that the ratio of the current to the charge remained
  consistent when the test-plate was covered with turf. This research aimed to determine
  the charge per square centimeter of the ground and the current entering each square
  centimeter of the ground.
