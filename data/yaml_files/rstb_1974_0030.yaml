tldr: This study investigates the occurrence of haemoglobin-J (Tongariki) and thalassaemia
  in two New Guinea communities. The researchers found a high frequency of haemoglobin-J
  (Tongariki) in several villages on Karkar Island and the adjacent mainland. This
  variant may serve as a useful genetic marker for studying Melanesian populations.
  The study also provides evidence for the possible existence of thalassaemia in the
  communities.
