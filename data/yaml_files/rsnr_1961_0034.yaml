tldr: The authors analyze the age of election to the Royal Society and find that the
  median age at election has remained consistent over the years. They suggest that
  75% of elections should be made by 50 years old to better recognize high scientific
  merit. The authors also note a backlog of strong candidates who were elected at
  ages between 65 and 75.
