tldr: The author presents a method for solving problems involving diffraction and
  refraction of plane pulses in isotropic non-dissipative media. The study covers
  both acoustic and electromagnetic theories, with applications in wave propagation,
  diffraction, and refraction. The research focuses on pulse diffraction within a
  homogeneous prism and extends the method to find a solution in the case of a half-plane
  with its edge on the surface separating two distinct isotropic media.
