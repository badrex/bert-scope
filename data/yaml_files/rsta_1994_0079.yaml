tldr: The article discusses the organization and formation of lamellae in melt-crystallized
  polymers, focusing on their role in creating spherulites and the impact on the properties
  of the material. The authors explain how lamellae are not all equivalent and that
  their mutual disposition is crucial for the overall structure. They also describe
  the distortion of lamellae during growth and the influence of factors such as temperature
  and time on the resulting texture.
