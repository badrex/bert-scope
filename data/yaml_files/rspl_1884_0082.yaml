tldr: The author examines the phenomenon of crystalline reflection in chlorate of
  potash crystals and discovers a unique spectrum of colors produced by the interaction
  of light with the crystals. The colors are not due to absorption and are seen in
  both polarized and unpolarized light. The study provides insights into the optical
  properties of crystals and the behavior of light during reflection.
