tldr: This study investigates the development of the head and pharynx in urodele larvae,
  specifically Hynobius nebulosus and H. retardatus. The research focuses on the chondrocranium,
  jaws, hyobranchial skeleton, ossifications, cranial and anterior spinal nerves,
  musculature, blood system, and other anatomical features. The findings support the
  concept of segmental organization in the vertebrate head and provide insights into
  the evolution of air-breathing tetrapods from aquatic ancestors.
