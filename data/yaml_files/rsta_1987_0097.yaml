tldr: This article discusses the vast scientific campaign associated with the 1986
  return of Halley's Comet, which greatly improved and expanded our knowledge of comets.
  It covers the large-scale structure, chemistry, and nucleus of the comet, confirming
  Biermann and Alfven's basic picture involving the interaction with the solar wind.
  The cometary environment is a rich plasma physics laboratory and the site of spectacular
  disconnection events. The chemical composition of the nucleus is largely water,
  and the breakup of the water molecule produces the large hydrogen cloud surrounding
  the comet. The composition of the dust generally resembles carbonaceous chondrites
  enriched in elements and O. The interest in cometary chemistry stems from the belief
  that cometary material is probably the best remnant of the solar nebula's original
  composition. The nucleus is monolithic, irregular, and peanut- or potato-shaped,
  with a very dark surface where gas and dust emission occurs in jets on the sunward
  side.
