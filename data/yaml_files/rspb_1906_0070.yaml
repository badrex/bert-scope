tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fermentation of glucose by yeast
  juice and discovered the presence of a dialysable coferment substance. This coferment
  is essential for the fermentation process and can be activated by adding boiled
  yeast juice. The authors also found that the coferment disappears from yeast juice
  less rapidly in the presence of glucose than in its absence.
