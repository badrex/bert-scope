tldr: The authors analyze the energy relations in radioactive disintegration, focusing
  on the upper limit of beta-ray spectra. They propose hypotheses about the energy
  differences between nuclei and the maximum energy of ejected particles in beta decay.
  The study provides evidence for the significance of the upper limit of beta-ray
  spectra and its relation to energy conservation in nuclear transitions.
