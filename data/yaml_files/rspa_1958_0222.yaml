tldr: The article discusses the methods used to analyze data from Russian artificial
  earth satellites, specifically using interferometer and Doppler measurements. The
  authors describe the process of calculating orbit parameters and the challenges
  involved in obtaining accurate results. They also mention the potential for further
  analysis using digital computers and kinetheodolite observations to study the effects
  of the Earth's oblateness and atmosphere on the satellites' orbits.
