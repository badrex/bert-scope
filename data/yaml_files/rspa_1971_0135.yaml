tldr: The authors explore the use of electric fields to disperse solid and liquid
  fuels and control the trajectories of charged particles and droplets. They establish
  the feasibility of the method using powdered solids and distilled water, then apply
  it to paraffin as fuel. The study covers dispersion, droplet charging, movement
  in fields, and combustion control, leading to the development of burners operated
  entirely by fields that draw in and accelerate air from the surroundings using corona
  discharges in multi-stage ion lamps.
