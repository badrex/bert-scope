tldr: The author analyzed barometer observations at the Magnetic Observatory in St.
  Helena to study the influence of the Moon on atmospheric pressure. They found that
  the Moon's passage over both the inferior and superior meridian causes a slight
  increase in pressure, with a maximum curve occurring at both. The study also showed
  that the rise of tides does not account for the entire increase in pressure, and
  the pressure is greater around new moon than full moon.
