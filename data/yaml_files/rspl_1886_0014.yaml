tldr: The author investigates local magnetic disturbances in islands far from a continent,
  focusing on the effects of blue and red magnetism. They use observations made on
  land and at sea to determine normal values and the extent of disturbances in various
  islands. The study highlights the importance of adopting uniform observing standards
  and the need for more extensive observations in some areas.
