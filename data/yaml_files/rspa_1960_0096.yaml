tldr: The article explores the structure of a non-relativistic S-matrix in particle
  scattering. It discusses the analytical properties of the matrix, the extension
  of unitarity conditions to complex energy spaces, and the concept of resonance states.
  The author establishes conditions on the matrix elements and shows how they can
  be generated from a single function, given the positions of its poles in the complex
  plane.
