tldr: The authors numerically derive steady solutions of the induction equation for
  a specific class of three-dimensional flows in a conducting fluid sphere surrounded
  by an insulator. They examine the effects of varying the spatial scale and degree
  of asymmetry of the motions, and discuss the implications of their findings for
  the production of the Earth's magnetic field and the core's heat dissipation.
