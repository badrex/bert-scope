tldr: The study investigates the effects of hypophysectomy on the reproductive organs
  of male and female ferrets during anoestrus. The results show that hypophysectomy
  inhibits the onset of breeding season changes and only slightly accentuates the
  atrophic condition of the reproductive organs. This suggests that the pituitary
  body of the ferret is practically inactive during the extreme of anoestrus.
