tldr: The authors construct angular momentum coherent states by combining the work
  of Carruthers and Nieto on harmonic oscillator coherent states with Schwinger's
  formulation of angular momentum. These states are particularly useful for discussing
  the transition from quantum to classical angular momentum and have implications
  for the density matrix formulation of problems involving angular momenta.
