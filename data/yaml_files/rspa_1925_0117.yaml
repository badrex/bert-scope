tldr: This article discusses the absorption spectra of mixed metallic vapours, specifically
  volatile compounds of magnesium and alkali metals. The author describes the process
  of creating these compounds and their spectra, and suggests that these observations
  are the first direct evidence for the existence of volatile inter-metallic compounds.
  The study also investigates the possibility of chemical combination between magnesium
  and alkali metals.
