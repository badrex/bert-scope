tldr: The author presents a new method of driving off poisonous gases using oscillating
  fans. The fan creates air currents that push the gas away from the area, providing
  fresh air for soldiers in trenches. The author demonstrates the effectiveness of
  the fan in clearing trenches, dug-outs, and other areas of accumulated gas, improving
  living conditions for soldiers during wartime.
