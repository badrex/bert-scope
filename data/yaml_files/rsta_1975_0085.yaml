tldr: This article establishes the existence of symplectic structure in degenerate
  variational problems, proving that Poincare's conserved antisymmetric derived bilinear
  differential form in the orbit manifold of any regular degenerate problem admits
  no null vectors other than those representing infinitesimal deviations due to indeterminacy
  in the evolution of the orbit. The author also shows how to construct a regular
  variational principle reproducing all given orbits and the associated bilinear form.
