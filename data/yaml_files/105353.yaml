tldr: The author, Josiah Colebrooke, conducted a series of experiments to revive the
  ancient encaustic painting technique, which uses wax as a binder for pigments. He
  tested various methods and materials, but found that the technique was challenging
  to master and did not produce satisfactory results. The author concluded that the
  wax was primarily used as a varnish to preserve the colors from fading, and suggested
  alternative methods for art preservation and restoration.
