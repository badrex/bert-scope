tldr: The author conducted a study on the early development of Lepidosteus osseus,
  a type of fish, during the first three weeks of its life. They collected material
  from Black Lake, New York, and observed the development process, including the formation
  of the egg, segmentation, and the development of the nervous system. The study provides
  insights into the early stages of fish development and the unique characteristics
  of the Lepidosteus osseus.
