tldr: This article discusses the growth and form of modular organisms, which grow
  by the repeated iteration of multicellular parts called modules. It explores the
  differences between modular and unitary organisms, the various forms and structures
  of modular organisms, and how their growth patterns affect their interactions with
  their environment and other organisms. The article also touches upon the potential
  for somatic mutation in modular organisms and the implications for evolutionary
  processes.
