tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the Earth's shape and the methods
  to determine the figure of the Earth. He examines the two main opinions of the time,
  one by Cassini and the other by Newton, and demonstrates how to calculate the distance
  from the pole to the zenith using an ellipse. The author also discusses the impact
  of the Earth's rotation on the plumb line and the importance of accurate measurements
  for understanding the Earth's figure.
