tldr: This article discusses nuclear acoustic resonance in europium vanadate, a crystal
  with the zircon structure. The author explains the theory behind the absorption
  of acoustic waves and how they interact with the nuclear spins in the crystal. The
  study focuses on the ground state of the europium ion and the two stable isotopes
  of mass 151 and 153, which have nuclear spin 5/2. The author deduces the formulae
  for nuclear acoustic resonance and discusses the potential applications of this
  method in studying europium vanadate and other similar crystals.
