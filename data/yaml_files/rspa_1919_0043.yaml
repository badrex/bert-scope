tldr: This article investigates the solvent action of pyridine on coal substances
  and the factors affecting the extraction process. The authors found that oxygen
  and water in the pyridine solution can hinder the extraction process, and they provide
  methods to purify and dehydrate the pyridine for better results. They also discuss
  the importance of coal's fineness and temperature control during the extraction
  process.
