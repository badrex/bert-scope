tldr: This article explores various methods for solving the inverse scattering problem,
  which involves determining the shape and constitution of a scattering body based
  on the incident field and scattered far field. The authors develop a computationally
  orientated approach using the optical extinction theorem and discuss direct and
  inverse scattering methods. They also introduce a new method for reconstructing
  the shapes of certain bodies of revolution and cylindrical bodies from scattered
  fields observed at two closely spaced frequencies.
