tldr: This study presents a model for analyzing the effects of atmospheric oblateness
  and diurnal density variation on satellite orbits. The model combines these effects
  in a single framework and provides a method for calculating drag perturbations when
  the density scale-height varies with altitude. The research focuses on the contraction
  of satellite orbits and the perturbations in the elements describing the contraction,
  which can be used to study the behavior of satellites and the properties of the
  upper atmosphere.
