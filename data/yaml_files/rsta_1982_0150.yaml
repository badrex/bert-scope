tldr: The article discusses the synthesis of heteronuclear metal clusters containing
  rhodium using novel routes based on isolobal relationships between metal ligand
  fragments and organic species. The authors demonstrate the preparation of various
  compounds with metal-metal bonds, highlighting the potential of this approach in
  the synthesis of new metal clusters and the importance of understanding isolobal
  concepts in inorganic and organic chemistry.
