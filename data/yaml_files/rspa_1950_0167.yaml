tldr: The authors describe various methods of interference microscopy and propose
  a new type of interferometer microscope that overcomes some of the limitations of
  existing techniques. This new design allows for a larger illuminating aperture and
  the use of white light, while still providing accurate representations of optical
  thickness. The authors also discuss the potential for further improvements in microscope
  design and the accurate measurement of optical thickness.
