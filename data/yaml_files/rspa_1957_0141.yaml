tldr: The authors present a mathematical analysis of network formation in irradiated
  polyesters, focusing on gel formation and solubility. They develop a model that
  considers a combination of polymerization reactions and the linking of polyester
  molecules, taking into account factors such as cross-linking index, molecular weight,
  and molecular weight distribution. This analysis extends previous work on radiation-induced
  cross-linking and degradation of long-chain polymers to the case of chain reactions
  in shorter molecules.
