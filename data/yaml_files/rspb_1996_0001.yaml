tldr: The article explores the diffusion-regulated control of cellular dendritic morphogenesis,
  focusing on the role of diffusible growth-regulating factors (morphogens) like calcium
  ions. The authors model the growth of cells under the influence of these morphogens
  and demonstrate how unstable growth, influenced by membrane conductance, galvanotropism,
  and chemotropism, leads to complex branching patterns. This self-organizing pattern
  formation aligns with the development of real neurons under similar conditions.
