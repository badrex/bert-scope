tldr: This article investigates the third positive carbon bands and associated bands,
  focusing on their structure and origin. The author examines the band spectra of
  carbon and the CO molecule, providing a detailed analysis of the quantum interpretation
  and electronic levels involved. The study contributes to the understanding of molecular
  spectra and the role of the quantum theory in their interpretation.
