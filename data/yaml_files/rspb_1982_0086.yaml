tldr: The study investigates the effects of ovarian steroids, such as estrogen and
  progesterone, on the electrical activity of hypothalamic neurons and luteinizing
  hormone (LH) secretion in ovariectomized rats with diencephalic islands. The results
  show that the steroid-stimulated LH surge is significantly correlated with the increase
  in the electrical activity of preoptic and anterior hypothalamic neurons. This research
  provides insights into the mechanism of ovarian steroid action on the neuroendocrine
  control of LH secretion.
