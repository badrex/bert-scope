tldr: This study measures the surface area of the gill lamellae in the coelacanth,
  Latimeria chalumnae, and compares it to other fish species. The results show a low
  surface area in the coelacanth, indicating a relatively inactive lifestyle with
  a low consumption rate and food requirement. The study also examines the gill morphology
  and provides insights into the adaptation of the coelacanth to its environment.
