tldr: The authors study the response of an oscillatory system to excitation by a transient
  displacement. They show that the response is the same as that due to excitation
  by a transient force, simplifying the solution of vibration problems involving time-dependent
  boundary conditions. The concepts of effective modal stiffness and effective modal
  mass are also elucidated.
