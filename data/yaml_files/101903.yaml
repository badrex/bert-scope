tldr: This article discusses observations made at Nurenburg by P. Wurtzelbaur and
  Bernard Walther comparing the latitude and obliquity of the ecliptic over 200 years.
  The findings show that the latitude of Nurenburg and the obliquity of the ecliptic
  have remained unchanged, which challenges the hypothesis of a translation of the
  Earth's poles. The author also mentions the importance of the latitude of Alexandria
  and the possibility of a sudden change in the Earth's axis.
