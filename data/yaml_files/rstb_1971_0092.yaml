tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between acid secretion and oxidative
  metabolism in gastric mucosa using non-destructive optical techniques. They found
  that high rates of acid secretion are associated with cytochrome reduction, and
  that changes in chloride secretion result in opposite cytochrome redox changes.
  The results suggest a close coupling between the respiratory chain components and
  hydrogen ion secretion, which may involve changes in intracellular pH rather than
  changes in high energy phosphate compounds.
