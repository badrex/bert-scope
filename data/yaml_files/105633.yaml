tldr: The author describes a rare starfish with a jointed stem found on the coast
  of Barbados. The starfish's unique structure and resemblance to fossils called starstones,
  asteriae, and astropodia are discussed. The author also examines the internal anatomy
  and the way the starfish moves, suggesting that it may be similar to corals, sponges,
  and other marine creatures that attach to rocks and shells.
