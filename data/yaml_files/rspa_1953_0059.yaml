tldr: The authors present a detailed study of eight variational poly-detor wave functions
  for boron and carbon, resulting in more accurate calculations than previously available.
  They discuss the process of projective reduction, organization of numerical calculations,
  and the choice of initial functions. The study also introduces new checking procedures
  and classification methods to improve accuracy and efficiency in wave function calculations.
