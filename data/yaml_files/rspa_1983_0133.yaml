tldr: The authors present a complete and explicit example of a subcritical Hopf bifurcation
  in the rotating Benard problem, demonstrating the loss of stability of the steady
  conducting state. They show that the bifurcation is subcritical, meaning that the
  periodic solution is unstable, and the steady solution loses stability to a solution
  that is not a Hopf periodic solution.
