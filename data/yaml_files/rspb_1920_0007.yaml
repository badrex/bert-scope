tldr: The author conducted further research on chromosome dimensions and found that
  previous generalizations about chromosome diameter and somatic complexity were not
  accurate. They discovered that chromosome diameters can vary within a complex and
  that the total volume of chromatin on the spindle is not consistent across different
  animal species. This evidence challenges previous theories about chromosome development
  and evolution.
