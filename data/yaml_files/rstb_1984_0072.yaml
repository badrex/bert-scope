tldr: This article examines the ecological effects of deposited sulphur and nitrogen
  compounds in Sphagnum-dominated peat bogs, which are naturally acid ecosystems.
  The study focuses on a peat bog in the northern Pennines and explores the importance
  of different sources of acidity. The research also investigates the interconversion
  of sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds and their impact on acidity levels.
