tldr: This article discusses the chemistry of corrinoids, focusing on the physical
  and chemical properties of corphyrins. The authors investigate the interaction between
  the conjugated ring, cobalt ion, and axial ligands using various techniques, including
  absorption and reflection spectroscopy, circular dichroism, proton magnetic resonance,
  electron spin resonance, and controlled potential reduction. The study provides
  insights into the valency, structure, and equilibria of cobalamins and cobinamides,
  contributing to a better understanding of their properties and potential applications.
