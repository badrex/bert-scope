tldr: The authors apply the theory of probabilities to study the spread of infectious
  diseases, focusing on the factors that influence infectivity and transmission. They
  develop mathematical models to analyze the impact of changes in infectivity and
  environment on disease outbreaks, providing insights into the behavior of epidemics
  and the potential for controlling their spread.
