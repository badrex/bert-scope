tldr: This article discusses the author's observations of alternating diurnal currents
  of electricity at the terrestrial surface and their connection with the diurnal
  variation of the horizontal magnetic needle. The author conducted experiments on
  the Midland Railway's electric telegraph and found that the electric current was
  subject to a regular diurnal alternation, with the times of zero agreeing with the
  known times of the magnetic needle's variation. The deflection to the left corresponded
  with easterly variation, and the deflection to the right with westerly variation.
