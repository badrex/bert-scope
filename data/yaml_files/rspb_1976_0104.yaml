tldr: This article discusses the physiological mechanisms controlling the menstrual
  and ovarian cycles and how current contraceptives interfere with these processes.
  The author explores the possibility of producing amenorrhea by altering hypothalamic
  activity to mimic prepubertal and lactational states, aiming to develop more effective
  contraceptives with fewer side effects on menstruation.
