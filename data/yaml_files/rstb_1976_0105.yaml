tldr: This article discusses the differences in assembly and genome packaging mechanisms
  between single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) bacteriophages.
  It highlights that ssRNA bacteriophages use RNA as a core and initiator for capsid
  formation, while dsDNA bacteriophages rely on preformed capsids. The article also
  explores the role of RNA's compact structure and flexibility in its packaging process,
  which is different from the more rigid and volume-occupying nature of dsDNA.
