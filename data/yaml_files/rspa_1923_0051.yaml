tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the line spectrum of chlorine in the
  ultra-violet region. They used various techniques to eliminate impurities and measured
  over 200 lines between wavelengths 3354 and 2070 A. The study provides a better
  understanding of chlorine's spectrum and its interactions with other elements.
