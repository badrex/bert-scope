tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the behavior of molecules in the vicinity
  of electrodes during electrolysis. They found that the molecules near the positive
  and negative poles have different polarization levels, and the electric influence
  spreads out in the electrolyte, similar to the magnetic field. This research helps
  to understand the physical processes involved in electrolysis and unites different
  types of electricity.
