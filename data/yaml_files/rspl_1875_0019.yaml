tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of light on the electrical
  conductivity of tellurium and selenium. They found that both materials showed a
  decrease in resistance when exposed to light, with tellurium being more sensitive
  to light than selenium. The change in resistance was found to be inversely proportional
  to the distance from the light source and directly proportional to the square root
  of the illuminating power.
