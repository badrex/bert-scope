tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the viscosity and molecular dimensions
  of gaseous cyanogen. They found that the mean collision area of a cyanogen molecule
  is greater than that of a nitrogen molecule. The results provide insights into the
  shape and size of molecules and their behavior in collisions.
