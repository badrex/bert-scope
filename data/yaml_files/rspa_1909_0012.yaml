tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the velocity and penetrating power
  of cathode rays ejected by substances exposed to y-rays of radium. They used different
  methods, such as measuring the scattering of cathode particles and ionization in
  chambers, to analyze the properties of the secondary radiation. The results showed
  that the radiation was heterogeneous, with some rays being more easily absorbed
  than others. The author also investigated the effect of different materials on the
  radiation and found that the radiation from a sheet of paper and a sheet of aluminum
  foil produced similar amounts of secondary radiation.
