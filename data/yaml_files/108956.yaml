tldr: The author examines the anatomy and physiology of Nematoids, focusing on their
  zoological position and affinities to Echinoderms. They discover the organization
  of the nervous and circulatory systems in these animals, which helps clarify their
  place in the animal kingdom. The study also highlights the remarkable tenacity of
  life and powers of repair in some Nematoids, making them objects of interest to
  biologists.
