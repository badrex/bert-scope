tldr: The author investigates calcium's ability to absorb various gases for the production
  of high vacuums and spectroscopic research. They find that calcium, when heated
  to high temperatures, can effectively absorb all gases except the argon group, making
  it a valuable tool for creating high vacuums and detecting trace gases. This research
  improves upon previous methods that relied on multiple reagents and provided less
  efficient results.
