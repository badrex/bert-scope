tldr: The authors discovered that voltage-gated K+ channels from different subfamilies,
  Shaker (Kv1) and Shaw (Kv3), can form heteromultimeric assemblies when mixed in
  Xenopus oocytes. These heteromultimeric channels exhibit microheterogeneity, displaying
  a mosaic of characteristics inherited from both parental channels. This finding
  expands our understanding of the diverse functions and properties of K+ channels
  in neurons and other cell types.
