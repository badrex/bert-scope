tldr: The authors studied the structure and properties of the Cu2MnIn alloy, a type
  of Heusler alloy with a body-centered cubic structure. They found that the superlattice
  in this alloy is more stable than in other Heusler alloys. The alloy exhibits ferromagnetism
  and has a higher magnetization when quenched. The research suggests that manganese
  behaves as a univalent element in this alloy, which is important for understanding
  its magnetic properties.
