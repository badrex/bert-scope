tldr: The authors explore the magnetic cooling method, which relies on the orientation
  of spins in a magnetic field to achieve low temperatures. They discuss the time
  required for spins to orientate in the field and the limitations of the method due
  to the interaction between spins and lattice vibrations. The study focuses on paramagnetic
  salts and their potential for achieving lower temperatures.
