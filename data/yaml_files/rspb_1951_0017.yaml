revised_title: 'The Role of Alkali-Metal Ions in the Metabolism of Bacteria: Uptake
  of Radioactive Potassium, Rubidium, and Phosphorus'
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology
semantic_tags:
- Metabolism

- Alkali-metal ions
- Radioactive tracers
- Nutrient uptake
tldr: The authors conducted experiments using radioactive tracers to study the uptake
  of alkali-metal ions, such as potassium and rubidium, in the bacteria Bact. lactis
  aerogenes. They found that alkali-metal ions are necessary for the oxidation of
  substrates and growth of cells, and that the uptake of these ions is influenced
  by the pH of the environment. The authors also discovered that rubidium can replace
  potassium in the metabolism of certain substrates, such as glucose, glycerol, pyruvic
  acid, and succinic acid.
