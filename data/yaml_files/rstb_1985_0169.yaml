tldr: The article discusses carbon tetrachloride toxicity as a model for studying
  free-radical mediated liver injury. It explains how carbon tetrachloride is metabolically
  activated in the liver endoplasmic reticulum, producing reactive intermediates,
  including the trichloromethyl free radical. The article also highlights the importance
  of lipid peroxidation in the liver damage caused by carbon tetrachloride and its
  relevance to tissue injury.
