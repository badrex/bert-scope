tldr: This article reviews the dynamics of planetary rings and their associated satellites
  based on data from space missions to the outer planets. It highlights the diverse
  and complex ring systems of Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune, and discusses
  the role of small satellites in determining ring structure. The article also emphasizes
  the importance of the forthcoming Cassini mission for understanding ring dynamics
  and presents a summary of critical ring observations that can only be made by a
  spacecraft orbiting Saturn for an extended period.
