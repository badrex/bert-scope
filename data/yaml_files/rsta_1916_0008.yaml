tldr: This article presents a new investigation into the combining volumes of hydrogen
  and oxygen. The authors used physical methods to purify the gases and measured their
  densities at 0Â°C and 760 mm pressure. They found that the combining volume of hydrogen
  and oxygen is 2.00245, with a high level of accuracy. This research contributes
  to the understanding of the fundamental constant and the process of gas purification.
