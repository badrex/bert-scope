tldr: The author, Captain J. Waterhouse, discovered that by using a blue-stained dry
  collodion plate, reversed photographs of the solar spectrum beyond red could be
  obtained. This new technique has potential applications in spectroscopic photography,
  particularly for mapping parts of the spectrum that are difficult to observe with
  the naked eye. The author also discusses the effect of different dyes on the sensitivity
  of the plates and the reversal of blue and violet rays.
