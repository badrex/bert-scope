tldr: The authors studied the spectrum of carbon arcs at high current densities, discovering
  that the arc's spectrum mainly consists of neutral carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, and
  hydrogen. They also found new lines belonging to C I, N I, or O I. The high current
  density arc has a higher intrinsic brightness due to the intense radiation from
  the vaporized core material.
