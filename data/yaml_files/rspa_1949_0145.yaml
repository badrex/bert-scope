tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a mass spectrometer to study the pyrolysis
  of methane, ethane, and n-butane on a platinum filament. They detected free radicals
  and observed the reactions and products formed. The results showed that methane
  dissociated into methyl radicals, while ethane and n-butane underwent molecular
  dehydrogenation and selective fission, respectively. The study provided insights
  into the mechanisms of hydrocarbon pyrolysis and the role of catalysts in these
  reactions.
