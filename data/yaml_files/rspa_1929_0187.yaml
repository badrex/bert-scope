tldr: The authors describe the construction and use of a robust microbalance with
  high sensitivity, suitable for weighing sorbed films. The balance features carborundum
  crystal points for support and a magnetic control arrangement. The authors also
  discuss the challenges faced during the development and testing of the balance,
  such as zero point shifts caused by electrostatic charges.
