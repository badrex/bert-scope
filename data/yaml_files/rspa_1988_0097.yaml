tldr: The authors study conical flows of fluid with variable viscosity and discover
  that a self-swirling jet flow develops when rotational friction is absent at the
  plane. This phenomenon can serve as a simple hydrodynamic model for some astrophysical
  and geophysical phenomena, such as jets near young stars and galaxy cores, as well
  as convergent wind-driven ocean currents.
