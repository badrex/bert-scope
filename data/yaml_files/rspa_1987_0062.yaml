tldr: This study investigates the effects of compressibility and rotation on the frequencies
  of Kelvin waves in a Rankine vortex. The research focuses on adiabatic disturbances
  that depend on the axial coordinate, considering a perfect gas and using a cylindrical
  polar coordinate system. The findings show that compressibility can destabilize
  the vortex and affect the wave instability, with the axial wavenumber playing a
  significant role in suppressing or promoting instability.
