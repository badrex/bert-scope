tldr: The author examines the structure and growth of teeth in elephants and other
  graminivorous quadrupeds. They discovered that elephant teeth have a unique structure
  composed of different materials and processes, which is also found in the teeth
  of other animals that need to grind their food. The author also refutes a previous
  theory on enamel formation and provides evidence for their own findings.
