tldr: This article discusses the nature and formation of textures in polycrystalline
  materials, focusing on the deformation and recrystallization processes in metals
  and quartz. The author outlines the genesis of textures during plastic deformation
  and the influence of pre-existing texture on subsequent deformation and creep. The
  article also analyzes the textures formed by annealing after plastic deformation
  and assesses the roles of oriented nucleation and oriented growth. Lastly, the author
  explains the formation of textures in stressed polycrystalline quartz due to Dauphine
  twinning and compares the driving forces behind this phenomenon with those responsible
  for recrystallization in metals.
