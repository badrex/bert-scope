tldr: The author discusses a large, uniquely shaped flint implement found at Selsey
  Bill, which they call the "Selsey rostrate." The implement was made from a large
  nodule and has a rostrate (tapering) shape with no carina (central ridge). The author
  suggests that it was made and used by a person with larger hands and limbs than
  modern humans. The piece is significant in the study of prehistoric archaeology
  and paleolithic tools.
