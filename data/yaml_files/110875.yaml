tldr: Michael Faraday conducted experiments on the condensation of gases, focusing
  on nitrous oxide and olefiant gas. He discovered that both gases were soluble in
  strong alcohol and other similar substances. Faraday also found that the force of
  a gas's vapor increases in a geometrical ratio with an increase in temperature.
  This research contributed to the understanding of chemical laws and the properties
  of gases.
