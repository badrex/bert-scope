tldr: The authors conducted endor experiments on ytterbium ions in calcium fluoride
  to study the energy levels and hyperfine interactions in the solid state. They determined
  several small terms in the spin-Hamiltonian and confirmed the second-order calculation's
  consistency. The high precision of endor measurements allowed them to estimate the
  energy of the state of the lowest manifold and the electric quadrupole interaction
  in the free ion. However, they were unable to measure the hyperfine structure anomaly
  due to its small size and the limitations of their precision.
