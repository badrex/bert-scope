tldr: In this article, William Huggins and his wife, Mrs. Huggins, report the discovery
  of a new group of lines in the photographic spectrum of Sirius. They discuss the
  characteristics of these lines and their potential significance, noting that they
  may indicate a different condition of the nebula on either side of the star-spectra.
  The authors also mention their plans to further examine and discuss the spectrum
  of different parts of the nebula in the future.
