tldr: The authors investigate Pendellosung interference in the Bragg reflexion of
  X-rays from a crystal surface, focusing on the diamond 113 reflexion and Cu radiation.
  They cast doubt on Uragami's claim to have observed fringes in a similar experiment
  and provide an absolute determination of the atomic scattering factor of carbon
  in the diamond 113 reflexion. The study demonstrates the challenges of observing
  Pendellosung fringes in the Bragg case and highlights the importance of experimental
  technique.
