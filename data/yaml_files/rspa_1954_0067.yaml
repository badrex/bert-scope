tldr: This article explores the reflexion of sound waves of finite amplitude by a
  rigid wall in a polytropic gas. The author solves a special case where the adiabatic
  exponent is S and the initial density is proportional to the distance from the wall.
  The solution shows that a shock wave is generated at the wall, and the motion of
  the gas behind the shock is determined by the equations of characteristics.
