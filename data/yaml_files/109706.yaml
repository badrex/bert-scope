tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, investigates the parts of trees that are primarily
  impaired by age, focusing on roots, stems, and leaves. He found that the leaves
  play a crucial role in the health of trees, as they help prepare and assimilate
  sap. Defective leaves can lead to diseases and debilities in old varieties of fruit
  trees, especially in rich soils or when grafted onto vigorous stocks. The author
  suggests that a similar process might be responsible for the debilities of old age
  in animals, possibly due to lung function.
