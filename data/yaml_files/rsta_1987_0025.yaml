tldr: The authors established molecular genetics for the fungus Phanerochaete chrysosporium,
  a key organism in lignin biodegradation. They isolated clones carrying genes expressed
  specifically in the ligninolytic phase, developed a strategy for mapping these clones,
  and elucidated the mating system of the organism. The authors also discussed the
  potential for DNA transformation, site-directed mutagenesis, and strain improvement
  through genetic crosses.
