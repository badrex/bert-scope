tldr: The authors conducted a study on the effects of surgically removing the pituitary
  gland in rabbits and the potential for hormone substitution therapy. They found
  that rabbits could survive the procedure and observed changes in behavior, body
  temperature, and reproductive cycles. The study also highlighted the importance
  of protecting hypophysectomized animals from temperature changes and the need for
  proper post-operative care.
