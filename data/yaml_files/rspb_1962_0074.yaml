tldr: The article discusses protein metabolism in human protein malnutrition, focusing
  on the effects of inadequate diets on infants. It highlights the changes in body
  composition, organ and tissue function, and cellular levels in protein-depleted
  individuals. The author also examines the dynamic aspects of protein metabolism,
  including catabolism and synthesis, and the capacity for protein synthesis in malnourished
  children once proper nutrition is provided.
