tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the fusion cross-sections of deuterons
  with low energies. They used a gas target and scintillation detectors to observe
  the fast protons from the reaction. The results provide a better understanding of
  nuclear reactions and their contribution to thermonuclear reactions and astrophysics.
