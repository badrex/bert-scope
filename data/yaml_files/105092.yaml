tldr: This article describes a unique surgical procedure performed by Mr. Joseph Warner
  to remove a stone and a piece of bone from a patient's bladder. The patient had
  been suffering from the symptoms of a bladder stone for two years. Mr. Warner used
  a new method of cutting the urethra obliquely, which allowed for easier access to
  the bladder and reduced incontinence. The surgery was successful, and the patient
  was able to retain urine and recover fully.
