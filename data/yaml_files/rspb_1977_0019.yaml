tldr: The study investigates the development of the tail and excretory system in the
  cercaria of Cryptocotyle lingua, a parasitic flatworm. The tail develops within
  the redia and molluscan host, with epidermal cell bodies and striated caudal muscles
  forming the tail's structure. The excretory system includes a secondary excretory
  pore, which forms at the posterior end of the body. The tail is shed when the cercaria
  contacts its fish intermediate host, and the tail's function as an organ of propulsion
  is accomplished.
