tldr: The authors studied the effects of sodium pump inhibitors, specifically cardiac
  glycosides, on neuromuscular transmission in frog skeletal muscles. They found that
  exposure to these inhibitors led to an increase in the quantum content of the end-plate
  potential, followed by conduction block in intramuscular motor nerve branches. These
  changes resulted from the inhibition of a sodium pump in the motor nerve axons and
  their endings, affecting the release of neurotransmitter and the overall transmission
  process.
