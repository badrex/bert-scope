tldr: The author presents a theory for amphoteric electrolytes and explains how to
  calculate their ionization. They demonstrate that the ionized proportion remains
  constant in a series of amphoteric electrolytes with a constant product of their
  acid and base constants. The author also discusses the influence of substituents
  on the dissociation constants of acids and bases and the effect of freezing-point
  depression in amphoteric electrolytes.
