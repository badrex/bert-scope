tldr: This study investigates the mechanism of water absorption by plant roots, focusing
  on the effects of hydrostatic pressure gradients. The researchers used tomato plants
  in water culture to test the impact of pressure on water movement through the root
  cortex. They found that pressure differences caused a greater rate of water movement
  than corresponding differences in osmotic potential, suggesting that mass flow may
  play a role in addition to diffusion. This work provides a foundation for understanding
  root function in water and nutrient absorption.
