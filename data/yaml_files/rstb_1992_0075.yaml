tldr: This study investigates how cells in the anteroventral cochlear nucleus (AVCN)
  process complex sounds by analyzing their sensitivity to spatiotemporal discharge
  patterns. The researchers developed a model to test the idea that these neurons
  perform a coincidence detection or cross-correlation on their inputs from auditory
  nerve (AN) fibers. The model shows that a coincidence mechanism acting on a group
  of inputs with different characteristic frequencies can produce the observed sensitivity
  in the AVCN. This mechanism may help the auditory system process temporal information
  in complex sounds.
