tldr: The authors studied the development of the trypanosome causing disease in humans
  in Nyasaland in the tsetse fly species Glossina morsitans. They found that the average
  time required for the cycle of development of the trypanosome in G. morsitans is
  around 24 days. The study highlights the importance of understanding the transmission
  and development of the trypanosome in tsetse flies to control the spread of the
  disease.
