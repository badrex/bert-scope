tldr: This article discusses the progress made in understanding the functions of the
  prefrontal cortex, focusing on the cognitive and emotional processes it subserves.
  It highlights advances in anatomical organization, comparative studies between humans
  and monkeys, and the relationship between neuronal activity and behavior. The article
  also addresses discrepancies in functional organization between species and the
  importance of using comparable tests of cognition in both humans and non-human primates.
