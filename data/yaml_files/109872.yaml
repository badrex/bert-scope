tldr: The author, Humphry Davy, conducted experiments on the combustion of gaseous
  mixtures and discovered a method to preserve a continued light in inflammable gas
  and air mixtures without flame. He found that platinum wire could glow in these
  mixtures, and this phenomenon could be used to light coal-miners' safety lamps in
  non-explosive mixtures and indicate the state of the air in mines.
