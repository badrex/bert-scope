tldr: The authors conducted experiments injecting rats and mice with 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene,
  a carcinogenic substance, to study the development of peritoneal tumors. They observed
  that the substance caused tumors in the peritoneum of the animals, which is the
  lining of the abdominal cavity. The tumors grew in various forms and stages, providing
  valuable insights into cancer research.
