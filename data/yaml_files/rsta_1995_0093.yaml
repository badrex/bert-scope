tldr: This article explores the use of arrays of discretely coupled nonlinear electronic
  circuits to study spatio-temporal pattern formation in nonlinear dynamical systems.
  The authors review the possibilities of using these circuits to investigate phenomena
  such as spiral wave initiation, Turing pattern formation, and the dynamics of coupled
  layers supporting Turing and Hopf modes. The study of these patterns and chaos in
  cellular neural networks can have applications in neurophysiology and cardiophysiology.
