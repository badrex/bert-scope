tldr: Jacques Monod was a pioneering biologist and molecular biologist known for his
  work on bacterial growth, enzyme synthesis, and the concept of induced enzyme synthesis.
  His research on the interaction of two carbon sources led to the discovery of catabolic
  repression and the understanding of how genes are regulated. Monod's work laid the
  foundation for modern molecular biology.
