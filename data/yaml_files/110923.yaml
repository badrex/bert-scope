tldr: P. W. Barlow investigates the power consumed in overcoming the inertia of railway
  trains and the resistance of the air to their motion at high velocities. He compares
  the theoretical velocities of trains with those observed in experiments and discusses
  the power loss in locomotive engines and atmospheric railways. Barlow concludes
  that the resistance of the air is less than previously estimated, and the main resistance
  in railway progression arises from the air being in motion.
