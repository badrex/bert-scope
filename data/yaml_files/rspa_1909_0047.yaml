tldr: The author conducted experiments on the variation of the capacity of condensers
  with solid dielectrics, exploring the influence of potential difference and time.
  They investigated the effect of temperature on the results and found that the capacity
  of the ebonite condenser fell slowly at constant temperature, while after a fall
  in temperature, its capacity slowly increased.
