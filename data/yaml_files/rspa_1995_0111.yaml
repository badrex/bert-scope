tldr: The author discovers supplemental invariant Poisson structures that are incompatible
  with the original Poisson structure for an arbitrary completely integrable Hamiltonian
  system. The study provides a complete classification of these invariant Poisson
  structures and proves the instability of their compatibility property. This research
  contributes to the understanding of bi-Hamiltonian systems and the properties of
  compatible pairs of Poisson structures.
