tldr: The author conducted experiments on Antirrhinum majus plants to study the inheritance
  of flower colors. They discovered that the inheritance of corolla colors can be
  represented by factors, following the Mendelian inheritance. The five distinguishable
  types of flower colors are white, yellow, ivory, magenta, and crimson, with different
  combinations of factors determining each color. The study provides insights into
  the genetics of plant breeding and the inheritance of traits.
