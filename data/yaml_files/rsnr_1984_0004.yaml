tldr: The article discusses the life and work of Sir William Brooke O'Shaughnessy,
  an Anglo-Indian forensic chemist who made significant contributions to the field
  of forensic chemistry in the 19th century. O'Shaughnessy was a student of Matthew
  J. B. Orfila, a pioneer in toxicology, and played a crucial role in establishing
  forensic chemistry as a scientific discipline in Britain. He developed new methods
  for detecting and analyzing poisons, including nitric acid and iodine, and worked
  to improve the standards of evidence in criminal trials. His work in identifying
  and combating the adulteration of candy with toxic substances helped protect public
  health and set a precedent for future legislation.
