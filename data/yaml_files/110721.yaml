tldr: J.P. Joule investigated the relationship between the amount of heat produced
  by voltaic electricity and the resistance of different metals. He used a coil of
  wire in a jar of water with a thermometer to measure temperature changes and a galvanometer
  to estimate the quantity of electricity. Joule's research also suggested that the
  heat produced by the combustion of zinc in oxygen is due to resistance to electric
  conduction.
