tldr: The authors describe a method to measure the absolute indices of refraction
  in strained glass by observing the deviation of light passing through a slab of
  glass under flexure. They also discuss the stress-optical coefficients for vertically
  and horizontally polarized rays and present the results of their experiments on
  two different types of glass. The authors propose a new unit, the "brewster," to
  express stress-optical coefficients.
