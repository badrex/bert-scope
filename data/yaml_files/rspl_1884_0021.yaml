tldr: The author, Charles Tomlinson, investigates the phenomenon of boiling in a vessel
  contained in a water bath. He discusses historical experiments and observations,
  and through his own experiments, he concludes that the inferior temperature of water
  in a tube is due to evaporation. This study contributes to the understanding of
  boiling phenomena and the role of evaporation in heat transfer.
