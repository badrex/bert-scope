tldr: The author investigates the circulation and vortex motion of air in a tube caused
  by the vibration of air. They describe the behavior of a real gas in a tube and
  the effect of vortex motion on forces between objects in the vibrating gas. The
  author also discusses the use of smoke particles to observe air movements and the
  impact of frequency on the behavior of particles in the air.
