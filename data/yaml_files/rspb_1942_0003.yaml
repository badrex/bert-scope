tldr: The author investigates the nuclear apparatus of bacteria, specifically the
  chromatinic dumbbell-shaped bodies, using the Feulgen process. These bodies are
  found in resting bacterial spores and vegetative cells from young cultures. The
  author concludes that these dumbbell-shaped bodies are comparable to the chromosomes
  of plant and animal cells, and they grow and divide with the organism, preceding
  the division of the cell.
