tldr: This article explores the relationship between energy use and the rate of species
  and population extinctions. The author argues that total energy consumption can
  serve as an indicator of global extinction rates, as it is correlated with the scale
  of human enterprise and its environmental impact. The author suggests that by analyzing
  historical data on energy use and extinction rates, current rates can be estimated,
  providing a valuable tool for understanding and addressing the ongoing loss of global
  biodiversity.
