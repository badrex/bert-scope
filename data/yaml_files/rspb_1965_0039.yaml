tldr: The study investigates the locomotion behavior of small groups of fibroblasts
  in tissue culture. It observes that fibroblasts tend to disperse and move away from
  each other while maintaining some contact. The findings suggest that the cells'
  movement is influenced by contact inhibition and the orientation of the substrate
  they move on. This research provides insights into the understanding of cell behavior
  and tissue growth in vitro.
