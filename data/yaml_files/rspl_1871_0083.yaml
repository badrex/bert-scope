tldr: The author proposes a theory that explains volcanic heat as a result of the
  secular cooling of the Earth, which causes the Earth's solid crust to sink and crush,
  transforming the work into heat. This heat, combined with the access of water, leads
  to volcanic eruptions. The author also discusses the relationship between volcanic
  phenomena, seismic phenomena, and mountain elevation, and how these are all due
  to the play of one set of cosmical forces.
