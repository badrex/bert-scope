tldr: The authors discuss the rotation of molecules in fields of octahedral symmetry,
  a problem with important applications in the theory of specific heats and dielectric
  constants in solids. They analyze Schrödinger's equation for diatomic molecules
  and explore various methods to solve the equation, providing essential steps for
  understanding molecular orbitals and energy states.
