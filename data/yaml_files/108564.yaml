tldr: The author, George Newport, discovered that the spermatozoon of the frog penetrates
  directly into the substance of the egg's envelopes, coming into contact with the
  membrane that encloses the yolk. This finding challenges the previous belief that
  the impregnating influence was transmitted through the egg's envelopes and supports
  the idea that the spermatozoon's influence on the egg during fertilization is direct
  and immediate.
