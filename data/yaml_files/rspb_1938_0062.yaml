tldr: This study investigates the nature of olfactory conditioning in parasitic insects,
  specifically Nemeritis canescens, and how they are attracted to the odour of their
  host. The researchers found that insects can be conditioned to respond to a new
  odour, even without direct contact with the new host. This conditioning can occur
  during the pre-imaginal stage or in the adult stage after emergence. The study also
  explores the duration of the conditioning effect, the effect of varying exposure
  periods, and the process of deconditioning or the experimental extinction of the
  conditioning effect.
