tldr: The authors conducted shock-wave experiments to study the recombination of atomic
  hydrogen and its temperature dependence. They found that the rate constant for recombination
  with hydrogen atoms is about ten times larger than with other species and has a
  steep inverse dependence on temperature above 4000 K. The results indicate that
  the assumption of equality between the equilibrium constant and the ratio of the
  rate constants for dissociation and recombination is valid throughout the region
  of non-equilibrium dissociation and at all temperatures in the shock waves examined.
