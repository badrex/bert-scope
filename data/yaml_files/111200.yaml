tldr: The author, William Brinton, studied the dentate body of the cerebellum and
  its anatomical structure. He concluded that the dentate body forms a tubular investment
  around the extremity of the processus e cerebello ad testem, connected with the
  opposite body by a commissure of grey matter. The dentate body receives fibers from
  the cerebro-cerebellar peduncle and radiates fibers to the various lobes of the
  cerebellum. Brinton suggests that the dentate body's anatomical structure and relations
  are best understood as a cerebrocerebellar ganglion.
