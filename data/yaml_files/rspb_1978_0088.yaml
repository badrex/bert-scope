tldr: This study examines dendro-dendritic and reciprocal synapses in the primate
  motor cortex using electron microscopy. The researchers found that these synapses
  have a typical structure, with presynaptic and postsynaptic membrane specializations
  and synaptic vesicles in the presynaptic process. They also discovered that presynaptic
  dendrites receive a high density of synapses, both asymmetric and symmetrical, and
  that dendro-dendritic synapses are less common than afferent synapses. The findings
  contribute to our understanding of the complex synaptic organization in the primate
  motor cortex.
