tldr: Researchers developed a method to determine the directions and frequencies of
  wave trains in the sea using a shipborne wave recorder and Doppler shifts. The study
  found that the mean frequency of waves varies sinusoidally with the ship's course,
  allowing for the identification of predominant wave directions. This method helps
  in understanding the growth and propagation of sea waves, especially in open ocean
  areas where the highest waves are generated.
