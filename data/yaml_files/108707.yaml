tldr: The author, George Bowdler Buckton, describes the isolation and properties of
  organo-metals, specifically mercuric, stannic, and plumbic ethyls. He discusses
  various methods for their isolation and their reactions with other compounds, such
  as iodides and chlorides. The author also explores the potential of these organo-metals
  in further research and their applications in the field of chemistry.
