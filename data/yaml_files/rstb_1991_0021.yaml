tldr: The article discusses the regenerative response of central nervous system (CNS)
  axons after traumatic lesions and the role of myelin-associated neurite growth inhibitors
  in hindering regeneration. The authors found that neutralizing these inhibitors
  allowed long-distance regeneration of CNS axons in rats. They also explored the
  importance of neurotrophic factors and local lesion responses in the regeneration
  process.
