tldr: The author discusses the concept of molecular recognition of transition states
  in enzyme reactions. They explain the importance of understanding how enzymes selectively
  stabilize transition states for their reactions and the role of molecular recognition
  in this process. The author also describes their approach to studying the interactions
  that stabilize transition states and the potential implications for designing analogues
  or receptors.
