tldr: 'This article presents asymptotic expansions for hypergeometric functions that
  arise in gas-flow theory. The authors develop two types of formulae: elementary
  ones involving exponential or circular functions and singular at the sonic value,
  and uniform approximation formulae near the sonic value. These formulae provide
  7-figure accuracy over the physically significant range of the argument for large
  values of the order. The coefficients are tabulated for specific cases, and the
  results can be used to calculate solutions of the differential equations for gas
  flows in two dimensions.'
