tldr: The study investigates the role of calcium ions in the release of acetylcholine
  from motor nerve terminals. The researchers found that calcium ions directly increase
  the release of the neurotransmitter, rather than indirectly affecting it by facilitating
  nerve impulse propagation or increasing the amplitude of the terminal nerve spike.
  This discovery helps to understand the importance of calcium ions in neuromuscular
  transmission.
