tldr: The authors present a theoretical foundation for the open-resonator method of
  measuring permittivity and loss-tangent of dielectric materials. They derive simplified
  formulae for the electric and magnetic field vectors using an exact solution of
  Maxwell's equations and apply a variational formula to obtain an accurate formula
  for the resonant frequency of an open resonator with spherical mirrors and a dielectric
  slab. This work provides a reliable method for measuring permittivity and offers
  improvements in accuracy and convenience compared to conventional closed-resonator
  methods.
