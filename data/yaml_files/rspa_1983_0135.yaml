tldr: The authors develop a theory for an ideal time-independent material, the progressively
  fracturing solid, which loses stiffness during loading but remains elastic during
  unloading. They introduce a loading function and a fracture surface in deformation
  space to distinguish between loading, unloading, and reloading. The theory is based
  on the assumption of path independence in the small, leading to a flow rule for
  the fracture stress decrement and expressions for the changes in moduli accompanying
  a change in deformation.
