tldr: The article describes seismic refraction and reflection experiments conducted
  by H.M.S. Challenger in the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian Ocean, and Mediterranean Sea
  between 1950 and 1953. The authors present results for the geological structure
  of the oceans, as interpreted from seismic data, and discuss the methods of analyzing
  refracted wave arrivals observed in deep-water seismic experiments. The study provides
  valuable insights into the Earth's subsurface structure and the challenges of conducting
  seismic measurements at sea.
