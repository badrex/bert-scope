tldr: The authors present a formal derivation of the general solution to a classical
  Boltzmann equation, which describes the evolution of a gas towards a Maxwellian
  equilibrium state. They construct a countable ensemble of particular solutions called
  pure solutions and combine them to form the general solution. The study focuses
  on the relaxation of non-equilibrium distribution functions to Maxwellian form and
  the formation of the high-energy tail of the velocity distribution.
