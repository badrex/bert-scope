tldr: The authors studied the unfolding transitions and folding energy of the giant
  protein titin, responsible for muscle elasticity. They found two unfolding transitions,
  both cooperative, and the second transition involved complete unfolding of immunoglobulin-
  and fibronectin-like domains. The folding energy associated with this transition
  is comparable to the energy required to extend titin molecules in situ, suggesting
  a possible role in muscle elasticity.
