tldr: The authors conducted experiments and took photographs of black and grey soap
  films to study their properties and behavior. They observed various stages of thinning
  and the formation of different shades of grey, which they attributed to changes
  in film thickness. Their findings provide insights into the behavior of soap films
  and their potential applications in physics and optics.
