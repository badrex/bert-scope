tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear stability of boundary layers in fluid
  dynamics, focusing on disturbances of various sizes. The study considers the largest
  size of disturbance that can be dealt with, near the lower branch of the neutral
  curve, and explores the implications of decreasing the disturbance size. The findings
  have implications for understanding the behavior of boundary layers in various flow
  situations.
