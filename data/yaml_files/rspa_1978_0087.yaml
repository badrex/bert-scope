tldr: The author investigates the non-uniqueness of the machining process and explores
  different slip-line field solutions. They find that the process is not uniquely
  defined and that the range of possible solutions varies with the tool rake angle
  and interfacial shear stress. The author also discusses the role of chip curl and
  the limitations of slip-line field models in describing the machining process.
