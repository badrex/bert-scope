tldr: The authors discovered that the mevalonate shunt operates in wheat plants, allowing
  for the preferential utilization of acetate for the synthesis of long-chain fatty
  alcohols with a chain length more suitable for membrane construction. This finding
  demonstrates that the mevalonate shunt is not a minor pathway but can route isopentenyl
  pyrophosphate carbon atoms away from the sterol pathway under certain conditions.
