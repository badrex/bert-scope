tldr: Thomas Young presents a finite and exact expression for the refraction of an
  atmosphere similar to Earth's. The new equation considers the pressure of the atmosphere
  and provides a more accurate representation of atmospheric refraction, closely aligning
  with previous tables and the Nautical Almanac.
