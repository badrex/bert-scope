tldr: The author examines the momentum of light in a refracting medium, challenging
  the results of Minkowski and Abraham. They find that neither answer gives the total
  momentum density and that both relate to physically interesting quantities. The
  correct answer for a broad wave in a uniform medium is given by a specific formula,
  and for weak refraction, it is approximately equal to the average of the Abraham
  and Minkowski results.
