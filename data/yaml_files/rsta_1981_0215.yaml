tldr: This article discusses the historical discovery of interstellar molecules through
  optical methods and the importance of further optical work to identify molecules
  without an electric dipole moment. It also highlights recent observations of hydrogen
  quadrupole spectrum in the Orion nebula and the potential for discovering more molecules
  through interstellar shock waves and dissociative recombination processes.
