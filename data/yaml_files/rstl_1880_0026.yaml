tldr: The author discusses the challenges of dynamo-electric current stability and
  proposes a solution to improve it. By increasing the resistance of the field magnet
  and using a cross wire to divert current, the steadiness of the dynamo-electric
  current can be enhanced. This improvement allows for more efficient and safer use
  of dynamo-electric machines in electric illumination and other applications.
