tldr: The authors studied the photochemistry of aqueous solutions of Fe(II) and found
  that photoelectron detachment occurs from ferrous and ferrocyanide ions. They used
  nitrous oxide as a specific scavenger of aquated electrons and discovered that hydrogen
  and nitrogen are produced in the process. This research provides insights into the
  photochemical reactions of ferrous and ferrocyanide ions in aqueous solutions.
