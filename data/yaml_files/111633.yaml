tldr: The author investigates the structure of the chorda dorsalis in various fish
  species and its role in the development of the vertebral column. They describe the
  four layers of the chorda dorsalis and how it contributes to the formation of vertebral
  bodies in fish. The study also discusses the differences in chorda dorsalis structure
  and function in various fish groups and its implications for understanding vertebrate
  development.
