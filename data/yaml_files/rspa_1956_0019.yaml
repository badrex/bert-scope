tldr: This article presents an experimental investigation of the multiple scattering
  of 4.5 MeV electrons by various foils, such as aluminum, copper, molybdenum, silver,
  and platinum. The results are compared with the Moliere theory, showing good agreement
  in the region of plural scattering. The study provides insights into the angular
  distribution of scattered electrons and helps improve our understanding of particle
  interactions.
