tldr: John F. W. Herschel observed nebulae and star clusters using a twenty-feet reflector
  at Slough between 1825 and 1833. He encountered various difficulties in observing
  these celestial objects due to their faintness and the challenges of the atmosphere.
  He noticed a peculiar atmospheric phenomenon that could be connected to the aurora
  borealis. Herschel also discussed the possibility of minute stars being part of
  planetary systems within nebulae.
