tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of various gases on the
  development of microorganisms, including Bacillus pyocyaneus, Koch's Comma Spirillum,
  and Finkler's Comma Spirillum. They found that carbonic anhydride had the most destructive
  influence on the microorganisms, while hydrogen had the least impact. The results
  suggest that microorganisms may reach their maximum activity when the gaseous products
  they produce are removed by an indifferent gas like hydrogen.
