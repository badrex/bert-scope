tldr: The author analyzes the spatio-temporal patterns in natural plankton communities
  and interprets them as non-equilibrium solutions of nonlinear interaction-advection
  systems. The study considers factors such as light sensitivity, nutrient availability,
  and the effects of external forces like fish predation. The research provides insights
  into the formation and dynamics of plankton patterns, which have implications for
  understanding water quality, carbon cycling, and climate.
