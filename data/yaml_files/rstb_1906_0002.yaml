tldr: The author describes a new type of fossil plant, Sphenophyllum Fertile, discovered
  in the Lower Coal-Measures. The plant has unique features, such as a distinct fructification
  structure and spores that differ from other known members of the Sphenophyllales
  group. The discovery provides valuable insights into the classification and evolution
  of ancient vascular cryptogams.
