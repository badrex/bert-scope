  Equations
scientific_discipline: Physics > General relativity
semantic_tags:
- General relativity
- Einstein's field equations
- Axially symmetric solutions
- Weyl's line element
- Newtonian gravitational potential
tldr: The authors present a general solution in closed form for axially symmetric
  static solutions of Einstein's vacuum field equations, using Weyl's line element.
  They demonstrate the solution's compatibility with the equations and provide examples
  of its application, such as finding potential functions and associated functions
  in the line element.
