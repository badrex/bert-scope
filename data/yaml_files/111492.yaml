tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted observations on the Mer de Glace glacier,
  confirming previous findings about the swifter flow of central portions of the ice
  stream. He also discovered that the point of maximum motion in a glacier moves from
  side to side depending on the curvature of the valley. Additionally, Tyndall studied
  the bands of white ice on the Glacier du Geant and explained their formation and
  the physical properties of ice, such as its fragility and regelation.
