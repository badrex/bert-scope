tldr: In this paper, John F. W. Herschel explores the chemical actions of the rays
  in the solar spectrum on various substances, both metallic and non-metallic, and
  discusses their impact on photographic processes. He also describes a method to
  create photographic coatings on glass and experiments with different metal salts.
  Furthermore, he investigates the chemical analysis of the solar spectrum and its
  effects on photographic paper, vegetable colors, and the development of an actinograph
  for meteorological purposes.
