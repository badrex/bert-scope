tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the inheritance of traits in plants,
  specifically the "rogue" peas that appear as offspring of cultivated types. They
  found that a segregation of factors takes place in the plant's body, with type elements
  present mainly in the lower parts. This study provides evidence for somatic segregation
  and suggests that rogue plants arising directly from typical plants are derived
  predominantly from the apical pods.
