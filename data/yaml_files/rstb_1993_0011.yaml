tldr: This article discusses the molecular regulation of sexual development in plants,
  focusing on the processes of epigenetic imprinting and self-incompatibility. It
  also explores the role of growth regulators, such as gibberellic acid and cytokinins,
  in sex determination. The article highlights the variety of genetic control systems
  in plants, including X:autosome balance systems and sex chromosomes, and the importance
  of understanding these processes for modifying plant reproductive systems.
