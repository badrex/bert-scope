tldr: This article discusses the chemical reactions between platina and mercury, exploring
  their interaction and the formation of compound metals. The author, Richard Chenevix,
  presents various experiments and observations, including the use of green sulfate
  of iron to precipitate the metals and the effect of different oxidization states
  on the reactions. Chenevix also examines the possibility of metals acting upon each
  other in their metallic state, altering their properties and creating compounds
  that may appear as simple metals.
