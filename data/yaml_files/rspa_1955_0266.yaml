tldr: This article discusses the concept of torsional oscillations in a rotating star
  with a poloidal magnetic field. The authors derive numerical estimates for the period
  of the fundamental mode and explore the implications of these oscillations in relation
  to solar variability. They also consider different forms of the poloidal magnetic
  field and use the Rayleigh-Ritz method to estimate the frequency of the lowest mode.
