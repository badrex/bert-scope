tldr: The authors studied the growth, structure, melting, and solidification of lead
  deposits on molybdenite and carbon substrates. They found that lead nucleates and
  grows as a solid below specific temperatures and as a liquid above those temperatures,
  which are well below the bulk melting point of lead. The electron beam has a significant
  effect on the nucleation of lead particles, and the authors observed the growth
  sequence of lead deposits on both substrates. The study also investigated the influence
  of the substrate on melting and freezing of small lead particles.
