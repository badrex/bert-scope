tldr: The authors designed a high-resolution mass spectrometer to study the photodissociation
  of organic ions in the gas phase. They used an argon-ion laser to irradiate ions
  and distinguished photodissociation from unimolecular dissociation by mechanically
  chopping the laser beam and using phase-sensitive detection. The photodissociation
  of nitrotoluene isomers was investigated, revealing different fragmentation pathways
  from unimolecular dissociations.
