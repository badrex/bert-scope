tldr: The article investigates the single-channel and whole-cell currents evoked by
  acetylcholine in dissociated sympathetic neurons of the rat. The researchers found
  that the single-channel conductance is 35 pS in normal medium containing 1 mM calcium
  and 51 pS in the absence of calcium. The currents show strong inward rectification
  with no outward current being detectable. Outward single-channel currents are detectable
  in isolated outside-out patches.
