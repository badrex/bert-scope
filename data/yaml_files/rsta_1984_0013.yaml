tldr: This article examines the relative contributions of the mantle, oceanic crust,
  and continental crust to the formation of oceanic island arc magmas. It explores
  the role of metasomatism of the mantle wedge by fluids from the subducted slab and
  the involvement of sedimentary materials in the genesis of these magmas. The study
  emphasizes the importance of understanding the various potential magma source components
  in different oceanic arc systems.
