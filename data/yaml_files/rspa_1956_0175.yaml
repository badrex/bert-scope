tldr: The authors investigated the catalytic activity of 13 oxides in the H2-D2 exchange
  reaction, finding a correlation between the electronic configuration of the metal
  ion and the catalytic activity. Oxides with a suitable number of impaired d-electrons
  exhibited high activity, while those with no unpaired d-electrons or too many had
  low activity. The results suggest that hydrogen behaves similarly at metal and oxide
  surfaces, providing a common motif for catalysis by these solids.
