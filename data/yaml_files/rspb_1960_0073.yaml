tldr: The authors discuss the unique marine algae and lichen communities found in
  the subantarctic cold temperature zone. They highlight the presence of Hildenbrandia
  lecanellierii and Caloplaca sublobulata in these regions and emphasize the importance
  of studying these organisms for understanding phytogeography and zonation of life
  on marine shores. They also touch upon the influence of glacial periods on the distribution
  of antarctic-type shelf fauna.
