tldr: This study examines the biogeographical patterns of hydrothermal-vent fauna
  in the eastern Pacific Ocean, focusing on the differences between the fauna of the
  Juan de Fuca and East Pacific Rise systems. The authors find that the fauna of the
  Juan de Fuca Ridge has formed an endemic assemblage of lower diversity, suggesting
  low rates of speciation. The study provides insights into the dispersal and evolution
  of these unique organisms, which are adapted to chemosynthetic productivity in their
  extreme environments.
