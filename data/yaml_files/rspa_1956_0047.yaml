tldr: The authors exposed counting diamonds to nuclear radiation in a reactor and
  observed a reduction in counting efficiency proportional to the radiation dosage.
  The optical absorption also increased, and annealing at red heat only partially
  restored the counting and optical transparency. The results are interpreted in terms
  of intrinsic charge traps and additional traps produced by neutrons, indicating
  that the traps created by neutron irradiation differ from the intrinsic traps in
  diamonds.
