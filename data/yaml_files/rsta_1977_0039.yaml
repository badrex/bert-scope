tldr: This article presents an outline of lunar chronology and evolution based on
  isotopic parent-daughter systems and 4040. The authors analyze samples from Apollo
  and Luna missions, discussing the accumulation and bulk composition of the Moon.
  They provide a general outline of lunar chronology, focusing on mare volcanism,
  the terminal lunar cataclysm, and the fossil lunar magnetic field. The study also
  explains the methodology of Rb-Sr analysis and its application to lunar samples.
