tldr: This article describes an experimental investigation into the flow of marble
  under pressure. The researchers subjected marble columns to various pressures and
  observed the deformation and changes in the marble's properties. The results showed
  that the marble's strength decreased after deformation, and the rate of deformation
  affected the resulting rock's strength. The study provides insights into the processes
  that cause rock deformation in Earth's crust.
