tldr: This paper explores the distribution of stress in an infinite elastic solid
  when time-dependent body forces act on certain regions of the solid. The authors
  derive a general solution using four-dimensional Fourier transforms and apply it
  to various problems, including two-dimensional and axially symmetrical cases. The
  study is important for understanding stress distribution in soil mechanics, foundation
  theory, and other branches of applied mathematics.
