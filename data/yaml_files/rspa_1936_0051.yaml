tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the disintegration of boron under
  proton bombardment. They discovered that the energy release in this process is 8.6
  MeV, which is in agreement with other nuclear reactions. The study also revealed
  that the disintegration of boron into three alpha particles is a rare event, and
  the energy distribution among the products has not yet been fully explained. This
  research provides valuable insights into the understanding of nuclear reactions
  and energy release.
