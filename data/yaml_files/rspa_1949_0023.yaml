tldr: The authors study the shear strength and instability of crystal structures using
  bubble rafts as a model. They find that the maximum shear strain in a perfect lattice
  is less than that deduced from a simple sine law approximation. The presence of
  dislocations in metals is discussed, explaining their low strengths and the role
  of dislocations in plastic deformation.
