tldr: This study investigates the thermoluminescence properties of squalane, a branched
  alkane that freezes to form a rigid glass. The authors discovered four distinct
  peaks in the glow curve, with one peak associated with the presence of molecular
  oxygen. They also found that the thermoluminescence mechanism involves two types
  of traps and proposed a simple model for the process. The findings provide insights
  into the behavior of saturated hydrocarbons and their potential applications in
  thermoluminescent materials.
