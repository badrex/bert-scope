tldr: This study examines the infectivity of tsetse flies (Glossina morsitans) in
  Nyasaland and identifies the species of disease-producing trypanosomes they carry.
  The research found that 13.5 out of every 1,000 tsetse flies were infective with
  pathogenic trypanosomes, with T. brucei vel rhodesiense being the main cause of
  the Human Trypanosome Disease of Nyasaland. The study suggests that eradicating
  wild game in the area could help prevent the spread of the disease.
