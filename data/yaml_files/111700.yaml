tldr: The authors, Edward Frankland and B. Duppa, discovered a new compound called
  boric ethide. They described its properties, such as its colorless, mobile liquid
  form, pungent odor, and its reaction with water, oxygen, and other substances. They
  also mentioned its potential for oxidation and the formation of diethylate of boric
  dioxyethide, a new compound with interesting properties.
