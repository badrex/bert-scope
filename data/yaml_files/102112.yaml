tldr: Dr. Lister conducted experiments to study the freezing of sea water and fresh
  water ice. He found that sea water ice took longer to form and lasted longer than
  fresh water ice. He also suggested that the nitre found in Egypt might be formed
  from the urine of animals living in saltwater lakes, as the composition of the water
  in these lakes is similar to that of factitious Sal Armoniac.
