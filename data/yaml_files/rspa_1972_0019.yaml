tldr: 'The authors studied the interaction of molybdenum carbonyl and carbon tetrachloride
  in a suitable solvent, which generates free radicals and initiates free-radical
  polymerization. They found that the process involves two distinct reactions: ligand
  exchange without change in oxidation state and oxidation by the halide. The authors
  used electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to determine the nature of the final
  oxidation state and followed the kinetics of its formation, providing a detailed
  understanding of the overall reaction.'
