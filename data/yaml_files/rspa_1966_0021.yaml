tldr: This article explores the time dependence of scintillation intensity in aromatic
  materials, focusing on the prompt and delayed components of light emission. The
  authors develop a theoretical model for the time dependence of scintillation emission,
  considering factors such as diffusion, singlet and triplet excitations, and bimolecular
  reactions. They also provide an experimental interpretation of pulse-shapes, allowing
  for a better understanding of the scintillation process.
