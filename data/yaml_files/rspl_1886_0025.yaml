tldr: This article compares the apparent inequalities of short periods in sunspot
  areas with diurnal declination-ranges at Toronto and Prague. The authors discuss
  the connections between these solar and terrestrial phenomena, analyzing their similarities
  and differences in terms of duration, phase, and constancy of type. While the study
  does not conclusively prove a connection between these phenomena, the observed similarities
  suggest that further research may reveal physical links between solar activity and
  terrestrial magnetism.
