tldr: The authors study the Nuanetsi Igneous Province in Southern Rhodesia, describing
  its geological features, including the late-Karroo ring complexes, and providing
  insights into the tectonic history of the region. They discuss the Karroo sedimentation,
  volcanics, and associated dyke rocks, as well as the late-Karroo intrusive rocks,
  such as the Main Granophyre and gabbros found in the ring complexes.
