tldr: The author conducted extensive experiments on the meteorology of the Lake District
  of Cumberland and Westmoreland, focusing on the fall of rain at various heights
  up to 3166 feet above sea level. The study found that the Lake District experiences
  a higher and more equable climate than other areas, with the highest rainfall occurring
  at higher altitudes. The author also discussed the temperature variations in the
  region and the impact of mountains on local climate.
