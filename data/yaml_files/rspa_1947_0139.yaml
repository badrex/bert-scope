tldr: This article explores the resonance theory and its application to atmospheric
  oscillations. The authors describe the trapping of energy between a certain stratum
  and the ground due to tide-producing forces and discuss the types of free oscillations
  an atmosphere with a given temperature distribution may possess. They also present
  numerical calculations made with a differential analyzer to determine the extent
  to which the resonance theory restricts possible temperature variations in the atmosphere.
