tldr: The author presents a method for classifying and analyzing quadratic forms containing
  more than three indeterminates. They introduce the concept of concomitants, which
  are derived matrices used to determine the order and genera of these forms. The
  author also discusses the primary and secondary divisors of quadratic forms and
  their importance in classification.
