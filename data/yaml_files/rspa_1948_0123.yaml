tldr: The authors reformulate the theory of the anomalous skin effect in metals using
  the general methods of the theory of metals. They obtain explicit solutions that
  provide a detailed discussion of the effects of frequency and temperature on the
  skin effect. The results show that the electric field is not exponential, and the
  classical concept of the complex refractive index loses its physical meaning. Instead,
  the surface impedance is introduced as a unified description of the phenomena, valid
  for the whole frequency range.
