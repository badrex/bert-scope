tldr: The authors conducted experiments to improve the technique for detecting and
  distinguishing alpha-particle and proton tracks in photographic emulsions. They
  tested various types of plates and found that the new emulsion R2 provided better
  results, with fewer background grains and a higher number of grains along a track.
  The authors developed a criterion to differentiate between alpha-particle and proton
  tracks based on the mean separation of grains, allowing for more accurate identification
  of particles.
