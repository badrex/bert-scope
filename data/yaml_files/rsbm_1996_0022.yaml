tldr: This biographical memoir recounts the life of Claude Rimington, a notable biochemist
  and scientist, who made significant contributions to the fields of chemistry, natural
  history, and the humanities. Born in London in 1902, Rimington grew up in Hertfordshire
  and attended The Haberdasher Aske's Boys' School. His interests in literature, chemistry,
  and natural history led him to pursue a career in science. After a brief interruption
  due to health issues, Rimington attended Emmanuel College, Cambridge, where he studied
  chemistry, physics, and botany. He later focused on biochemistry and worked on the
  phosphorylation of proteins and the structure of phosphoproteins. Rimington also
  had a passion for art, music, and literature, which he pursued alongside his scientific
  career. Throughout his life, he traveled extensively, including visits to Norway,
  Denmark, and South Africa, where he conducted research and made important connections
  in the scientific community.
