tldr: The authors, Judd and Armstrong, explore the matrix factorizations of the Coulomb
  interaction between electrons in atoms. They discovered that for most cases, it
  is possible to factorize the matrix elements of operators representing parts of
  the Coulomb interaction. This simplification is achieved by separating electrons
  into two spaces based on their spin orientation and coupling them through the irreducible
  representations of the group they belong to. The findings provide a better understanding
  of atomic spectroscopy and the use of continuous groups in the field.
