tldr: The authors studied the component glycerides of cow and buffalo milk fats and
  found that the main source of milk fats is glycerides in the blood entering the
  lactating gland. They discovered that the oleo- (or other unsaturated) groups in
  these glycerides are transformed into acyl groups with shorter carbon chains, such
  as butyric acid (C4). This research supports the idea that the presence of unusual
  amounts of acetic and associated lower fatty acids in the blood of ruminant animals
  leads to conditions in the lactating gland that favor the conversion of oleo- into
  short-chain glycerides.
