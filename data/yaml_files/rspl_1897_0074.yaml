tldr: The author studied the morphology and development of sporangia in all four living
  genera of Marattiaceae, including Angiopteris, Dancea, Marattia, and Kaulfussia.
  They found that the sporangia have a substantial unity of type in their development
  and that the Eusporangiate condition is best adapted for maturing large numbers
  of spores. The author also discussed the theoretical question of whether synangia
  are a result of coalescence of sporangia, leaving the question open for further
  discussion.
