tldr: The study investigates how life expectancy and egg load affect the oviposition
  decisions of a solitary parasitoid, Venturia canescens. Researchers found that wasps
  with a reduced life expectancy and higher egg loads are more likely to lay eggs
  in low-quality hosts. This demonstrates that parasitoids can adjust their oviposition
  behavior based on their life expectancy and resources available for reproduction.
