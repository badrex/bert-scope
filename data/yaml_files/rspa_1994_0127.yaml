tldr: This article presents analytical solutions for the crack tip region in hydraulic
  fracturing, focusing on fracture width and pressure when a power-law fluid drives
  a plane strain fracture in an impermeable linear elastic solid. The study finds
  an intermediate asymptotic solution with a singularity weaker than the inverse square
  root singularity of linear elastic fracture mechanics, and provides a useful approximation
  for the finite crack case.
