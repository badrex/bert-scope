tldr: This article discusses the structure of proteins, specifically the dimensions
  and configurations of the amide group and the N-H-0 hydrogen bonds. The authors
  use X-ray diffraction analyses of crystals of amino acids, peptides, and other organic
  compounds to determine the interatomic distances and bond angles in the amide group.
  They also explore the planarity of the amide group and the dimensions and directional
  characteristics of N-H-0 hydrogen bonds, which play a significant role in the molecular
  arrangement of proteins.
