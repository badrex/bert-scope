tldr: The authors investigate the demarcation current in mammalian nerves and consider
  it as a concentration cell. They study the effects of tap water and saline solutions
  on nerve conductivity, resistance, and the demarcation current. The findings suggest
  that the demarcation current is due to a balance between two osmotic processes,
  one at the cross-section and one at the longitudinal surface of the nerve.
