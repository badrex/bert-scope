tldr: The study investigates the electrical activity and colonial behavior in eight
  species of Hexacorallia corals. The researchers found that a single electrical stimulus
  evoked a single electrical potential, and these potentials were responsible for
  controlling colonial polyp retraction. The nerve net pulses were conducted without
  decrement over large areas of the colony at a velocity of 15-25 cm/s at 25°C. The
  results suggest that interneural facilitation effects may not be significant in
  determining the spread of excitation in coral nerve nets, and a new explanation
  for colonial polyp retraction patterns is proposed.
