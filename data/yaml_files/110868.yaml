tldr: This paper presents an extensive study of tides on the coast of Ireland, conducted
  in connection with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland. The author, George Biddell Airy,
  collected over 200,000 observations and analyzed them to determine the mean height
  of the sea, diurnal and semidiurnal tide patterns, and the effects of the sun and
  moon on tides. The study provides valuable insights into the complex nature of tidal
  patterns and their relationship to geographical locations.
