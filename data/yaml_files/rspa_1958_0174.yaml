tldr: The authors investigated the paramagnetic resonance of S-state ions in calcium
  fluoride, focusing on manganese ions. They observed a cubic-field Stark splitting
  and a fluorine hyperfine structure due to covalent bonding with fluorine ligands.
  The results provide insights into the incorporation of impurity ions into the crystal
  lattice and the effects of covalent bonding on the crystal field splitting of S-state
  ions.
