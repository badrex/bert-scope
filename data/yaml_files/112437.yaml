tldr: This article explores the optical properties of opals, specifically their ability
  to emit vivid flashes of color when illuminated at different angles. The author
  examines the transmission and reflection spectra of various opals, discovering that
  they emit light due to interference caused by minute striae or fissures within the
  gemstones. The author also explains how these opals can be used in spectroscopy
  and how their unique properties can be observed and studied.
