tldr: The author discovered a unique optical phenomenon in quinine solutions. When
  quinine is mixed with tartaric acid and diluted, it exhibits a lively blue color
  on the surface of the liquid. This color appears regardless of the liquid's thickness
  and is not affected by contact with a denser medium. The phenomenon is not observed
  in other alkaloids like cinchonine or salicine. The author suggests further investigation
  into the property's characteristics and potential involvement of other alkaloids.
