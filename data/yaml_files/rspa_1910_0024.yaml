tldr: The authors analyze the velocity of spherical particles falling through a fluid
  medium and provide a revised formula for calculating the force required to maintain
  the particles' motion. They consider the effects of particle size, molecular collisions,
  and the interactions between particles, leading to a better understanding of the
  behavior of particles in a fluid.
