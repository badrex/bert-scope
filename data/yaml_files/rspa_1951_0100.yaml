tldr: The authors discuss bond energies and bond lengths, focusing on the concept
  of electronegativity. They present a theoretical approach to calculating electronegativities
  and apply it to hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen atoms. The results show that
  sp2 and sp hybrid orbitals have greater electronegativities than hydrogen, while
  an sp3 hybrid orbital of quadrivalent carbon is less electronegative.
