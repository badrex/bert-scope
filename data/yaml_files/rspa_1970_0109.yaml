tldr: The authors discovered oscillations in the Hall effect of tin due to magnetic
  breakdown. They explained these oscillations by considering the migration of electrons
  through magnetic breakdown and the effect of rare collisions on the electrons. The
  theory they developed, which involves the diffusion of electrons on a limited orbit-network,
  accurately predicts the angular variation of oscillatory amplitude.
