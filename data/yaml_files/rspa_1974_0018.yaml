tldr: The authors investigate the statistical mechanics of two-dimensional plasma
  and vortex fluid systems, discovering that they can exist in negative temperature
  states with observable characteristics, such as particle clustering. They also discuss
  the limitations of conventional thermodynamics in these systems and introduce a
  modified model with a finite-range potential to explore the behavior of these systems
  further.
