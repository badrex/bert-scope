tldr: The authors investigated the electronic properties of well-oriented graphites
  using a range of dense materials with high chemical purity. They studied the galvanomagnetic
  and thermoelectric properties in relation to the c-axis distribution function, crystallite
  size, and basal plane dislocation concentration. The results were discussed in terms
  of a multi-carrier model, revealing differences from the behavior of natural crystals.
  The study allowed for the evaluation of ideal defect-free graphite properties and
  provided insights into the effects of neutron irradiation on electronic properties.
