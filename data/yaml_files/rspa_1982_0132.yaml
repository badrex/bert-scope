tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure macroscopic attractive forces between
  two mica cylinders using the dynamic-jump and static-jump methods. The dynamic-jump
  method allows for the direct measurement of attractive forces for distances of separation
  below the static-jump distance, down to a separation very close to the contact point
  of the surfaces. This method provides insights into the static-jump method and offers
  potential for measuring forces in smaller distances of separation.
