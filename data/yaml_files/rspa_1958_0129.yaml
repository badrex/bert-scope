tldr: The authors studied the optical and electrical properties of silver azide, exploring
  its relation to its decomposition. They found that the absorption of light in the
  crystal results in the production of excitons, which dissociate into free electrons
  and positive holes, leading to the initiation of the decomposition process. The
  primary photocurrent was found to be proportional to the strength of the applied
  electric field, and the activation energy for photoconductivity was measured as
  0.36 eV.
