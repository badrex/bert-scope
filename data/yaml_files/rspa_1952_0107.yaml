tldr: The authors investigated the creep behavior of polycrystalline metals, including
  commercial lead, pure lead, and cadmium, under simple shear stress. They found that
  the shear strain follows a cube root of time relationship and that permanent creep
  is absent in these conditions, unlike in tensile tests. The study provides insights
  into the mechanical properties of polycrystalline materials and the role of crystal
  structure in their behavior.
