tldr: The authors investigate the relationship between two-dimensional and three-dimensional
  phenomena in electron diffraction, focusing on Bragg reflexions from single crystal
  lamellae experiencing radially progressive shear strain. They propose a method to
  resolve anomalies in electron diffraction patterns by considering the effects of
  strain on crystal structures.
