tldr: This article presents a mathematical approach to calculate wave resistance for
  various distributions of doublets in fluid dynamics. The author uses Fourier analysis
  to simplify the calculations and provides expressions for wave resistance in different
  scenarios, including deep water and water of finite depth. The findings can be applied
  to improve understanding of wave behavior and design of structures in water.
