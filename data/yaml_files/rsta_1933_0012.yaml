tldr: The author investigates the tightness of teeth and the role of the periodontal
  membrane in maintaining equilibrium. They consider the membrane as a thin, incompressible,
  and isotropic elastic body attached to the tooth and the socket. The study provides
  insights into the displacement of the tooth, strain, and stress in the membrane
  under applied forces, and explains the tightness of teeth using the pressure variations
  in the incompressible medium.
