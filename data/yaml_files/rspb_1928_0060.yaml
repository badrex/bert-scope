tldr: The author conducted feeding experiments on human patients and hamsters infected
  with Chinese Kala Azar to study the transmission of the disease through sandflies.
  They found that the Chinese strain of Leishmania is less infective to Phlebotomus
  sandflies than the Indian strain, which may be correlated with a lower degree of
  virulence in the Chinese strain. The study also showed that the persistence of flagellates
  in the sandflies is dependent on the presence of undigested food material in their
  mid-gut.
