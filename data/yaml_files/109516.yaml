tldr: The author examines the unique anatomy of the Ornithorhynchus paradoxus, also
  known as the platypus, and discovers that its beak is not a mouth but a part added
  to the mouth. The platypus has grinding teeth on each side of its upper and lower
  jaws and a short tongue. Its organ of smell is different from that of other animals,
  with two cavities along the length of its beak, which may help it detect prey in
  water.
