tldr: The article discusses the theoretical analysis of electron resonance spectra
  line widths in solutions. It focuses on the effects of anisotropic interactions
  within molecules and how they cause line broadening. The author presents a method
  to calculate the average width for a composite resonance line using Redfield's density
  matrix theory and operator methods. The results confirm previous findings on line
  broadening in electron resonance spectra.
