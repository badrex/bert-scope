tldr: The authors developed a formula that gives the asymptotic expansion of the Fourier
  transform of a function with a general asymptotic series behavior near the origin.
  This expansion is an extension of a theorem by Olver, who obtained an analogue for
  Fourier transforms of Watson's lemma for Laplace transforms. The method used in
  this paper relies on results on Laplace transforms and a novel technique to handle
  the appearance of divergent integrals in such problems.
