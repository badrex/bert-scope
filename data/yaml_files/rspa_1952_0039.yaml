tldr: The author demonstrates the process of renormalizing scalar electrodynamics
  using the -formalism. They show that by employing specific 5-rowed and 10-rowed
  representations of -matrices, the number of primitive divergent graphs can be reduced.
  The divergent graphs are identified as meson self-energy, photon self-energy, vertex
  parts, -parts, and scattering of light by light graphs. The author explains how
  these difficulties can be overcome and the renormalization of the theory can be
  achieved.
