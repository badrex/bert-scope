tldr: The authors conducted experiments on various organic molecules in dilute solution
  to study their fluorescence and absorption properties. They tested the validity
  of the theoretical relation between radiative lifetime and absorption intensity
  and the mirror-image relation between fluorescence and absorption spectra. The results
  showed that the modified Strickler-Berg equation and the mirror-image relation were
  generally valid, with some exceptions due to changes in nuclear configuration.
