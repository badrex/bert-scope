tldr: This study investigates the inheritance and survival rates of triplet children
  in Great Britain and Ireland. The research examines the Royal Bounty records of
  triplet births and measures the surviving children. The findings reveal differences
  in survival rates between boys and girls, as well as between different types of
  triplet births. The study also discusses the importance of obtaining complete data
  over a uniform range of kinship for accurate results.
