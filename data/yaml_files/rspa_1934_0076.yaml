tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the optical rotatory power of a molecule
  containing four refractive radicals arranged at the corners of an irregular tetrahedron.
  They explain how the rotatory power is determined by the arrangement and properties
  of the refractive centers in the molecule, and provide a formula to calculate it.
  This formula can be applied to various types of optically active compounds, but
  is only suitable for molecules with short, fairly simple radicals.
