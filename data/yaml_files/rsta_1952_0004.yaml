tldr: The authors explore the existence and properties of strictly periodic finite
  stationary waves on the surface of a perfect liquid. They use a method of successive
  approximation to the solution of hydrodynamical equations and find strong evidence
  for the existence of periodic stationary waves and a finite stable wave of greatest
  height. The study also examines the wave pressure on a breakwater and the modification
  of calculations for finite water depth.
