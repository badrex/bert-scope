tldr: This article discusses the role of antioxidants in protecting cells from oxidative
  stress and lipid peroxidation. It highlights the importance of vitamin E as a lipid-soluble,
  chain-breaking antioxidant that works synergistically with water-soluble reducing
  agents like ascorbic acid. The article also explains the mechanisms of different
  antioxidants, including enzymes like catalase and glutathione peroxidase, and how
  they protect cells and biomembranes from damage.
