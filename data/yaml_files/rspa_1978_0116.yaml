tldr: The author examines the development of excitation between atomic or molecular
  energy levels under the influence of monochromatic laser radiation, focusing on
  strictly homogeneous line broadening. The study calculates the ratio of excited
  atoms or molecules to the total number, providing exact expressions for the situation
  when the radiation frequency is equal to the transition frequency. Numerical calculations
  are made for non-zero detuning, and approximate expressions are derived for future
  research on mixed homogeneous and inhomogeneous line-broadening.
