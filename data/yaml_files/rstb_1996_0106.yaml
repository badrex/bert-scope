tldr: The article discusses the importance of considering phylogenetic relationships
  when studying plant life histories and ecological traits. It presents two examples
  using the method of phylogenetically independent contrasts to test hypotheses about
  reproductive allocation and chemical defense in plants. The authors argue that incorporating
  phylogenetic information can provide more accurate insights into the causes of trait
  correlations and help to avoid pseudoreplication in comparative studies.
