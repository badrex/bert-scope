tldr: 'This study identifies and analyzes four distinct visible ingredients found
  in banded bituminous coal: fusain, vitrain, clarain, and durain. These ingredients
  can be separated and identified through macroscopic and microscopic examination,
  and their different reactions to chemical treatments indicate that they have different
  chemical compositions. The research provides a better understanding of the composition
  and structure of coal, which can be useful for the coal mining and energy industries.'
