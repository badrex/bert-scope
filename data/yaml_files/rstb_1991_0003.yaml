tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between tracheal
  mite parasitism and honey bee colony dynamics. They found that swarming, a natural
  behavior in honey bees, can reduce mite density within a colony. This discovery
  has implications for modern hive management techniques and may help explain the
  sudden appearance of tracheal mites in various regions.
