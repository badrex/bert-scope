tldr: This study investigates the efficiency of human work and the cost of associated
  movements. The authors found that efficiency is directly related to body weight,
  with heavier individuals having a higher efficiency in work performance. The study
  also highlights the importance of considering individual factors, such as clothing
  and body type, when examining efficiency in work and movement.
