tldr: The author describes a case study of a patient suffering from severe spasms
  in the thumb and forefinger. The spasms were traced to irritation in the median
  nerve, and the patient consented to have the nerve divided to stop the progress
  of the irritation. The operation was successful, and the patient eventually recovered,
  with the spasms no longer affecting the brain. This case study highlights the potential
  for surgical intervention in treating nerve-related disorders.
