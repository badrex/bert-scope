tldr: The authors investigate the photochemical law of the silver halide grain in
  photographic plates. They find that the probability of a grain being made developable
  depends on the light intensity and exposure time, and that the mechanism of the
  process is not the absorption of light in discrete quanta. The study helps to understand
  the development process and improve photographic techniques.
