tldr: This article provides an introduction to the complement system, a complex biochemical
  and genetic system that plays a crucial role in humoral immunity. The complement
  system has two pathways of activation, the classical and alternative pathways, which
  involve a series of proteolytic zymogens that convert to active proteases and form
  a lytic complex capable of lysing bacterial and animal cells. The article discusses
  the biochemistry, genetics, and medical importance of the complement system, including
  its connection to autoimmune diseases and the major histocompatibility complex.
