tldr: Fractal geometry is a new geometric language that deals with organized chaos
  and provides a middle ground between the excessive geometric order of Euclid and
  the geometric chaos of roughness and fragmentation. It is based on symmetries of
  invariance under dilations and contractions and is characterized by self-similarity.
  Fractals have diverse applications in art, pure mathematics, materials science,
  engineering, and physical theory.
