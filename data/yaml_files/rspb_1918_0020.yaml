tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the changes in electrical conductivity
  in plant roots under geotropic stimulation. They discovered that turning the root
  horizontal caused an immediate decrease in resistance, which was interpreted as
  an increase in permeability to ions. The authors developed a new apparatus to measure
  the resistance and tested it on the root-tip of Vicia Faba, providing insights into
  the mechanism of geotropic response in plants.
