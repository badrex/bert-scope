tldr: The authors study two novel self-exciting single-disk homopolar dynamos, one
  with a capacitor and the other with a motor in series with the coil. They analyze
  the behavior of these systems, including their sensitivity to initial conditions,
  and find that they can exhibit periodic and chaotic oscillations. The dynamos can
  be used as analogues in the study of phenomena in geophysical fluid dynamics, such
  as the Earth's main geomagnetic field and the El Niño-Southern Oscillation.
