tldr: The article discusses the role of exploratory mechanisms in the evolution of
  eukaryotic cellular processes. It highlights how dynamic instability of microtubules,
  neuronal growth, and immune system responses use variation and selection to generate
  specific patterns. These robust processes can adapt to changes in the environment
  and ontogenic changes in organisms, suggesting they have been selected for their
  ability to survive rapid changes and generate cellular variation.
