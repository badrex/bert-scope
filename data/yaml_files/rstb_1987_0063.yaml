tldr: This article discusses the advancements and future prospects of nitrogen fixation
  research. It explores various aspects of nitrogen-fixing symbiosis, including the
  efficiency of nitrogenase enzymes, the role of dicarboxylic acids in nodule formation,
  and the potential for alternative nitrogenase systems. The authors also debate the
  efficiency of different nitrogenase systems and the mechanisms behind nitrogen fixation.
