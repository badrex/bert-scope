tldr: The author examines the difference in mortality rates between towns and rural
  areas, finding that people in towns tend to have higher mortality rates due to factors
  like luxury, irregular lifestyles, and poor air quality. The author also discusses
  the impact of migration on these rates, suggesting that towns have a higher proportion
  of people in their prime years, while rural areas have more vulnerable populations,
  such as children and the elderly.
