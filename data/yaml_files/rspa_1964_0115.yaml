tldr: The article discusses the concept of anisotropic simple fluids, which are fluids
  whose stress tensor depends on the whole history of displacement gradients and rotation
  tensors. The author presents a constitutive equation for these fluids and explores
  their properties, including the effects of limited memory and incompressibility.
