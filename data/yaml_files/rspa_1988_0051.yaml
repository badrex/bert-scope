tldr: This article presents rigorous third-order and fourth-order bounds on the effective
  conductivity of a composite material composed of aligned, infinitely long, equisized,
  rigid, circular cylinders randomly distributed throughout a matrix. The authors
  simplify the key multidimensional integral using Chebyshev polynomials and calculate
  the microstructural parameter for an equilibrium distribution of cylinders. The
  results improve upon second-order bounds and provide good estimates of conductivity
  for various phase conductivities and volume fractions.
