revised_title: Overcoming the Divergence Difficulty in Quantized Field Theories
scientific_discipline: Physics > Quantum Mechanics
semantic_tags:

- Secular Perturbation Theory

- Interaction of Fields
tldr: The authors address the divergence difficulty in quantized field theories and
  propose a rigorous treatment of radiation reaction using secular perturbation theory.
  They explain the interaction of elementary particles through quantized fields and
  demonstrate how to calculate cross-sections for particle collisions, leading to
  a better understanding of the behavior of particles in these theories.
