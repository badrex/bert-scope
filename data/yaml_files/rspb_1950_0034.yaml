tldr: The author's experiments on tortoise muscles show that heat production begins
  before the mechanical response in muscular contraction. This finding supports the
  theory that chemical changes initiated by stimulation cause the mechanical response,
  rather than mechanical energy being released from a reservoir. The study provides
  a clearer understanding of the processes of contraction and relaxation in muscles
  and may lead to improvements in investigations limited by time constraints.
