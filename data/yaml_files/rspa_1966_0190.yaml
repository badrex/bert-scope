tldr: The authors studied the dispersion of a gaseous tracer in a flowing stream of
  another gas, with mass transfer to a retentive layer in a circular tube. They verified
  Aris's analysis by experimenting with a system that used a retentive layer of stagnant
  gas held within a porous solid structure. This research can be applied to gas chromatography
  and the study of gaseous diffusion in catalysts and other porous materials.
