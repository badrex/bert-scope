tldr: The author examines the unique macrocilia found in the ctenophore Beroe, which
  are thick, long cilia that line the lips of the ctenophore. These macrocilia beat
  in a coordinated manner and are specialized for the carnivorous feeding habits of
  Beroe. The author provides detailed descriptions of the structure and function of
  these macrocilia, as well as their role in the feeding behavior of the ctenophore.
