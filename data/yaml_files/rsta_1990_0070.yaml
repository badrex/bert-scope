tldr: This article discusses the current status and future prospects of fast breeder
  reactors in the USSR. Due to the Chernobyl disaster and growing public opposition
  to nuclear power, the large-scale deployment of fast breeder reactors has been postponed.
  However, the nuclear industry still faces increasing energy demands, and the article
  explores the experience gained through research and development and the operation
  of fast breeder reactors. It also examines the BN-350 and BN-600 reactors and their
  performance, as well as ongoing research in fast-reactor physics and nuclear safety.
