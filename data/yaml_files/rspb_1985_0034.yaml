tldr: The article studies the effects of selection for or against mitochondrial genomes
  that confer chloramphenicol resistance in a mouse cell line. The mutation occurs
  at a highly conserved position in the mitochondrial genome and confers an advantage
  to cells grown in the presence of chloramphenicol. The results show that selection
  at the cellular level plays a role in the evolution of the cell lines, and fixation
  takes many generations. This research may provide insights into the evolution of
  special mechanisms that favor the production of homoplasmic gametes in various organisms.
