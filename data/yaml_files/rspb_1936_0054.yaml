tldr: The authors conducted experiments with synthetic polycyclic compounds to study
  their oestrogenic activity. They found that some compounds in the series of diols
  related to 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene showed oestrogenic activity. The authors also
  examined a variety of diols of analogous structure and discussed the effect of molecular
  structure on oestrogenic activity. However, they were unable to determine the exact
  configuration of the compounds and its effect on oestrogenic activity.
