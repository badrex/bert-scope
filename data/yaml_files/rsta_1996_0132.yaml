revised_title: Continuous Elastic Phase Transitions in Pure and Disordered Crystals
scientific_discipline: Physics > Condensed Matter Physics
semantic_tags:
- Elastic phase transitions
- Acoustic phonons
- Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional
- Crystal anisotropy
- Disorder-induced phase transitions
tldr: The article discusses continuous elastic phase transitions in pure and disordered
  crystals, focusing on the softening of acoustic phonons and the role of anisotropy
  and disorder in these transitions. The Ginzburg-Landau free-energy functional is
  used to study the statics and dynamics of these phase transitions, and the effects
  of lattice defects are also considered.
