tldr: This paper presents an experimental study on the growth of waves on water due
  to wind action. The authors constructed models to investigate the behavior of water
  surfaces under wind pressure and measured the distribution of normal pressure on
  the surface of a wooden model of waves. The study aimed to provide experimental
  data for understanding the complex problem of wave formation by wind.
