tldr: This article presents new measurements of the attenuation of acoustic waves
  in quartz and develops a general theory for calculating the attenuation of acoustic
  waves in crystalline solids. The authors found that the attenuation is proportional
  to the square of the frequency, and they confirmed their analysis with results from
  attenuation measurements in quartz and silicon.
