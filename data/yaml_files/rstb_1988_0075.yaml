tldr: The article discusses the role of G-proteins in the inositol lipid signaling
  pathway, which generates inositol trisphosphate (InsP3) and diacylglycerol as second
  messengers. The author identifies two types of G-proteins, Gp and GE, that are involved
  in this signaling system and their connection to cellular secretion processes.
