tldr: The author, David Brewster, explains the origin and general phenomena of double
  refraction in regular crystals. He suggests that the property of double refraction
  is not inherent in the molecules themselves but results from their compression due
  to extraneous forces or inherent attraction of aggregation. The author also discusses
  the effects of heat and pressure on fluids and crystals, and how these forces influence
  their optical properties.
