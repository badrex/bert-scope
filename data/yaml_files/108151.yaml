tldr: The author conducted extensive dissections and research on the nervous system
  of the human uterus, particularly during pregnancy. They discovered four major plexuses
  and several ganglia that form the uterus' nervous system, which play a crucial role
  in its functions. The study also refutes previous misconceptions about the role
  of nerves in the uterus during pregnancy.
