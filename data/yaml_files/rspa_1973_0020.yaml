tldr: The authors present a study of the atomic field equations in electromagnetism
  within the framework of quantum electrodynamics. They derive the quantum mechanical
  electric polarization and magnetization fields and obtain the quantal atomic field
  equations. The study focuses on the microscopic displacement vector and the microscopic
  auxiliary field, and their relation to the electric and magnetic fields, without
  reference to multipolar expansions.
