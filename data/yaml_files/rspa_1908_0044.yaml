tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the trajectories of rifled projectiles
  with different head shapes and sizes. They found that the shape of the projectile
  head significantly affects the trajectory, and developed a formula to calculate
  the necessary angle of elevation for various projectile shapes. The study also showed
  that the effectiveness of pointed projectiles decreases with increased air resistance.
