tldr: The study investigates the accumulation of lactic acid in muscles during freezing
  and finds that it occurs due to the removal of free water from the muscle to form
  ice. The rate of lactic acid accumulation is determined by the storage temperature,
  and it is not caused by oxygen deficiency. The research also discovers that the
  concentration of inorganic ions in the muscle plasma plays a significant role in
  the formation of lactic acid.
