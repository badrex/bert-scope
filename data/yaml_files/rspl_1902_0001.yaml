tldr: The author conducted a comparative study of the spectra, densities, and melting
  points of various groups of elements to investigate the relationship between their
  properties and atomic mass. They found that the spectra of metals in each group
  are similar to one another and differ from those of other groups, with the positions
  of lines changing systematically with increasing atomic mass. This study aimed to
  discover the laws governing the distribution of lines in spectra and the relations
  between the physical and chemical properties of metals and their spectra.
