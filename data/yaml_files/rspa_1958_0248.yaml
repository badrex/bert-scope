tldr: This study investigates the friction of metals at very high speeds, both on
  themselves and on diamond surfaces. The authors found that the sliding resistance
  of metals decreases as the speed increases, reaching very low values. They suggest
  that frictional heating causes high surface temperatures and a softening or melting
  of the metal at the contact points. The results show that metals with a high melting
  point are most effective in polishing diamond surfaces, and that the wear of diamond
  is due to an allotropic transformation into graphite or amorphous carbon under the
  influence of localized frictional heating.
