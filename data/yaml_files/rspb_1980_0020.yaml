tldr: The authors present a theory of edge detection in images, using a combination
  of filters and the second derivative of a Gaussian distribution to detect intensity
  changes at different scales. This method creates a raw primal sketch, which is a
  primitive description of the image, and helps in understanding the goals of early
  image analysis in vision. The theory explains several psychophysical findings and
  provides a basis for a physiological model of simple cells in the visual cortex.
