tldr: The author, H. C. Sorby, discovered that the unusual spectra of compounds of
  zirconia and uranium oxides were not due to a new elementary substance, but rather
  the result of a powerful interaction between the two elements. This interaction
  causes an almost inappreciable amount of the compounds to produce highly distinct
  spectra. The author also found that the presence of other elements, such as erbium,
  didymium, and yttria, in zircons can modify their physical and optical properties.
