tldr: The authors conducted scattering experiments to study the interaction between
  neutrons and protons. They tested different forms of the interaction, such as spherical,
  Gauss, inverse fifth power, and exponential fields, and found that the ratio of
  binding energies for parallel and antiparallel spins is nearly the same for all
  fields. The results provide insights into the nature of the neutron-proton interaction
  and help to understand the binding energies of atomic nuclei.
