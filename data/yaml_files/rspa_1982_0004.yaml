tldr: The authors discuss exponential transformation models, a type of parametric
  models in mathematical statistics. They show that these models possess an explicit
  exponential representation in terms of a -dimensional, real affine representation
  of the group generating the model. The models have important properties and can
  be extended to larger (composite) exponential transformation models for various
  purposes, such as model control. The inference for these models is described in
  general terms, and examples of such models are discussed.
