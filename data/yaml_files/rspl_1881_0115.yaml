tldr: The author examines the minute anatomy, histology, and development of the thymus
  gland in various animals. They describe the structure and function of the thymus,
  its role in the immune system, and the process of involution. The study provides
  insights into the differences in thymus anatomy among different species and the
  role of granular cells, giant cells, and concentric corpuscles in the thymus's development
  and function.
