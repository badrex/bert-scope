tldr: The author, George Witchell, investigates the nature of the curve formed by
  the shadow of a prolate spheroid, such as a planet like Jupiter, on a plane. He
  explores the irregularities in the duration of eclipses of Jupiter's satellites
  due to the figure of its body, which is not truly spherical but a prolate spheroid.
  Witchell's study helps in understanding the inclination of planes and the angle
  between right lines in a spherical triangle, which is essential for celestial mechanics
  and astronomy.
