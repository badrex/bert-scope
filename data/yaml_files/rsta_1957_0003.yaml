tldr: The authors present a mathematical model for studying flames, focusing on the
  equations and boundary conditions required to describe the behavior of reacting
  gas mixtures. They introduce a one-dimensional flame model and discuss the assumptions
  and methods used to solve the complex flame equations. The study provides insights
  into the structure and behavior of flames, with implications for understanding and
  controlling combustion processes.
