tldr: The author, David Nicolson, investigates whether the Scurvy-grass of Greenland
  has the same properties as the one in England. He observes that the plant's volatile
  salt changes its nature as it approaches the sun, becoming less pungent in the warmer
  climate of Greenland. Nicolson also notes the remarkable change in the plant's properties
  when exposed to the sun's heat in London, suggesting that the saline matter in Greenland
  becomes more volatile over time.
