tldr: Sir William Crookes investigates the possibility of creating diamonds under
  extreme pressure and temperature conditions using closed-vessel explosions. He successfully
  synthesizes diamonds from residues of cordite explosions and confirms their identity
  through crystallographic analysis. This discovery opens up a new method for artificially
  producing diamonds.
