tldr: The author investigated the effect of chlorine on the electromotive force of
  a voltaic couple. They discovered that adding a certain amount of chlorine to the
  distilled water had a significant impact on the electromotive force. The experiment
  demonstrated the sensitivity of the method and the potential for further research
  on the interaction between electrolytes and dissolved substances.
