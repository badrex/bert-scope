tldr: This article presents a case study of a woman with a large steatomatous tumour
  in her abdomen. Despite the initial belief that it might be an extra-uterine fetus,
  it was later discovered to be a tumour under the peritoneum. The woman eventually
  passed away, and upon autopsy, the tumour was found to be a distension of the omentum,
  adhering to various organs. This case study provides valuable insights into the
  complexities of diagnosing and treating abdominal tumours.
