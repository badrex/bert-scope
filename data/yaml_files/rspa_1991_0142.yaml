tldr: The authors present a new derivation of the multiple scattering perturbation
  theory for electron densities, which allows for a more generalized and practical
  application compared to previous derivations. The new derivation demonstrates that
  the electron density should be independent of the energy origin chosen for calculations,
  enabling the use of various physical models and providing explicit formulae for
  corrections to the Thomas-Fermi theory.
