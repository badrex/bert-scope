tldr: This study investigates the effects of certain aromatic compounds on the nervous
  system. The authors found that these compounds primarily affect motor centers, causing
  tremors, convulsions, and paralysis. Benzene and its derivatives, such as chlorobenzene,
  bromobenzene, and iodobenzene, have similar effects on frogs, with the halogen radicals
  not significantly altering the benzene's action. The addition of hydroxyl to the
  benzene nucleus intensifies the convulsant action, with oxybenzene (carbolic acid)
  and dioxybenzene causing convulsions in frogs, and trioxybenzene causing milder
  jerkings.
