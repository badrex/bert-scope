tldr: This study investigates the formation and properties of rigid surface films
  at the interface between metals and liquids. The researchers developed a mechanical
  squeeze film apparatus to measure the thickness of the lubricant film and observed
  its behavior under various conditions. They discovered that the film thickness is
  influenced by temperature and that the films are organized by chemical forces rather
  than physical forces. The findings provide insights into boundary lubrication and
  related phenomena.
