tldr: This article explores the quantum theory of the diplon, which is a simple nuclear
  system consisting of a proton and a neutron. The authors investigate the forces
  acting between these particles and their interaction, leading to the understanding
  of nuclear mechanics. They also discuss the absorption and capture of neutrons by
  protons, as well as the scattering of slow neutrons, providing insights into nuclear
  physics and potential applications.
