tldr: The authors introduce a new method called 'virtual reality box' using a mirror
  to induce movement sensations in phantom limbs. They found that six out of ten patients
  experienced kinesthetic sensations in their phantom limbs when their normal hand
  moved, causing the phantom to appear to move in the mirror. This technique also
  helped relieve pain and spasms in some patients, suggesting that there is a significant
  amount of latent plasticity in the adult human brain.
