tldr: The article discusses three iterative procedures related to relaxation methods
  for solving eigenvalue problems in systems with a finite number of degrees of freedom.
  The procedures exhibit quadratic, geometric, and cubic convergence, and they are
  shown to be within the framework of the relaxation method. The study investigates
  the convergence and behavior of the relaxation method and provides guiding principles
  for the relaxation computer.
