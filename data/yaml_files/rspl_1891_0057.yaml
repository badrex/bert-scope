tldr: This study investigates the origin of sympathetic fibers in the spinal cord
  and their effects on various bodily functions. The author found that sympathetic
  fibers in cats, dogs, and rabbits arise from different thoracic nerves and have
  varying effects on the pupil, nictitating membrane, vaso-motor activity, and sub-maxillary
  gland secretion. The study also discusses the presence of white and grey rami communicantes
  and their relation to efferent and afferent fibers in the spinal cord.
