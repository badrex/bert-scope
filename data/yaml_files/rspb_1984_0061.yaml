tldr: The study investigates auditory responses in the torus semicircularis of the
  cane toad, focusing on field potential studies. The research examines how the amplitude
  of field potentials varies with the frequency of the stimulus and the location of
  the electrode along the rostro-caudal axis of the torus. The results suggest that
  binaural neural integration plays a significant role in determining the directional
  sensitivity of field potentials evoked by low to mid frequencies, but not for potentials
  evoked by mid to high frequencies.
