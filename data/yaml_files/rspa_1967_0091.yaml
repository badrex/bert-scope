tldr: The authors studied the optical absorption and reflection spectra of thin molybdenum
  disulphide crystals to understand how exciton absorption bands change in appearance
  and behavior as the crystal thickness decreases. They found that exciton bands move
  to higher energies in thin crystals due to increased exciton binding energy in small
  crystal volumes. This effect is more pronounced for excitons with larger radii.
  The authors also measured the variation of absorption coefficient and refractive
  index over the exciton spectra and observed oscillations in transmission with changing
  crystal thickness at the peaks of the exciton bands.
