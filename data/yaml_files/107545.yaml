tldr: The author, John F. W. Herschel, examines the interaction of crystallized bodies,
  such as apophyllite, with homogeneous light. He discovers that the deviation from
  Newton's scale of colors is due to the secondary cause, which affects the lengths
  of the minimum oscillations of differently colored rays within the medium. This
  study helps to understand the properties of crystals and their effects on light.
