tldr: The author presents a new modification of the dynamo-magneto-electric machine
  that simplifies the design and maximizes effective power. The machine uses an electromagnet
  with shoes and a Siemens's armature that revolves in a groove. The innovation lies
  in the break or commutator, which employs two springs or rubbers to take the current
  off from the commutator, allowing for the utilization of alternate currents in the
  same direction. This design is applicable to machines with multiple armatures, offering
  economic advantages and the ability to vary the power of the machine.
