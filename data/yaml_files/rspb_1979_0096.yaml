tldr: The study investigates the influence of experimentally induced agranularity
  on the synaptogenesis of serotonin nerve terminals in rat cerebellar cortex. The
  serotonin innervation undergoes significant changes in the absence of granule cells,
  with terminals forming more synaptic connections. This suggests that the cerebellar
  environment plays a crucial role in the formation of cerebellar connectivity.
