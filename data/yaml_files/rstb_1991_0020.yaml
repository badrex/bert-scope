tldr: This article explores the molecular approaches to nerve regeneration, focusing
  on the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) and its receptor. The authors study the
  mechanism of action of NGF and identify novel gene sequences regulated during regeneration.
  They also analyze the structure and function of the NGF receptor, providing insights
  into its binding domain and the role of cysteine-rich sequences in NGF binding.
