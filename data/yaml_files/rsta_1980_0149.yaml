tldr: This article presents experimental and computational evidence for the coexistence
  of multiple-chain silicates within an amphibole host in nephrite. The authors used
  various techniques, including electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction, to analyze
  the internal structure of nephrite and understand the relationship between different
  types of silicates and their host structure.
