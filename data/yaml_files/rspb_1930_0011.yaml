tldr: The author, Redcliffe N. Salaman, and his team discovered a new disease affecting
  potatoes called Para-Crinkle, which is distinct from the previously known Crinkle
  disease. They studied the symptoms, transmission, and reactions of different potato
  varieties to this new disease through grafting and virus transmission. The research
  aimed to better understand and classify potato diseases for agricultural purposes.
