tldr: The authors discovered a new method to synthesize carbon monosulphide by reacting
  thiophosgene with nickel carbonyl. They found that the product is a brown powder
  with unique properties, such as being insoluble in most solvents and having a specific
  gravity of around 1.6. The molecular volume of carbon monosulphide is about 10%
  greater than the sum of the atomic volumes of its constituents, indicating a condensed
  molecule.
