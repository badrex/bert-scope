tldr: This study examines the color physiology of higher crustaceans, specifically
  the chromatophores in Hippolyte and Crangon. The research explores the role of light
  in the formation and accumulation of pigments and colorless chromatophoric fat,
  which serves as a reserve food material. The authors also discuss how crustaceans
  change color in response to their environment's light conditions.
