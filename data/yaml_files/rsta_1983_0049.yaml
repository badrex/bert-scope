tldr: This article discusses the importance of measuring global sea-surface temperature
  from space with high accuracy for climate research. It reviews current satellite
  measurements of sea-surface temperature using infrared and microwave techniques
  and describes the future sea-surface temperature-measuring instrument, the Along-Track
  Scanning Radiometer (ATSR). The article highlights the need for accurate empirical
  determinations based on direct measurements to establish a better understanding
  of the Earth's climate.
