tldr: In a letter to the Rev. Samuel Squire, Rev. Thomas Rutherforth describes the
  extraordinary agitation of waters in several ponds in Hertfordshire. He recounts
  the unusual motion observed in ponds at Patmerhall, Wickham-hall, Thaxted, and Royston,
  with details on the direction and extent of the water movement. This phenomenon
  remained unexplained at the time of the letter.
