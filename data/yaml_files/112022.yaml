tldr: The author investigates the absorption and transmission of radiant heat by different
  liquids and their vapors. They find that the state of aggregation has a minor impact
  on the absorption of radiant heat, and the position of a liquid determines the position
  of its vapor. Water is found to be the most effective absorber and radiator among
  the substances tested. The author also explores the relationship between the chemical
  constitution of radiant and absorbent substances and their absorption and radiation
  properties.
