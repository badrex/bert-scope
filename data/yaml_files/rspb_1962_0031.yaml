tldr: The authors conducted experiments on HeLa cells to examine the relationship
  between nuclear and cytoplasmic ribonucleic acid (RNA). They found that the labelled
  nuclear RNA was not transferred to the cytoplasm in a stable form but was rapidly
  broken down within the cell. This study suggests that at least some nuclear RNA
  is labile in many animal and plant cells.
