tldr: The authors investigated the fine-structure of some lines in the visible region
  of the spectrum of thallium III. They used a specialized optical system to analyze
  the light and found that the nuclear moment of the thallium atom played a significant
  role in the structure of the lines. The study provided valuable insights into the
  behavior of the thallium atom and its spectrum.
