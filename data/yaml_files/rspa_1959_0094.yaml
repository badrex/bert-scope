tldr: The authors demonstrate a new approach to represent the static and kinematic
  principles of plastic collapse for frames using dual linear programming problems.
  They develop a new parametric form for the static equations of equilibrium and show
  that the static and kinematic principles are dual to each other. This approach provides
  a foundation for further research in plastic limit design and optimization of structures.
