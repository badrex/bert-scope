tldr: The author, William Crookes, conducted experiments with rarefied gases and the
  induction current. He discovered a constant dark space surrounding the negative
  pole, which he called the "molecular disturbance." This phenomenon increased in
  thickness as the gas was rarefied. Crookes also observed similar effects with different
  gases and heating the metal pole. His findings suggest that the molecular disturbance
  is related to the concept of molecular pressure or stress.
