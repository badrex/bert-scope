tldr: In February 1756, the authors observed and documented irregularities in the
  tides at Chatham, Sheerness, Woolwich, and Deptford. They attributed these irregularities
  to strong winds and gales during that week, which affected the tidal patterns and
  water levels. The authors also provided detailed accounts of their observations
  and the impact of wind direction on tidal phenomena.
