tldr: This article discusses the role of major impact processes in the evolution of
  the lunar crust, using terrestrial impact craters as analogues for understanding
  lunar structures and estimating the depth of lunar crust disturbance. The study
  of impact craters on Earth, Mars, and Mercury helps in understanding the formation
  and evolution of the Moon's surface.
