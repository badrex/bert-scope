tldr: The study investigates the dynamics of cytoplasmic membranes in pancreatic acinar
  cells, focusing on the composition, synthesis, and turnover of the membranes involved
  in the intracellular transport of secretory proteins. The research reveals distinct
  differences in chemical composition and enzyme activities of the membranes, and
  that their turnover rate is slower than that of secretory proteins. These findings
  suggest that the intracellular transport is affected through the specific interaction,
  fusion, and recycling of the various participating membranes.
