tldr: The author presents a statistical method for evaluating and adjusting outlier
  observations in data. The method takes into account the probability of abnormal
  errors and uses inverse probability to determine the most probable values. This
  method is demonstrated using seismological observations, but it has wider applications
  in various fields.
