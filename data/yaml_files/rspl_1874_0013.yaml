tldr: The author conducted experiments to compare the paramagnetic condition of arterial
  blood and the diamagnetic condition of venous blood. They used an electromagnet
  and a special apparatus to test the magnetic properties of blood samples. The results
  showed that arterial blood, rich in oxygen, exhibited paramagnetic properties, while
  venous blood, containing more carbon dioxide, displayed diamagnetic properties.
  This research helped to understand the differences in blood properties and their
  relation to oxygenation.
