tldr: The author investigates the persistence and characteristics of luminosity in
  electric discharges in various gases and vapors. They observe that the luminosity
  can persist after the current has ceased and study the duration and intensity of
  the afterglow in different conditions. The author also examines the spectra of the
  luminosity and finds that the metallic glows have distinct line spectra, which can
  help in understanding the underlying mechanisms of the luminosity.
