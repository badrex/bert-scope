tldr: In 1764, a British expedition led by Commodore Byron encountered a tribe of
  very tall people near the Strait of Magellan. The Patagonians were described as
  having a copper-like skin, long black hair, and standing up to nine feet tall. The
  encounter provided valuable insights into the appearance and lifestyle of these
  indigenous people, but also highlighted the cultural differences and communication
  barriers between the two groups.
