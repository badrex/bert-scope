tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of amacrine cells in the rat retina using
  the Golgi staining method. They identified nine morphologically distinct types of
  amacrine cells, including wide-field diffuse, unistratified, bistratified, and stratified
  diffuse cells. They also found six types of displaced amacrine cells in the ganglion
  cell layer. The study provides insights into the diverse types of amacrine cells
  and their distribution in the rat retina, which may have implications for understanding
  retinal function and visual processing.
