tldr: This article discusses the experiments conducted by James D. Forbes to study
  the transparency of the atmosphere and the law of extinction of solar rays as they
  pass through it. Forbes explores the historical context of the subject and the methods
  used by previous researchers like Bouguer and Lambert. He also explains the challenges
  in measuring light and heat and the importance of understanding the atmosphere for
  resolving various astronomical problems.
