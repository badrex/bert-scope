tldr: The author presents spectroscopic evidence supporting the hypothesis that comets
  are meteoric swarms in the solar system. They discuss the similarities between the
  spectra of comets and gradually condensing meteoric swarms outside the system, as
  well as the spectroscopic evidence obtained from experiments with meteoric dust.
  The author also examines the spectra of aurorae and the origin of double stars,
  further supporting their hypothesis.
