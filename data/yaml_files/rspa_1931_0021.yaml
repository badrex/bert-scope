tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of hard gamma rays
  and the role of nuclear absorption. They used a steel ionization chamber with high
  pressure to measure the weak radiations produced by scattered gamma rays. The results
  showed that not more than a third of the difference in absorption coefficients of
  thorium-rays in heavy and light elements can be attributed to nuclear absorption
  resulting in the re-emission of approximately isotropic radiation.
