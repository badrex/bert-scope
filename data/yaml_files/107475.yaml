tldr: The author, Andrew Ure, conducted experiments on the relationship between temperature,
  elasticity, and latent heat of different vapours. He developed a simple apparatus
  to measure the elastic forces of vapours at various temperatures, contributing to
  the understanding of thermodynamics and caloric.
