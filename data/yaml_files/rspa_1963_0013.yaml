tldr: The authors studied the impact of oxygen on the thermoluminescence of irradiated
  polyethylene. They discovered that oxygen significantly affects the glow curve,
  altering the peaks and adding a new peak at a lower temperature. The oxygen effect
  can be removed by pumping or a pre-irradiation followed by pre-heating, which converts
  oxygen to peroxide radicals. The thermoluminescence phenomena in polyethylene can
  be explained by a model involving the trapping of electrons followed by their recombination
  with different types of luminescence centers.
