tldr: This article investigates the scattering theory of how glare affects the brightness
  difference threshold in foveal vision. The authors criticize Holladay's previous
  work and present a revised scattering theory that addresses its shortcomings. They
  find that the observed increase in the threshold due to glare is not primarily caused
  by light scattering in the eye media, but rather by other factors.
