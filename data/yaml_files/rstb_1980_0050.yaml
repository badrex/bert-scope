tldr: The authors studied the active sites of two extracellular β-lactamases produced
  by Bacillus cereus. They discovered that one enzyme, β-lactamase I, is inactivated
  by 6-β-bromopenicillanic acid, with serine-44 being the site of reaction. This serine
  residue is conserved in other β-lactamases and is considered a good candidate for
  an active site group in these enzymes. The other enzyme, β-lactamase II, requires
  metal ions for activity, with three histidine residues and the enzyme's sole thiol
  group binding the metal ion needed for activity.
