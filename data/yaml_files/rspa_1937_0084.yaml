tldr: The authors explore the similarity theory of turbulence and its application
  to flow between parallel planes and through pipes. They discuss the assumptions
  of the theory, its consequences, and the velocity distribution in pressure flow.
  The study provides a deeper understanding of turbulence and its impact on fluid
  dynamics in pipes and channels.
