tldr: The author, David Brewster, conducted experiments on the polarization and depolarization
  of light transmitted through crystallized bodies, such as agate, mica, topaz, and
  rock crystal. He discovered that these substances have unique properties that affect
  the polarization of light, and he observed new phenomena like elliptical colored
  rings produced by oblique depolarizing crystals. Brewster also found that certain
  angles, now known as Brewster's angle, cause light to be refracted without being
  polarized.
