  Nitromethane and Cyclohexane + Acetic Anhydride'

tldr: The authors examine the coexistence curves of two binary liquid systems, carbon
  disulphide + nitromethane and cyclohexane + acetic anhydride, and find evidence
  of a diameter singularity. They develop a scaling theory for critical phenomena
  in binary liquid systems, incorporating the diameter singularity, and discuss its
  implications and potential future experiments.
