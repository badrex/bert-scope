tldr: The authors measured the photoelectron spectra of molecules containing the C≡N
  group, focusing on cyanogen halides. They determined ionization potentials and assigned
  them to specific molecular orbitals. The study showed that the delocalization of
  halogen electrons in the molecular orbitals decreases along the series from chloride
  to iodide, and the degree of delocalization affects the splitting of levels due
  to spin-orbit coupling.
