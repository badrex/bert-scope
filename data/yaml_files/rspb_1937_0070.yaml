tldr: The author conducted experiments on ovariectomized golden hamsters, injecting
  them with crystalline ovarian hormones. They found that while oestrogen alone, progesterone
  alone, or progesterone following oestrogen did not cause vaginal mucification, progesterone
  together with oestrogen produced high columnar cells filled with mucus, similar
  to the mucification observed during pregnancy. This suggests that full mucification
  in the golden hamster is due to the simultaneous action of balanced amounts of oestrogen
  and progesterone.
