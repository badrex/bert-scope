tldr: The authors developed a mathematical model to study the viscoelastic behavior
  of the lithosphere and asthenosphere during cyclic displacements on the San Andreas
  Fault. They found that the interaction between the elastic lithosphere and the viscoelastic
  asthenosphere damps out the time-dependence at large distances from the fault, with
  the relaxation process characterized by a time scale and a Newtonian viscosity.
  This model helps to understand the time dependence of strain as a function of distance
  from the San Andreas Fault.
