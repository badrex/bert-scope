tldr: This article studies the local and global bifurcations of two-parameter families
  of planar maps with constant Jacobian determinant. The authors focus on the creation
  of horseshoes, a type of chaotic behavior, and explore the relation between bifurcation
  sets and invariant sets of one- and two-dimensional maps. They use the orientation-preserving
  Hénon map as their main example and discuss the differences in bifurcation sequences
  between one- and two-dimensional maps.
