tldr: The author conducted extensive observations on their own body temperature using
  a specialized thermometer. They discovered that the temperature of a healthy human
  body can vary depending on factors such as time of day, exercise, and environmental
  conditions. The study found that body temperature is generally highest after waking
  up, decreases throughout the day, and reaches its lowest point at night. Active
  exercise was also found to increase body temperature, while passive exercise had
  little effect.
