tldr: The author investigates the lift and moment on a flat plate in a stream of finite
  width, using a method of conformal transformation. The study considers an elliptic
  cylinder and its boundary conditions, providing expansions for lift and moment suitable
  for any position of the plate. The findings can be applied to understand the forces
  acting on a flat plate in various fluid dynamics scenarios.
