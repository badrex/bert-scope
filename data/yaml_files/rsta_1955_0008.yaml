tldr: The authors developed a high-precision aneroid calorimeter for measuring heats
  of combustion, specifically focusing on the heat of combustion of succinic acid.
  The calorimeter eliminates several sources of error found in water calorimeters,
  and the authors found that the heat of combustion of succinic acid agrees well with
  previous high-precision measurements. The aneroid calorimeter offers a more accurate
  and precise method for measuring heats of combustion, making it a suitable tool
  for chemical applications and research.
