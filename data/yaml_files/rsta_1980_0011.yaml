tldr: The authors analyze the results of deep drilling at Site 398 in the Galicia
  Bank area, providing insights into the evolution of passive continental margins
  in the North Atlantic Ocean. They discuss the lithologic and stratigraphic evidence
  from the drilling site and regional seismic reflection data, placing it in the context
  of the early tectonic evolution of the North Atlantic Ocean. The study reveals the
  morphology of the western Iberian continental margin and the initial creation of
  the interior basin filled with pre-Neocomian sediments, related to the Permo-Triassic-Liassic
  and/or late Jurassic to early Cretaceous distensive episodes.
