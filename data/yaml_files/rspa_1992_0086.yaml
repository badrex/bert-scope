tldr: The authors introduce a method for constructing solutions of homogeneous partial
  differential equations, focusing on localized wave solutions. They apply this method
  to the wave equation, Laplace's equation, the wave equation in a lossy infinite
  medium, and the Klein-Gordon equation. The localized wave solutions exhibit a degree
  of focusing about the propagation axis and have potential applications in various
  fields.
