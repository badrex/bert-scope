tldr: The authors conducted experiments injecting sugar into a dog's vein to study
  the chemical changes it undergoes in the body. They discovered that large amounts
  of sugar can cause nerve symptoms, including convulsions and coma, and that sugar
  is not eliminated through the kidneys in the form of sugar. The study also found
  that small amounts of sugar were present in the vomit and saliva, and that sugar
  metabolism does not involve significant glycogen formation.
