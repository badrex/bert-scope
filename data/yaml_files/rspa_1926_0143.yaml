tldr: The authors, J.D. Bernal and Sir William Bragg, describe the rotation method
  for analyzing crystal structures using X-ray diffraction. They explain the concept
  of the reciprocal lattice and its applications in understanding crystal diffraction
  patterns. The rotation method is particularly useful for determining the size and
  shape of the unit cell and identifying the space group of a crystal. The authors
  also discuss the limitations and potential improvements of the method.
