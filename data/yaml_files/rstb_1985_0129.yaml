tldr: This study investigates the composition, abundance, and distribution of zooplankton
  in the western Irish Sea from April 1980 to November 1981. The research found that
  Pseudocalanus elongatus and Acartia clausi were the most abundant species, while
  Calanus finmarchicus contributed the most to the total zooplankton biomass. The
  highest zooplankton standing stocks were found above the thermocline in the stratified
  region between April and June, and the frontal region had little influence on the
  distribution of zooplankton.
