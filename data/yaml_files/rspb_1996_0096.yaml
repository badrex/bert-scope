tldr: The author examines the role of competition and expansion in the evolution of
  tetrapods, finding that competitive replacement has likely played a minor role.
  Most tetrapod families arose by expanding into the ecospace and geographic areas
  previously occupied by other members of the Tetrapoda. The study analyzed 840 non-singleton
  families of tetrapods, assessing their overlaps in time, space, and ecology to understand
  the prevalence of competition.
