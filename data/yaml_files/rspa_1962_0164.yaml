tldr: The authors apply the two-beam dynamical theory of electron diffraction to explain
  features of bend and thickness extinction contours and images of stacking faults
  observed in transmission electron micrographs of metal foils. They describe anomalous
  transmission effects due to inelastic scattering processes and introduce a complex
  lattice potential to account for absorption. The theory allows for the estimation
  of absorption parameters, but further investigation is needed to understand the
  mechanisms of inelastic electron scattering.
