tldr: The authors explore periodic forests with the largest clearings of size 3, providing
  a method of enumeration and examining the various possibilities. They find that
  there are 12 distinct periodic forests with the largest clearings of size 3 and
  sketch their corresponding tessellations. This study contributes to the understanding
  of periodic forests and their patterns.
