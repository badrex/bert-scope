tldr: The author, Earl of Rosse, shares his observations and sketches of various nebulae
  and star clusters using a three-foot aperture telescope. He discusses the challenges
  of observing these celestial objects and the importance of accurate micrometrical
  measurements. The observations confirm Sir John Herschel's classification of resolvable
  nebulae and provide insights into the nature of these astronomical phenomena.
