tldr: Edward Wright discovered a large Orthoceratites fossil in a marble table in
  Ghent. The fossil measures two feet four inches and 7-10ths in length and has sixty-six
  distinct partitions. The Orthoceratites is a rare and intriguing fossil, resembling
  the concamerated partitions of nautili but never found in its recent state. The
  fossil's discovery and description provide valuable insights into the study of paleontology
  and natural history.
