tldr: This study investigates the expression of cholinergic properties in rat Schwann
  cells in isolation and in co-culture with primary fat myotube cultures. The results
  show that the level of choline-acetyltransferase in co-cultures increases after
  three weeks, suggesting that cholinergic properties are induced in Schwann cells.
  The findings support the hypothesis of a positive signal that triggers the expression
  of cholinergic function in glial cells.
