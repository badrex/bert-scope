tldr: The authors used the crossed-beam method to measure the ionization cross-section
  of neon in a reaction. The cross-section increased linearly with electron energy
  and reached a maximum value of 3 at 200 eV. A semi-empirical formula proposed by
  Drawin described the measured cross-section within the experimental error limits
  when the two adjustable parameters took the values of 0.5 and 1.
