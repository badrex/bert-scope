tldr: 'The author, Edward Pigott, presents a catalog of variable stars observed and
  classified into two divisions: undoubtedly changeable and those remaining to be

  these stars, discussing their periods, brightness changes, and classifications.
  This work contributes to the understanding of variable stars and their behavior,
  which is essential for astronomers and researchers in the field.'
