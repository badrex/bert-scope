tldr: The author discusses the debate between the ancient belief that lungs cool and
  condense blood and the modern system of Dr. Pitcairn, who believed that lungs mix,
  attenuate, and expand blood. The author presents observations and calculations on
  various hearts to argue that blood is both cooled and mixed during the process of
  respiration, and that the lungs play a crucial role in the body's circulation and
  oxygenation.
