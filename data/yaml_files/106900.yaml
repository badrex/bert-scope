tldr: The author, David Hosack, discusses the mechanism of vision and the role of
  the eye muscles in focusing on objects at different distances. He challenges the
  idea that the iris and the crystalline lens are solely responsible for this ability
  and suggests that the external muscles of the eye may also play a role. The author
  also examines the structure of the crystalline lens and its layers, questioning
  the existence of muscles within the lens.
