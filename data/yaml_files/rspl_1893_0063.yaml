tldr: The author presents further observations on the shoulder girdle and clavicular
  arch in Ichthyosauria and Sauropterygia, discussing the nature of bones and their
  relative positions. The author argues against previous interpretations and suggests
  the presence of a precoracoid element in these extinct animals, which is crucial
  for understanding their skeletal anatomy and evolution.
