tldr: The authors conducted a chemical and bacteriological examination of sewage to
  determine the species of organisms present and their chemical characteristics. They
  isolated various organisms and studied their reactions to oxygen, finding that some
  were aerobic and others anaerobic. The research aimed to understand the processes
  of purification and putrefaction in sewage and the role of different organisms in
  these changes.
