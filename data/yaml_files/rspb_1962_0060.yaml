tldr: The authors conducted a study on the occurrence of macroglobulin antibodies
  in maternal and foetal rabbit sera using gradient centrifugation. They discovered
  that a macroglobulin component is present in foetal rabbit sera, increasing with
  foetal age. The study confirmed that agglutinins in both heavy and light components
  of immune rabbit sera are transmitted from mother to foetus, and that molecular
  size does not play a significant role in the transmission of active immunity before
  birth in rabbits.
