tldr: The study investigates the impact of fasting on the transmission of Hyoscyamus
  virus 3 by the aphid Myzus persicae. The research found that fasting aphids before
  feeding on infected plants significantly increased their infectivity. The findings
  suggest that the transmission of the virus is not solely a mechanical process and
  that the aphid plays a role in the virus's behavior.
