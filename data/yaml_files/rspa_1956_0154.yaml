tldr: The article discusses the paramagnetic resonance spectra of iron group fluorides
  and the fluorine hyperfine structure present in their lattices. The authors analyze
  the magnetic properties and charge transfer in dilute samples of Mn, Fe, and Co,
  providing insights into the crystal field theory and the interactions between magnetic
  electrons and surrounding fluorine nuclei.
