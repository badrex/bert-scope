tldr: This article discusses the structure, activity, and evolution of the enzymes
  involved in glycolysis, focusing on phosphorylase. The author describes the crystal
  structures of phosphorylase and its interaction with various substrates and inhibitors.
  The article also explores the mechanisms of catalysis and enzyme regulation, including
  the role of phosphorylation and allosteric effectors in controlling phosphorylase
  activity.
