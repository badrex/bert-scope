tldr: The author conducted experiments on various animals to study the factors influencing
  cutaneous absorption, particularly focusing on the absorption of atropine. They
  discovered that factors such as age, the use of chloroform as a solvent, and the
  presence of innervation can significantly affect the absorption rate. The author
  also found that the albino rat is a suitable animal model for studying cutaneous
  absorption due to its ease of measurement and low susceptibility to errors.
