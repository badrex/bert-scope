tldr: This article discusses the recent advancements in the understanding of dynamical
  chaos in Hamiltonian systems. It explores the properties of mixed systems, which
  exhibit both regular and chaotic motion, and contrasts them with integrable and
  Anosov systems. The article also covers the K.A.M. theorem, perturbation expansions,
  and the role of chaos in various applications, such as particle accelerators, storage
  rings, and statistical mechanics.
