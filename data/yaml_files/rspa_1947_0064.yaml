tldr: The authors investigate the effect of deviations of atoms from ideal lattice
  sites in dilute solid solutions on X-ray reflexions. They propose a method to describe
  these deviations and analyze the changes in lattice constants. The study focuses
  on solid solutions of Au-Cu and shows that the distortion effect can be detected
  experimentally, while the thermal effect is secondary and cannot mask the distortion
  effect.
