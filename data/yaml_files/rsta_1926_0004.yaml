tldr: This article investigates the modification of diffraction patterns in optical
  systems due to geometrical aberrations. The author uses the Eikonal function of
  Bruns to analyze the effects of various types of aberrations, such as spherical
  aberration, coma, astigmatism, curvature of the field, and distortion, on the image
  formation process. The study provides insights into improving the design of optical
  systems, like telescopes, by understanding the interplay between diffraction and
  geometrical aberrations.
