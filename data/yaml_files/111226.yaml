tldr: The author, J. Lockhart Clark, conducted experiments on various animals to study
  the spinal chord and nerve roots. He discovered three types of posterior nerve root
  fibers and found that most nerve fibers proceed directly to the grey substance of
  the spinal chord. The communication between the sensorium and spinal nerves is established
  through the antero-lateral columns, particularly the lateral ones. The author also
  observed a correspondence in the fibrous arrangement between the grey substance
  of the spinal chord and the chiasma of the optic nerves.
