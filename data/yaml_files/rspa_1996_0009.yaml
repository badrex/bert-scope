tldr: The authors develop a theory for calculating cylindrically averaged diffraction
  from ensembles of two-dimensional distorted lattices. They investigate the diffraction
  properties of distorted lattices with circularly symmetric statistics, which can
  be applied to polycrystalline fibers with randomly rotated crystallites and correlated
  molecular displacements. The study has implications for understanding disorder and
  molecular structures in polycrystalline fibers using X-ray diffraction analysis.
