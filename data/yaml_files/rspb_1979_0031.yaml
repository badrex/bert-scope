tldr: This study examines the surface of human chorionic villi and reveals differentiated
  regions associated with placental attachment, phagocytosis of maternal erythrocytes,
  and syncytiotrophoblast repair. The research provides insights into the functional
  differentiation of specific areas of placental cell surface, which is essential
  for placental attachment, maintenance, and fetal nutrition.
