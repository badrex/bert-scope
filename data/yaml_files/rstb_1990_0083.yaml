tldr: This study examines the pH and total alkalinity of three lakes in northern New
  England over the past 300 years, using diatom and chrysophyte remains in sediment
  cores. The results indicate that lake acidification is caused by anthropogenic acid
  deposition, with extreme acid-sensitive lakes like these three being atypical for
  the region. The study also compares pH and alkalinity reconstructions based on different
  calibration equations and methods, providing insights into the effects of anthropogenic
  acid deposition on lakes.
