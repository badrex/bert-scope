tldr: The article presents a unified many-electron theory to analyze charged particles
  added to a perfect insulator using time-independent perturbation theory. The theory
  shows that all added particles, both classical and quantum, interact via a screened
  Coulomb potential when they are far apart. The results establish the general validity
  of the effective-mass equation, which describes the motion of quasiparticles and
  the low-lying excitations of the many-electron system.
