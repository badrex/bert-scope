tldr: The authors describe a novel experimental technique for investigating stimulated
  scattering in liquid media using Bragg reflexion of light. They analyze the modulations
  of dielectric constant generated by stimulated scattering of light from a ruby laser
  in various liquid media using a continuous argon ion laser. The results indicate
  that this technique allows for a comprehensive investigation of the scattering phenomenon
  and is particularly suitable for studying temporal and spatial variations of the
  modulations.
