tldr: The authors study the oblique reflection of sound pulses by imagining a sound
  wave generated by the supersonic motion of a thin wedge. They investigate the motion
  when the wave meets the surface of separation between two media, showing that there
  is a diffused wave in the denser medium with a wave front that precedes the incident
  wave near the surface of separation. This wave is due to diffraction in the lighter
  medium around the edge of the incident wave. The authors also find that there is
  still a reflected wave, and its amplitude is equal in magnitude but opposite in
  sign to that of the incident pulse.
