tldr: This article investigates the Zeeman effects for fine structure components of
  thallium spectral lines. The authors found that the fine structure in thallium spark
  lines caused the observed Zeeman patterns to deviate from the predicted types. The
  study provides experimental information on the behavior of atomic nuclei and electronic
  features of atomic structure.
