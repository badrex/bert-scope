tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the development of surface cracks
  in glasses, particularly in pyrex and quartz glass, using sodium vapor. They found
  that freshly drawn glass showed very few cracks, while older glass had many. The
  presence of surface cracks could explain the difference in mechanical strength between
  fresh and old glass. The authors also observed that the cracks were not caused by
  scratches or drawing marks.
