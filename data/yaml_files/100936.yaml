tldr: Mr. Kirkby reports on an inland sea near Danzick that turns green during dry
  weather, causing the death of animals and birds that consume it. He also mentions
  the discovery of a large piece of white amber in the sea, which supports the idea
  that amber is a bituminous fluid substance hardened by the operations of aqua-aerial
  particles.
