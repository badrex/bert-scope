tldr: The article discusses the prenatal development of the visual system in rhesus
  monkeys, focusing on the generation, migration, and pattern of distribution of neurons
  in the retina, dorsal lateral geniculate body, superior colliculus, and primary
  visual cortex. The study uses the method of [3H]thymidine autoradiography to determine
  the time of origin of neurons and analyze the development of connections in the
  visual system.
