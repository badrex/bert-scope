tldr: The author examines the formation of coal fields and the constitution of the
  Earth's crust through the study of geological structures and pendulum observations.
  He concludes that the arrangement of coal fields into basins is due to the intersection
  of flexures and denudation acting along anticlinal arches. The author's hypothesis
  regarding the Earth's crust is supported by pendulum observations, suggesting that
  the variety in the elevation and depression of the Earth's surface is due to unequal
  contraction in the solidification process.
