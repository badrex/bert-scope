tldr: The authors analyzed the mitochondrial DNA sequences of contemporary and ancient
  human samples to study the phylogenetic relationships among different populations.
  They found that ancient Japanese had a close phylogenetic affiliation with some
  contemporary Japanese and southeast Asians, supporting the immigration theory. The
  study also showed that Circum-Pacific populations can be separated into two distinct
  mitochondrial lineages.
