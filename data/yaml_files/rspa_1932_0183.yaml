tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the adsorption and friction of lubricants
  on surfaces. They discovered that the availability and accessibility of molecules
  in the adsorbed layer are influenced by temperature and the chemical composition
  of the lubricant. The experiments reveal that the friction and adsorption behavior
  of lubricants can be understood in terms of availability and accessibility, which
  are crucial factors in determining the performance of lubricants in various applications.
