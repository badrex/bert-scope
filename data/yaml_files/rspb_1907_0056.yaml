tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cats to study the rate at which chloroform
  is eliminated from the blood during anaesthesia. They found that the rate of elimination
  is crucial in understanding the dangers and effectiveness of chloroform as an anaesthetic
  agent. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of anaesthesia and
  the potential risks associated with using chloroform.
