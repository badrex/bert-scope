tldr: In 1782, chemist James Price claimed to have discovered a way to transmute base
  metals into gold, causing a sensation and drawing the attention of the Royal Society.
  Despite the support of some prominent figures, Price's claims were met with skepticism
  from the scientific community. After a series of experiments, Price eventually agreed
  to repeat his process before representatives of the Royal Society, but his death
  before the experiment could take place left the matter unresolved.
