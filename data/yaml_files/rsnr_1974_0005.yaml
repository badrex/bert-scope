tldr: This article discusses the manuscripts attributed to Thomas Bayes, focusing
  on his electrical and mathematical works. The author explores Bayes' notebook, which
  contains notes on various mathematical texts, tables of numbers, and a section on
  ancient units of length measurement. The article also examines Bayes' comments on
  the ideas of Benjamin Hoadly and Benjamin Wilson, which touch on the central difficulties
  in electrical theory at the time, concerning the role and existence of electrical
  atmospheres. The author confirms and completes the decipherment of Bayes' shorthand
  used in these manuscripts, revealing his insights on electrical and mathematical
  theories of the time.
