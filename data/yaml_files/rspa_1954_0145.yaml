tldr: The authors study the changes in molecular weight distribution of long-chain
  polymers when the main chain is subjected to random fracture, such as when exposed
  to high-energy radiation. They find that after an average of 3 to 8 main-chain fractures
  per molecule, all trace of the initial distribution curve is lost. The shape of
  the curve of weight average against degree of degradation can provide information
  about the initial weight average and molecular weights, allowing for the characterization
  of the initial molecular-weight distribution.
