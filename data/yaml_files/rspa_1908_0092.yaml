tldr: The author examines the Sellmeier dispersion formula and its compatibility with
  observed values of refractive indices and dielectric constants. They find discrepancies
  in the calculated values of X2 and the observed positions of absorption bands for
  various substances. The author discusses possible solutions to these discrepancies
  and suggests the need for alternative dispersion formulas that better align with
  experimental data.
