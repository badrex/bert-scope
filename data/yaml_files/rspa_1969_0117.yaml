tldr: This study investigates the ignition behavior of binary mixtures of n-heptane
  and 1-heptene in oxygen at low temperatures. The results show that both hydrocarbons
  are consumed during ignition, and the alkene's involvement in the process leading
  to ignition depends on the temperature. The reaction between heptyl radicals and
  oxygen forms heptyl-peroxy radicals, which further react to cause ignition. The
  nature of the reaction vessel's surface affects the multiplicity of cool flames
  but not the processes leading to the first cool flame and ignition.
