tldr: This study investigates the thermochemical and thermodynamic aspects of ion
  exchange in a crystalline exchange medium, specifically Linde sieve. The authors
  constructed a simple calorimeter to measure the heats of exchange and used it to
  study the exchange equilibria. The results are discussed in terms of the energetic
  heterogeneity of distribution of cations and other factors, providing insights into
  the exchange process and solid-state reactions in crystals.
