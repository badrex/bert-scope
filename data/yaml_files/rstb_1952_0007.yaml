tldr: The author conducted a study on nuclear division in nine species of small free-living
  amoebae under controlled conditions. They discovered that the resting nucleus has
  a Feulgen-negative nucleolus and Feulgen-positive chromatin granules. The author
  proposed creating two new families, Schizopyrenidae and Hartmannellidae, based on
  the types of nuclear division observed. This new classification system aims to improve
  the understanding of the order Amoebida's phylogeny and evolutionary history.
