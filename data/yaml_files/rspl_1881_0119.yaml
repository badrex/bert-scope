tldr: The author, Professor T.H. Huxley, examines an epidemic disease affecting salmon
  in British rivers, causing skin patches, ulcers, and open sores. The disease is
  caused by a parasitic fungus called Saprolegnia, which is contagious and infectious,
  similar to ringworm in humans or the potato disease. The fungus spreads through
  zoospores, which can infect healthy fish, leading to the spread of the disease.
