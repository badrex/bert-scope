tldr: This study investigates the shifts in frequency of carbon dioxide and carbonyl
  group vibration bands in different solvents. The results suggest that intermolecular
  forces play a significant role in these shifts, rather than just bulk dielectric
  effects. The authors propose that dispersion forces and dipole-induced dipole forces
  are responsible for the observed shifts, and they provide equations to explain these
  interactions. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding the specific
  structural properties of solutes and solvents in predicting solvent effects on vibration
  bands.
