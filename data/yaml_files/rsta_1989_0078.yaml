tldr: This article compares the surface fluxes estimated by two global operational
  numerical weather prediction models, the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather
  Forecasts (ECMWF) and the Meteorological Office (MO), and discusses the reasons
  for differences in their estimates. The study focuses on momentum, sensible heat,
  and latent heat fluxes, highlighting the importance of observation density, analysis
  systems, and model formulations in determining the accuracy of these estimates.
