tldr: This article presents experimental investigations into the variation of specific
  heats of metals at low temperatures, from -273°C to -180°C. The authors developed
  a constant temperature enclosure and utilized the Joule-Thomson cooling effect to
  study the heat capacity of metals like copper, lead, and silver. The results contribute
  to bridging the gap between Nernst's observations at liquid hydrogen and liquid
  air temperatures and higher temperatures.
