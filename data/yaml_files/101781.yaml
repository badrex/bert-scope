tldr: In this letter, Mr. Leewenhoeck describes his observations of the carneous fibers
  of muscles and the cortical and medullar parts of the brain. He uses a microscope
  to study the structure and composition of these tissues, discovering that they consist
  of small globular particles. He also examines the blood vessels in the brain and
  finds them to be extremely fine and numerous, which he believes play a crucial role
  in the brain's function.
