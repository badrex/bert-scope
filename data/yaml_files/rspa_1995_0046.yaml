tldr: The author presents a new theoretical viewpoint on sound generated by propellers
  at an angle of attack. By applying the convected medium Green's function, the analysis
  simplifies and provides exact results for steady and unsteady blade loading with
  propellers tilted at any angle to the flight direction. The study shows that flow
  angularity has a more significant impact on noise levels than unsteady loading in
  many cases.
