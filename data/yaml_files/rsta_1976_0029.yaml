tldr: This article discusses observations of the quiet Sun in the extreme ultraviolet
  region, focusing on the chromosphere, transition region, and corona. The authors
  examine the structure of the network, the distribution of intensities in cell interiors
  and network elements, and the effects of periodic oscillations and non-periodic
  brightenings. They also discuss the center-to-limb behavior of transition region
  and coronal lines, and the construction of coronal models based on these observations.
