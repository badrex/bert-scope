tldr: A young man named Francis Newman lost the use of his hands due to cleaning brass
  wire. After trying various treatments, he was given a mixture of oil and an alkaline
  lixivium to apply as a liniment. This treatment gradually softened the skin on his
  hands, allowing him to regain use of his fingers. The author shares this successful
  treatment method for others who may experience similar hand disorders in the dyeing
  business.
