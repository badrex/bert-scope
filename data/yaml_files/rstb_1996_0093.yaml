tldr: This article explores the role of cephalopods in the diets of various cetacean
  species. Over 80% of odontocete species and two balaen whale species include cephalopods
  in their diet regularly, with some species relying on them as their main food source.
  The most important cephalopod families in the diet of cetaceans are the oceanic
  Ommastrephidae, Histioteuthidae, and Cranchiidae, while neritic Loliginidae are
  more significant on continental shelves. The study highlights the regional, seasonal,
  and annual variations in the species composition of cephalopods consumed by cetaceans
  and the positive correlation between prey size and the size of pelagic feeding cetacean
  species.
