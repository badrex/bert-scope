tldr: This article investigates the stability of viscous flow between rotating cylinders
  in the presence of a magnetic field. The authors extend the theory from a previous
  paper to allow for counter-rotation of the cylinders and provide explicit results
  for the case when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions with equal angular
  velocities. The study helps to determine the critical Taylor number for the onset
  of instability and offers insights into the behavior of fluids in the presence of
  magnetic fields.
