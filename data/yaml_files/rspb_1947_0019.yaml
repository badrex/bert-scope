tldr: The author examines the differentiation of neural crest cells into visceral
  cartilages and odontoblasts in Amblystoma, questioning the germ-layer theory. They
  demonstrate that ectodermal cells from the neural crest differentiate into cartilages
  of the visceral arches, odontoblasts, and possibly dermal bone osteoblasts. The
  author also shows that enamel organs of the teeth can form from ectodermal or endodermal
  cells. The germ-layer theory is found to have no invariable correlation with presumptive
  organ-forming regions or formed structures, leading to its abandonment.
