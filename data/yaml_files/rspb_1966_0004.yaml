tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to study the stereochemistry of
  hydrogen eliminations and C-C bond formations during squalene biosynthesis. They
  used stereospecific chemical reactions and enzymatic methods to determine the absolute
  configuration of hydrogen atoms and the formation of new C-C bonds in the process.
  The results showed that the eliminations and bond formations were stereospecific,
  providing insights into the biosynthesis of cholesterol.
