tldr: This article presents observations of the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's
  first satellite made at Funchal, in Madeira, using a reflecting telescope. The observations
  were conducted by Mr. Bird, Mr. Short, and Thomas Heberden, who recorded the times
  using a quadrant and a pendulum clock. The data collected helped in understanding
  the behavior of Jupiter's satellites and their eclipses.
