tldr: The study investigates the role of the pinna, or external ear, in human sound
  localization and attention. The research demonstrates that the pinna performs an
  essential acoustical transformation that helps in localization and attention to
  sound sources. The mathematical model for this transformation also explains other
  aspects of human hearing, such as pitch perception, speech recognition, and selective
  attention.
