tldr: The authors present efficient algorithms for simulating complex mechanical systems
  using constraint dynamics. They derive the constrained Lagrangian and Hamiltonian
  equations of motion for a general non-relativistic classical mechanical system with
  constraints. The numerical integration of these equations is discussed, and constraint
  errors are avoided using simple correction schemes. The authors demonstrate the
  efficiency of their methods by applying them to a periodically driven inverted n-linked
  pendulum.
