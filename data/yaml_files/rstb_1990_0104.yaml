tldr: The article describes the structure and organization of the nervous system in
  the actinotroch larva of Phoronis vancouverensis. The central element of the system
  is the apical organ, and nerve cell bodies were found only in this area and the
  surrounding apical epithelium. The larval nervous system is highly centralized,
  and the largest nerve in the body is the primary hood nerve, which plays a role
  in neuromuscular control. The article also discusses the comparative and phylogenetic
  implications of the findings.
