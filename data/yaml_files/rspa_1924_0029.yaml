tldr: This article describes a series of experiments that demonstrate a deviation
  from the inverse-square law in the case of alpha particles scattering close to the
  nuclei of aluminum and magnesium. The results suggest the existence of non-electrostatic
  forces at short distances, which play a role in maintaining the equilibrium of atomic
  nuclei.
