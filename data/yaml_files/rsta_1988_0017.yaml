tldr: This article discusses the spectroscopy of the hydrogen molecular ion at its
  dissociation limit. The authors review previous theoretical and experimental work
  on the ion and its deuterium isotopes, and describe spectroscopic studies of the
  vibration-rotation levels. They also discuss the nuclear-hyperfine and spin-rotation
  structure, and present observations of vibration-rotation satellite lines that yield
  absolute values of the deuterium hyperfine constants. The authors describe their
  attempts to observe radiofrequency-infrared double-resonance spectra.
