revised_title: Pressure and Gas Conductivity Effects on Heat Conduction through Powders
scientific_discipline: Physics > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- Heat conduction
- Powder insulation
- Gas conductivity
- Thermal insulation
- Pressure effects
tldr: The authors investigated the conduction of heat through powders and found that
  the conductivity of the powder is linearly related to the logarithm of the pressure
  of the gas in which it is immersed. This relationship is important for understanding
  the thermal insulation properties of powders, cellular, and fibrous substances.
