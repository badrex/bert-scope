tldr: The authors conducted an aeromagnetic survey of the junction region of the Gulf
  of Aden, Red Sea, and Ethiopian rifts to study the structure and evolution of the
  Red Sea and the nature of the junction. They discovered that the region has a mixture
  of continental and oceanic crust and found significant magnetic anomalies that continue
  from the Gulf of Aden into the Red Sea. The survey results provide valuable information
  for understanding the geological history and tectonic processes in the region.
