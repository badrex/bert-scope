tldr: The Abbe Mazeas and other French scientists conducted experiments to verify
  Benjamin Franklin's theories on the analogy between thunder and electricity. They
  successfully replicated Franklin's experiments in France, attracting sparks from
  a pointed iron bar during a storm. These experiments led to further advancements
  in understanding the relationship between thunder, lightning, and electricity.
