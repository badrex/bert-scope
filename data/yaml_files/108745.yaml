tldr: The author, Balfour Stewart, describes the great magnetic disturbance that occurred
  from August 28 to September 7, 1859, and its effects on Earth's magnetic field and
  telecommunication systems. The disturbance coincided with a large solar spot and
  beautiful auroral displays observed worldwide. The Kew Observatory's self-recording
  magnetographs recorded the changes in magnetic elements, revealing two main disturbances
  and a minor one. The impacts of the disturbance included disruptions in telegraph
  communication due to the current produced in the wires. This event is considered
  one of the most intense geomagnetic storms in history.
