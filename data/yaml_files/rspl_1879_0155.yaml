tldr: The author, Alexander J. Ellis, conducted experiments on musical beats and vibrations
  made by tuning forks and organs. He observed the number of beats in a second and
  discovered that the tones form consonances when the partials of the notes fall on
  the same rank or seat. The author also discussed the use of resonance jars to improve
  the accuracy of tuning forks and the effect of temperature on the pitch of the forks.
