tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if the action of a ferment on
  a substrate is affected by surface tension. They found that increasing surface area
  led to a distinct retardation in the inversion of cane sugar by invertase when the
  substrate concentration was relatively high and the ferment concentration was low.
  This suggests that surface tension may affect the combination of enzyme and substrate,
  as well as the chemical change that occurs in the substrate under the influence
  of the ferment.
