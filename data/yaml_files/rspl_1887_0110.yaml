tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study heat conduction in liquids using
  a specially designed apparatus. They measured the temperature changes in the liquid
  and found that the conductivity of most liquids increases rapidly with temperature.
  The results provide valuable insights into the behavior of heat transfer in liquids
  and can be used to improve understanding of heat conduction processes.
