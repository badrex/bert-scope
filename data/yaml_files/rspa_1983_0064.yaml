tldr: This article explores tree models of aggregation where particles bond pairwise
  to form tree-structures, which can represent various applications such as chemical
  polymerization, the precipitin reaction, and cell-surface aggregates in immunology.
  The author uses branching processes to determine the polymer distribution and provides
  criteria for the existence of an infinite aggregate (a gel) and the distribution
  of finite aggregates (the sol). The study also discusses the challenges of incorporating
  ring-formation into graph-theoretic models.
