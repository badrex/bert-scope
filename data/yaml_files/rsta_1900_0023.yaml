tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the electrical conductivity in gases
  when traversed by cathode rays. They found that the gases became conductive due
  to the production of positive and negative ions. The author used an electrometer
  to measure the ionizations produced in different gases and compared the ionizations
  produced by cathode and Rontgen rays.
