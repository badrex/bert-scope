tldr: This article investigates the yield behavior of mild steel under dynamic compression
  using a modified impact apparatus. The authors found that mild steel requires a
  higher stress to cause yield under rapid loading than under slow loading. They also
  discovered that the hardening effect of dynamic working is less than that of static
  working, which has implications for the material's strength properties after dynamic
  straining.
