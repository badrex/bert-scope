tldr: The author, Everard Home, corrects misconceptions about narwhale tusks. He explains
  that the perfect narwhale has only one tusk, which is always in the left socket.
  The tusk is found only in male narwhales, not females. This fact was confirmed by
  comparing male and female skulls. The author also notes that the tusk is not a distinctive
  character for the species, as previously believed.
