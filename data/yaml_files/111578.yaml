tldr: The author presents a new approach to studying elliptic integrals using Jacobi's
  functions as the basis. This method allows for the demonstration of various properties
  and the derivation of new series expansions, including those for the difficult case
  when the parameters are near 1. The approach also leads to the development of over
  thirty new series, some of which are believed to be previously unknown.
