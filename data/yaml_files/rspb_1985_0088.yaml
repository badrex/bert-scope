tldr: The authors studied the central regeneration of an identified molluscan interneuron,
  R.Pe.D.l, in the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. They found that axonal lesion initiates
  extensive neuritic outgrowth from the portion of the interneuron, which is highly
  specific in parts of the brain and peripheral nerves formally innervated by R.Pe.D.l.
  The extent of neuritic sprouting depends on the site of axonal lesion. This research
  provides insights into the accuracy with which connections are reformed following
  neuronal injury in invertebrates.
