tldr: The authors study the magnetic domain configurations in single-crystal plates
  of iron-silicon alloy using X-ray topography. They develop a model using a regular
  octahedron to represent the possible magnetization states and derive rules for domain
  shapes and volumes. The findings help in understanding the hierarchy of domains
  in (112)-orientation plates and provide insights into the magnetization process.
