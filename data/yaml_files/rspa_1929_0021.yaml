tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the sensitivity of the eye
  in counting scintillations produced by alpha particles. They studied factors such
  as the duration of the flashes, the amount of energy required to produce a visual
  sensation, and the influence of the retinal image size on the counting process.
  Their findings provide a better understanding of the scintillation counting method
  and its limitations.
