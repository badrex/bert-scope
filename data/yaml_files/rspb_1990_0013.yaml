tldr: The article describes the development and segmentation of the post-naupliar
  germ band in the amphipod Gammarus pulex. It explains how the ectoderm and mesoderm
  rows form and differentiate, leading to the formation of segments and limbs. The
  study provides insights into the complex process of embryonic development in this
  crustacean species.
