tldr: The authors developed a G-protein-based model for signal transduction in the
  cellular slime mould Dictyostelium discoideum, which can account for the results
  from perfusion experiments. The model predicts excitation, sustained oscillations,
  or spiral waves and target patterns depending on the developmental stage of the
  cells and experimental conditions. The interaction between different pacemakers
  is also studied.
