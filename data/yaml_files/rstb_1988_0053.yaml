tldr: This article discusses the relationship between advanced maternal age and the
  incidence of Down syndrome. It highlights the impact of prenatal diagnosis on reducing
  the number of cases born to mothers over 35 years old. The author also explores
  other factors, such as early diagnosis, survival of low-weight infants, and potential
  changes in the mutation rate, that may contribute to the overall incidence of Down
  syndrome.
