revised_title: 'Thermal Conductivity of Binary Mixtures of Nitrogen and Hydrogen:
  A Comparison of Experimental and Theoretical Values'

tldr: The authors compared experimental and theoretical values of the thermal conductivity
  of binary mixtures of nitrogen and hydrogen. They found that Hirschfelder's theory
  underestimates the thermal conductivity, possibly due to its inexact partition of
  the thermal conductivity for individual constituents. The discrepancies between
  theory and observation are unlikely to be due to errors in the assigned parameters.
