tldr: In a letter to Dr. Hans Sloane, Ralph Thoresby describes the discovery of a
  Roman leaden coffin near York. The coffin was found in a burial site and was surrounded
  by a strong oak wooden coffin. The bones inside the leaden coffin were surprisingly
  well-preserved, despite being buried for possibly 1500 years. Thoresby discusses
  the differences in burial practices between Roman and earlier times, as well as
  the condition of the coffin and its contents.
