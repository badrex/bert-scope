tldr: This study investigates the shear properties of Langmuir-Blodgett layers, focusing
  on the friction and interface shear strength between highly oriented monolayers.
  The research uses molecularly smooth mica substrates and various normal aliphatic
  carboxylic acids and their soaps, deposited with the Langmuir-Blodgett technique.
  The results show that most monolayers provide a continuous rate of energy dissipation
  and that the interface shear strength is influenced by contact variables such as
  normal load, temperature, and sliding velocity.
