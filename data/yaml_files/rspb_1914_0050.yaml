tldr: The authors conducted a study in the Upper Shire Valley to investigate the presence
  of trypanosomes in wild Glossina morsitans and wild game. They discovered that the
  same four species of trypanosomes found in the Proclaimed Sleeping Sickness Area
  were present in the area, and that these trypanosomes caused disease in dogs and
  goats. The study also found that the tsetse flies in the Upper Shire district carried
  the same trypanosome species, which likely means that cases of sleeping sickness
  will be found among the local natives.
