tldr: The author examines the iridescent colours displayed by labradorite and investigates
  the structures responsible for these colours. They discover that the colours are
  due to thin plates of inclusions in the mineral, and that the diffuse coloured reflection
  is associated with a specific plane in the crystal structure. This research provides
  insight into the physical and chemical properties of labradorite and other minerals
  with iridescent colours.
