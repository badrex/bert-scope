tldr: This study presents a new model of feature detection in human vision based on
  a phase-dependent energy concept. The model suggests that points in a waveform with
  unique perceptual significance as lines and edges are where the Fourier components
  of the waveform come into phase with each other, resulting in maximal local energy.
  The model was tested with a series of images and shown to predict well the position
  of perceived features and the organization of the images.
