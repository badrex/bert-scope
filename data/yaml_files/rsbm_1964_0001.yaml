tldr: Kenneth Bailey was a devoted protein chemist who, alongside his friend and collaborator
  W.T. Astbury, made significant contributions to the field of protein chemistry.
  Bailey's work focused on understanding protein denaturation, enzyme kinetics, and
  the structure of muscle proteins. His research on artificial wool and the study
  of intermediary protein degradation products were groundbreaking and helped shape
  the future of protein chemistry.
