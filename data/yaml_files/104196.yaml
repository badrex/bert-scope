tldr: This article delves into the advanced concepts of calculus and fluxions, focusing
  on higher order quantities and their applications. It covers topics such as algebraic
  expressions, the direct and inverse methods, and the use of fluxions in geometry
  and mathematical analysis. The author demonstrates various theorems and principles,
  including the binomial theorem, the resolution of fractions, and the construction
  of elastic curves.
