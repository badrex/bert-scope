tldr: The authors investigated the structure and development of dentine, focusing
  on the role of connective tissue calcification. They found that dentine formation
  is more similar to bone formation than previously thought, and that the process
  involves a combination of connective tissue fibers and cells. The study used advanced
  microscopy techniques to analyze dentine from various mammalian teeth, including
  human, rat, and elephant specimens.
