tldr: The authors investigated a self-sustained reaction between solid iron and potassium
  permanganate, studying the reaction rates and mechanisms. They found that the thermal
  conduction theory of propagation accurately describes the reaction, and the reaction
  rates can be calculated using this theory. The authors also discussed the products
  of the reaction and the role of temperature and reaction on the thermal conductivity
  of the materials.
