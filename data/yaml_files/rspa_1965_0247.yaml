tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the viscosity and acoustic impedance
  of liquid helium-3. They found that the transition temperature of the impedance
  decreases and the magnitude of the change is reduced when the liquid is subjected
  to pressure. The results support Landau's theory of a Fermi liquid and the existence
  of zero sound in helium-3.
