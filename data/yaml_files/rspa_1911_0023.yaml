tldr: The authors describe the process of separating ionium and actinium from pitchblende
  residues. They used a series of chemical treatments to isolate the radioactive materials,
  which were then analyzed for their activity. The separation process was successful
  in isolating ionium, but not actinium at the right point. The authors also discovered
  that the presence of fluorine in the hydrogen peroxide solution used for precipitation
  had caused difficulties in the decomposition of the precipitate.
