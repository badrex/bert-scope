tldr: The author presents a case study of a lady who experienced various nervous symptoms,
  such as numbness, tingling, and muscle contractions, after exposure to severe cold.
  Dr. Parry found that applying pressure to the carotid arteries stopped these symptoms,
  suggesting that excessive blood flow into the brain's vessels caused the irritation.
  This discovery could lead to new treatments for nervous disorders.
