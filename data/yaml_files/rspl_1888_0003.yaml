tldr: The author presents a study on the radio-micrometer, an instrument consisting
  of a thermo-electric circuit suspended by a torsion fiber in a strong magnetic field.
  The paper discusses the optimization of the instrument's design, including the best
  proportions, sectional area, and moment of inertia. The author also addresses the
  effects of resistance and magnetic fields on the instrument's sensitivity and dead-beat
  performance.
