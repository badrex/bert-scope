tldr: This study investigates the suitability of canine Purkinje strands for voltage-clamp
  experiments and characterizes the membrane currents present in the plateau and diastolic
  potential range. The results show that the canine Purkinje strand has wide extracellular
  clefts, which reduce the impact of variations in extracellular ion concentration.
  The presence of a pacemaker current in canine Purkinje strands is significant, as
  it was absent in rabbit Purkinje strand studies. The voltage-clamp set-up and experimental
  procedures are described, and the electrophysiological properties and membrane currents
  are analyzed.
