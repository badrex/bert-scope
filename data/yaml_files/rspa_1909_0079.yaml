tldr: The author proposes using wave-length rulings as defining lines on standards
  of length, such as the Imperial Standard Yard, to improve measurement accuracy.
  They describe a new type of defining mark called a "Tutton location signal" and
  suggest its possible use in determining the number of wave-lengths of red cadmium
  light contained in the British yard.
