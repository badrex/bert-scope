tldr: The author investigates the properties of a spherically symmetric shell of radiation
  expanding in empty space, using the principles of general relativity. They analyze
  the behavior of the shell and its boundaries, showing that the concept of the shell
  is consistent with general relativity. The study also examines the expanding shell's
  history and the conditions under which the shell can be considered a valid model.
