tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the factors affecting electric
  conduction in various materials. They discovered that the conductivity of metals
  and other materials increases when heated, and that the electric fluid flows more
  easily through hot materials. The author also explained the phenomenon of volcanic
  lightning, attributing it to the easy passage of the electric fluid through the
  rarefied air in the volcanic crater.
