tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the conditions of deliquescence of
  crystalline salts found in the air and their role in the formation of haze, fog,
  and condensation. They developed a method to examine these crystals by observing
  their behavior under the microscope when exposed to varying temperature and humidity.
  The results support the theory that the vapor pressure of the saturated solution
  determines the conditions of deliquescence.
