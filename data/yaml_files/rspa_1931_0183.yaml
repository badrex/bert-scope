tldr: This study investigates the thermal conductivities of gaseous saturated hydrocarbons,
  focusing on methane, ethane, propane, butane, pentane, and hexane. The research
  uses the hotwire method to measure the thermal conductivities and temperature coefficients
  of these gases. The results show a slight increase in conductivity with pressure,
  which is attributed to convection. The findings contribute to understanding heat
  transfer in hydrocarbon gases and their applications in various industries.
