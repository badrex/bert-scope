tldr: The author investigates the adaptation of \lt;italic\gt;Bact. coli mutabile\lt;/italic\gt;
  to lactose and discovers that the time needed for colony development on lactose-agar
  progressively diminishes during the lag phase in a liquid lactose medium. This indicates
  an adaptive process occurring in the bacteria. The growth rate of newly adapted
  strains is initially variable, and the author criticizes recent arguments about
  the mutational nature of these phenomena in light of the new evidence.
