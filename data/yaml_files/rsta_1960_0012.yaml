tldr: The authors develop a general theory for the temperature distribution in tungsten
  vacuum lamps, focusing on their application in brightness pyrometry. They simplify
  the properties of tungsten, assuming that resistivity and emissivity vary directly
  with temperature, while thermal conductivity remains constant. This allows for a
  complete solution of the main differential equation governing temperature distribution.
  The theory is mainly applicable to two types of vacuum lamps used in optical pyrometry,
  providing a method for estimating their main characteristics and suggesting modifications
  in their design.
