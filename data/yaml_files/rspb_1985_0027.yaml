tldr: This study investigates the response of blood lead to airborne and dietary lead
  exposure in volunteer experiments using lead isotopes. The research focuses on understanding
  the uptake, distribution, and excretion of lead in the human body, which is essential
  for predicting the effects of lead exposure on blood lead levels. The findings can
  help in developing strategies to mitigate the impact of lead on human health.
