tldr: This study examines the role of unspecialized pollinators, particularly beetles,
  in the reproductive success of Aldabran plants. The Aldabra atoll has a diverse
  but small flora, making it an ideal location to study plant-pollinator interactions.
  The research found that while specialized pollinator-plant relationships are rare,
  generalist pollinators like beetles and birds play a significant role in the reproductive
  success of Aldabran plants. Beetles, specifically Mausoleopsis aldabrensis, were
  observed visiting 58% of the plant species observed in flower on Aldabra, making
  them efficient pollen transfer agents.
