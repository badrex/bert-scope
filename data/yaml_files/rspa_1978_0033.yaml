tldr: This article presents a study on the response of inhomogeneous elastic halfspaces
  to surface sources, extending Lamb's problem. The authors develop a method to directly
  solve the stress equations of motion for heterogeneous media, allowing them to compute
  theoretical seismograms for surface displacements due to point loads. They observe
  a pseudo wave, similar to the one described by Gilbert and Laster, which appears
  after the refracted wave. The study highlights the importance of understanding inhomogeneous
  media for applications in seismology and materials science.
