tldr: The authors studied the tanning reaction in the oothecae of cockroaches, specifically
  the interaction between the secretions of the two colleterial glands. They discovered
  that the left gland secretes a polyphenol oxidase and the 4-O-β-glucoside of protocatechuic
  acid, while the right gland secretes a β-glucosidase. When mixed, the secretions
  interact, and the β-glucosidase liberates protocatechuic acid from its β-glucoside.
  The resulting acid is then oxidized in the presence of the oxidase to a quinone,
  which forms cross-linkages between adjacent molecules of the structural protein,
  creating sclerotin. This research provides a new understanding of the sclerotization
  process in insect oothecae.
