tldr: This article explores the thermal explosion theory with Arrhenius kinetics in
  inhomogeneous media. It considers a slab with a random distribution of reactants
  and replaces it with a homogeneous medium with an effective temperature distribution
  and thermal diffusivity. The analysis shows that a random distribution decreases
  the thermal stability when compared to criticality with mean properties.
