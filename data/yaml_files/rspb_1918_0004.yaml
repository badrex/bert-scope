tldr: 'The author discusses the two types of body symmetry found in animals: bilateral
  and radial. They explore how these symmetries are related to the habits and habitats
  of animals, and how they evolve over time. The study focuses on sea-pens, a type
  of marine invertebrate, and how their symmetry is linked to their lifestyle and
  environment. The author also examines the variability and plasticity in growth of
  radially symmetrical animals, which can help them adapt to different environmental
  conditions.'
