tldr: The author discusses the importance of sensory impressions and sensory centres
  in the production of voluntary movements. They argue against the existence of motor
  centres in the cerebral cortex and propose that sensory impressions and the activity
  of sensory centres guide voluntary actions. The author also explains how speech
  movements and reading aloud involve the interaction between different sensory centres
  in the brain.
