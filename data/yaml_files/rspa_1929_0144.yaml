tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of ionized nitrogen (N II) and identified
  nine quintet multiplets, providing a better understanding of the atomic structure
  and energy levels of nitrogen ions. This research contributes to the study of atomic
  and molecular processes in astrophysical environments.
