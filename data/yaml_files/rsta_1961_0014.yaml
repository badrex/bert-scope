tldr: The article discusses the concept of classes of extensions and resolutions in
  homological algebra. It introduces -functors, which are used to construct resolutions
  and derive functors. The article also explores the relations between derived functors
  and the construction of relative homological algebras using ideals in the ring of
  endomorphisms or pairs of adjoint functors. The concepts are applied to group theory,
  spectral sequences, and sheaf theory.
