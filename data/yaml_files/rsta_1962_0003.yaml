tldr: The authors develop a molecular theory to explain the propagation of electromagnetic
  waves in two-component anisotropic polymer systems. They consider the scattering
  properties of individual particles and the interactions between them, leading to
  the concept of refractive index and birefringence in these systems. The theory is
  applicable to strained amorphous polymers and helps understand the behavior of light
  in these materials.
