tldr: The author presents a method for representing polyhedra and their sympolar pairs
  through a system of numbered faces and summits. This method allows for the creation
  of paradigms that display the relationships between the faces and summits of a polyhedron,
  leading to a better understanding of their symmetry and structure.
