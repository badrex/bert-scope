tldr: The article proposes a research program for inferring unpreserved attributes
  of extinct taxa using both phylogenetic information and extrapolations from known
  features of the fossil. The phylogenetic approach involves a broader comparative
  context based on the outgroup algorithm, while extrapolatory approaches depend on
  established biological generalizations. The study compares phylogenetic and extrapolatory
  methods for reconstructing the shoulder musculature of the ornithomimid Struthiomimus,
  highlighting the importance of a precise research program to reduce speculation
  in fossil reconstruction.
