tldr: This article investigates solar radiation at radio frequencies and its connection
  to sunspots. The authors discovered that the radiation has characteristics similar
  to thermal radiation but is much stronger. They found a correlation between the
  day-to-day intensity variations and sunspots. Using directional observations, they
  determined that the radiation originates in restricted areas near sunspot groups,
  suggesting that another mechanism, possibly electrical discharges, produces the
  radiation.
