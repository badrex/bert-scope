tldr: The study investigates the production of lactic acid in desiccated amphibian
  muscles and finds that simple drying causes the same amount of lactic acid production
  as freezing. The research confirms that the effects of freezing and drying are identical,
  with the main factor being the removal of water from the muscle. The findings suggest
  that the formation of lactic acid in frozen muscle is due to the removal of water
  and this factor alone.
