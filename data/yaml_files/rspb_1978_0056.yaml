tldr: This article discusses the genetics and biochemistry of the ABO, Lewis, and
  P blood group systems. It explains how the antigenic structures associated with
  these systems are carbohydrates and are secondary products of the blood group genes.
  The article also describes the role of genes in the formation of these structures
  and the enzymes that control their biosynthesis. Furthermore, it highlights the
  importance of understanding the biochemical pathways for the biosynthesis of blood
  group antigens in the context of malignant transformation.
