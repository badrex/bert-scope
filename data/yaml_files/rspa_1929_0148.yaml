tldr: The author investigates the fluorescent and phosphorescent excitation of mercury
  vapor using various frequencies and sources. They discover that the fluorescence
  can be excited by frequencies lower than the resonance line, and the fluorescence
  spectrum consists of broad, structureless bands with maxima at 3300 and 4850. The
  findings challenge the previous understanding of fluorescence and suggest that the
  process is more complex than previously thought.
