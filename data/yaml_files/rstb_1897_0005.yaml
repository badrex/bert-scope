tldr: The author investigates the segmental representation of movements in the lumbar
  region of the mammalian spinal cord by exciting either the root or directly stimulating
  the spinal cord segments. The study focuses on understanding the relationship between
  the representation of one movement and another, and the localization of movements
  in the spinal cord. The results show that the postero-external column is the most
  excitable area on the spinal cord surface, and the method of direct excitation provides
  precise and accurate results.
