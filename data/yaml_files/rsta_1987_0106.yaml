tldr: The article discusses the evolution of atmospheric chemistry research, focusing
  on the challenges posed by global-scale problems such as methane, carbon dioxide,
  and sodium increases in the troposphere and stratosphere, as well as shifts in biogeochemical
  cycles and photochemical changes. It highlights recent developments in satellite,
  balloon-borne, and ground-based experimental methods, and model calculations, emphasizing
  the transition from a descriptive science to one that predicts secular trends.
