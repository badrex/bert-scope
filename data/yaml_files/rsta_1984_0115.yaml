tldr: This article discusses the concept of optical bistability in semiconductor lasers,
  exploring absorptive, dispersive, and modal bistabilities. The authors present experimental
  results using twin-stripe injection lasers, demonstrating an optical flip-flop and
  discussing various mode patterns. The potential applications of these active bistable
  devices in front-end optical signal processing are also considered.
