tldr: The author investigates the equilibrium of fluids and the figure of a homogeneous
  planet in a fluid state. He considers the essential properties of fluids and the
  conditions required for equilibrium. The author discusses the hypothesis of Clairaut
  and shows that the same results follow from it as from the general theory. He also
  applies the problem to the determination of the figure of equilibrium of a homogeneous
  mass of fluid entirely at liberty and concludes that the form of the fluid in equilibrium
  is an oblate elliptical spheroid of revolution.
