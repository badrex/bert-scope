tldr: This study investigates the effects of biological adjuvants on skin grafting
  across the H-Y barrier in mice. The results show that adjuvants can have immunopotentiating
  or enhancing effects depending on the treatment conditions. The H-Y barrier skin
  grafting technique appears to be a useful tool for studying adjuvants and their
  mechanisms of action, which is essential for optimizing their use in cancer treatment.
