tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cells consisting of certain metals, platinum,
  and nitric acid to study the variations of electromotive force. They found that
  the electromotive force increases when nitrous acid is produced, and the final value
  is due to the nitrous acid alone. The authors also discovered that the rise of electromotive
  force is affected by factors such as temperature, impurity, and concentration of
  the acid. They propose further investigations on cells containing other acids to
  determine if their action on metals is conditioned by their products of electrolysis.
