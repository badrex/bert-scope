tldr: The author, Stephen Hales, proposed a method for injecting liquids into the
  abdomen during tapping operations to treat dropsy. The method involves using two
  trochars, one for injecting the medicinal liquid and the other for removing the
  dropsical lymph. This allows for continuous fluid exchange and prevents syncope
  from inanition. The height of the liquid can be adjusted to control the distension
  of the abdomen.
