tldr: This article presents a detailed analysis of the growth of high-frequency electrodeless
  discharges in gases at low pressure. The authors explain the initial stage of the
  discharge, where secondary emission from the end-walls controls the multiplication
  process, and the later stages where gas properties determine the total growth of
  the discharge. They employ a new experimental technique to measure the discharge
  current and compare their results with theoretical predictions, demonstrating good
  agreement.
