tldr: This study investigates the mechanical properties and matrix cracking behavior
  of SiC-CAS composites reinforced with Nicalon fibers. The elastic properties of
  the composites are close to the values predicted from constituent properties, but
  their strengths are lower than expected due to degraded fibers during manufacturing.
  The fracture energy is higher than predicted, and the matrix cracking stress can
  be reasonably predicted by the Aveston, Cooper, and Kelly model of cracking in brittle
  matrix composites.
