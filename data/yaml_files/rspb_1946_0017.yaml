tldr: 'The author studied the larval cuticle of Sarcophaga falculata, focusing on
  its structure and composition. The cuticle consists of two main layers: the outer
  epicuticle and the inner endocuticle. The epicuticle is a double structure with
  no chitin, while the endocuticle is a laminated chitin-protein complex. The study
  also examines the role of pore canals in the cuticle and the changes that occur
  during the formation of the puparium.'
