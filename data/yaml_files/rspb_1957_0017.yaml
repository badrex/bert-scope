tldr: This study compares the time course of action of acetylcholine and stable depolarizing
  agents using the ionophoretic method. The results show that acetylcholine has a
  faster time course of action than other drugs. The difference in time course between
  acetylcholine and carbaminoylcholine effects becomes insignificant when the muscle
  is treated with prostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor. The study suggests that
  the difference in time course observed in normal conditions is due to the faster
  removal of acetylcholine from its site of action by enzymatic hydrolysis in addition
  to diffusion.
