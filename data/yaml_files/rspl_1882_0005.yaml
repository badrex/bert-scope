tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific resistance of mercury
  and compared their results with previous studies. They used four tubes of varying
  lengths and diameters to measure the resistance and found that the value of the
  mercury unit is close to that of Siemens' experiments. The results were combined
  with the determination of the B.A. unit in absolute measure to obtain the resistance
  in CGS units.
