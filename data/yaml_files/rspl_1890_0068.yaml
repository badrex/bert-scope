tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the effect of light, air, and
  dry soils on the virulence of the tuberculosis bacillus. The results showed that
  exposure to light and fresh air, as well as dry conditions, reduced the virulence
  of the bacillus. These findings suggest that improving living conditions, such as
  ventilation and cleanliness, could help mitigate the spread of tuberculosis.
