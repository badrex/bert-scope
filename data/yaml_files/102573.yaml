tldr: The author, Mr. Walker, conducted a series of experiments to measure the speed
  of sound and study sound reflection. He used pendulums, measured distances, and
  observed echoes in various locations. The author found that sound moves faster in
  calm conditions and that the speed of sound is influenced by the environment, such
  as walls and other reflective surfaces. This research contributed to the understanding
  of sound propagation and reflection.
