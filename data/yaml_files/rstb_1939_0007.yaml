tldr: The author studied the spiral structure and chromosome pairing in the plant
  Osmunda Regalis using various technical methods. They found that the apparent shape
  of the chromosome is an external form of a spiral coil, which has significant implications
  for understanding chromosome behavior. The study provides detailed observations
  and measurements of the chromosomes, contributing to the knowledge of spiral structure
  in cytology.
