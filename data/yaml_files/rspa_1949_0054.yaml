tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the turbulent wake of a cylinder to study
  the turbulent transfer of energy and momentum. They discovered that the turbulent
  motion within the jets is solely responsible for the turbulent transfer of momentum,
  while diffusion of turbulent energy and heat is carried out by the bulk movement
  of the jets. The study provides a self-consistent description of the wake, which
  represents the main features of wake motion.
