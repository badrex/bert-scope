tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if goats are susceptible to Malta
  fever and if the disease can be transmitted to humans through goats. They found
  that goats can be infected with the Micrococcus melitensis bacterium and that their
  blood serum can agglutinate the bacteria. This suggests that goats may be a source
  of infection for humans.
