tldr: 'The author investigated the absorption spectra of benzene and its homologues
  at different temperatures and pressures, as well as in solutions. They discovered
  that the mode of vibration within the benzene nucleus is mostly unaffected by side-chain
  substitution. The study also revealed two types of absorption: general absorption,
  which is influenced by temperature, and selective absorption, which is best studied
  by reducing pressure.'
