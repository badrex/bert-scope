tldr: The author investigates the anaerobic fructolysis, lactic acid production, and
  heat production in bull spermatozoa. They found that on average, more fructose was
  broken down than lactic acid produced. The amount of heat produced by the spermatozoa
  was only 9% more than the heat expected based on the enthalpy change associated
  with the breakdown of fructose to lactic acid. The study discusses the implications
  of these findings in relation to the metabolic pathways in anaerobic bull spermatozoa.
