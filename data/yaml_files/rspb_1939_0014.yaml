tldr: The author investigates the role of blue-green algae in nitrogen fixation in
  rice fields. They find that blue-green algae, specifically Anabaena and Phormidium
  species, play a significant role in nitrogen fixation in waterlogged rice fields.
  This discovery could have implications for sustainable agriculture and improving
  soil fertility in rice cultivation.
