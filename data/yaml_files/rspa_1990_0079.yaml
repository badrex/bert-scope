tldr: This study examines the interaction between stationary crossflow vortices and
  Tollmien-Schlichting waves in the boundary layer of a rotating disc. The research
  focuses on understanding the effects of these vortices on the stability characteristics
  of the waves and how they can stabilize or destabilize the waves depending on their
  orientation. The findings can help improve the understanding of fluid flow instabilities
  and the development of laminar control wings.
