tldr: This study examines the recolonization of the Krakatau Islands and adjacent
  areas of West Java by bats (Chiroptera) from 1883 to 1986. The research found that
  25 species of bats, including pteropodids and microchiropterans, have recolonized
  the islands. Pteropodids were the first bat colonists of the Krakatau archipelago,
  while microchiropterans arrived more recently. The study highlights the importance
  of bat movements between the islands and the mainland in the reestablishment of
  vegetation.
