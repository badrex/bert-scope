tldr: The author presents a method for comparing human skulls, specifically Homo sapiens
  and Homo neandertalensis, by analyzing their sagittal sections. The study reveals
  differences in the shape and size of the skulls, with Homo neandertalensis having
  larger nasion angles than Homo sapiens. This method can be used to better understand
  the differences between these two species and their evolutionary relationships.
