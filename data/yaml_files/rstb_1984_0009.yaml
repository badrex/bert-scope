tldr: This study investigates the effects of different gas mixtures on the high-pressure
  neurological syndrome experienced by animals and humans during deep diving. The
  researchers found that all gases tested provided some protection against the syndrome,
  but certain phases were more effectively controlled than others. The composition
  of therapeutic gas mixtures becomes more narrowly defined as the pressure increases,
  and the optimum mixture may be different for each phase of the syndrome. The study
  also explores the potential benefits and limitations of various gas mixtures, including
  helium-nitrogen and other gases, in deep diving scenarios.
