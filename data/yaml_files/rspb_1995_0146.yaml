tldr: This study investigates the structure and composition of hepatopancreal granules
  from the snail Helix aspersa and the shore crab Carcinus maenas using X-ray diffraction
  and multinuclear solid-state NMR. The granules are found to be amorphous and composed
  of pyrophosphate and orthophosphate. The NMR results indicate that water is evenly
  distributed throughout the pyrophosphate granules, and the orthophosphate granules
  show water movement facilitated by the organic component. The findings provide insights
  into the biological significance of these inorganic granules in invertebrates.
