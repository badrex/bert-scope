tldr: The article discusses the use of satellite-borne measurements to study the composition
  of the middle atmosphere. The Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder (SAMS) experiment
  on the Nimbus 7 satellite and the Improved Stratospheric and Mesospheric Sounder
  (ISAMS) on the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite are used to analyze methane and
  nitrous oxide concentrations. These measurements help to understand the circulation
  and behavior of the middle atmosphere, as well as the sources and sinks of minor
  atmospheric constituents.
