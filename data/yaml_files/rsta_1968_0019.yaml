tldr: This article discusses the impact of fluctuating noise levels on human perception
  and proposes methods for calculating the disturbance caused by varying noise amplitudes
  and durations in industrial environments. The author suggests that shorter noise
  durations allow for higher noise levels without causing the same level of annoyance,
  and provides examples of how different noise compositions affect human perception.
