tldr: The authors describe an experimental approach to study protein folding and stability
  using protein engineering and kinetic measurements. They focus on barnase, an RNAse
  from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens, to analyze the folding pathway and the role of
  individual side chains in stabilizing the folded, transition, and intermediate states
  of the protein. The findings provide insights into the essence of enzymic catalysis
  and the structure of folding intermediates.
