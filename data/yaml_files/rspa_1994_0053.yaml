tldr: This study investigates the acoustic field generated by a vortex ring passing
  near a sharp wedge at low Mach numbers. The authors found that the acoustic intensity
  and wave profile's time history depend on the wedge angle, and the radiated sound
  is significantly attenuated when the vortex ring moves nearly parallel to the wedge's
  edge. The findings can be applied to the study of airfoil trailing edges and the
  efficiency of sound generation in aerodynamic systems.
