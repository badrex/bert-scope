tldr: The author, Peter Barlow, conducted experiments to study the effect of heat
  on the magnetic properties of iron. He discovered an anomalous magnetic action in
  iron when heated between the white and blood-red heat. The iron's magnetic attraction
  changed direction at a specific temperature range, and this behavior was influenced
  by the position of the compass relative to the iron bar. Barlow also found that
  the negative attraction was affected by the height or depth of the iron bar's center
  from the compass. He suggested that the anomalies might be due to the iron cooling
  faster at its extremities than at its center, causing one part of the bar to become
  magnetic before the other.
