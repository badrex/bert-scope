tldr: In 1868, Dr. William B. Carpenter and Dr. Wyville Thomson conducted deep-sea
  dredging operations in the North Seas to study the marine life and physics of the
  ocean. Despite limited time and weather constraints, they discovered new facts about
  the ocean's animal life and corrected previous misconceptions. They found that the
  deeper the water, the colder the temperature, and the marine fauna consisted of
  a mix of British and Boreal species. Their work laid the foundation for more extensive
  future inquiries into oceanic life and the environment.
