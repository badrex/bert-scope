tldr: The authors studied the behavior of electric probes in gaseous detonation, focusing
  on the effects of the motion of plasma. They developed a probe design that avoids
  issues with moving gas streams and uses inherent turbulence to simplify ion collection.
  The experimental results indicate an "overshoot" of ionization 16 behind the detonation
  front, followed by a slow decay to a value in agreement with theoretically calculated
  equilibrium ion concentrations. Electron temperatures were also determined using
  double probe methods and a new technique that provides the plasma's floating potential
  at the detonation wave front.
