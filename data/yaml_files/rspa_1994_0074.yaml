tldr: The authors present an exact representation of N-wave solutions for the non-planar
  Burgers equation, which describes the propagation of weakly nonlinear longitudinal
  waves in fluids or gases. They find that the solution tends to the inviscid solution
  for large initial Reynolds numbers and to the linear solution as time tends to infinity.
  This study compares their results with those of Crighton and Scott (1979).
