tldr: The authors present a precise calculation of the normal modes of oscillation
  of an ocean of uniform depth bounded by two meridians of longitude. The calculation
  takes into account the horizontal divergence of motion, making it applicable to
  both barotropic and baroclinic modes of oscillation. They find new types of oscillations
  with concentrated energy flux near the equator and compare the calculated frequencies
  with asymptotic expressions derived from a recent -plane analysis. The study is
  relevant to understanding the possible types of oscillation in ocean basins and
  the response of the ocean to external forces.
