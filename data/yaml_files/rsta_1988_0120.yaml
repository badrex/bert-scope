tldr: This article discusses the geological evolution of the Tibetan Plateau, focusing
  on a geotraverse study conducted in 1985. The study aimed to understand the mechanism
  behind the plateau's formation and the doubling of its crust thickness. Chinese
  and British geologists collaborated on this project, which involved exploring and
  mapping the region, leading to new insights into the Earth's collision tectonics.
