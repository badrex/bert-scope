tldr: This article discusses the forces between atoms and ions, focusing on the intrinsic
  repulsive forces and electrostatic attraction. The authors present a table of force
  constants that can be used in theoretical calculations of crystal structures and
  explain the differences between the forces in various types of crystals. They also
  introduce the concept of "diameters" as a measure of the size of the outer shell
  of electrons in ions.
