tldr: This article investigates the effects of dilution on the explosive combustion
  of hydrocarbons, specifically ethylene and acetylene, with oxygen. The authors found
  that dilution with helium, argon, and nitrogen had little effect on the combustion
  process until near the limit of inflammability. However, when diluted with hydrogen,
  the combustion process resulted in some carbon formation without noticeable carbon
  deposition. The study suggests that the mean maximum flame temperature plays a significant
  role in the process, with both carbon deposition and steam formation becoming more
  noticeable as the flame temperature decreases.
