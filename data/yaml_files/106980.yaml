tldr: The article describes a rare case of a human heart with a single auricle and
  ventricle, and a unique circulation system. The heart was situated in the abdomen
  and had a different structure than the typical four-chambered heart. This unusual
  formation led to a mix of dark and florid blood in the arteries, which may have
  affected the infant's health and survival.
