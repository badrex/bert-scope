tldr: The author's experiments with freshwater algae reveal that plants can absorb
  nitrogen from the atmosphere, challenging previous beliefs that nitrogen is obtained
  from the soil. This discovery sheds light on the process of photosynthesis and the
  evolution of life, as it shows that plants can obtain essential nutrients from the
  air, not just the soil.
