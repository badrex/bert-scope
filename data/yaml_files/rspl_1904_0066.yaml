tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate if an electromotive force is
  induced in a dielectric when it moves in a magnetic field, as predicted by Maxwell's
  electromagnetic theory, as developed by H. A. Lorentz and Larmor. The results showed
  that a radial electric displacement is produced in a dielectric, such as ebonite,
  when it is rotated in a magnetic field parallel to the axis of revolution. The findings
  confirmed the theories of Lorentz and Larmor.
