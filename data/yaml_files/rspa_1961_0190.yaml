tldr: The authors studied the stability of viscous flow in a curved channel under
  the influence of a magnetic field. They found that the critical number for the onset
  of instability depends on the strength of the magnetic field and the electrical
  conductivity of the fluid. The research has implications for understanding fluid
  behavior in various engineering and scientific applications.
