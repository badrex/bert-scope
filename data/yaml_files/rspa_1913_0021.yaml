revised_title: Mixed Crystal Formation and Phase Transitions in Bromnitrobenzene and
  Chlornitrobenzene Mixtures

tldr: The authors studied the crystallization and melting/freezing point curves of
  mixtures of p-bromnitrobenzene and p-chlornitrobenzene, which form mixed crystals.
  They discovered that the mixtures exhibit a transition point in their freezing point
  curve, indicating a change in the nature of the crystals. The authors also found
  two different types of mixed crystals with distinct melting points, which they labeled
  as types 'a' and 'ft'.
