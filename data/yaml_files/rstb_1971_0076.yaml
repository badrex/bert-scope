tldr: This article discusses the storage, intracellular transport, and release of
  neurotransmitter substances in neurons. It highlights the advantages of exocytosis,
  a process in which vesicles containing neurotransmitters fuse with the cell membrane
  and release their contents into the extracellular space. The author explores the
  implications of exocytosis for neurotransmitter substances, the coupling between
  the stimulus to the cell and secretion, the cellular dynamics of neurons, and the
  tissue innervated by neurons.
