tldr: The study investigates the P sector of the rabbit's dorsal lateral geniculate
  nucleus, a small region of nerve cells that resembles the perigeniculate nucleus
  of carnivores. The research explores the retinogeniculate, geniculocortical, and
  corticogeniculate pathways in rabbits using horseradish peroxidase and radioactively
  labeled proline. The findings reveal similarities between the P sector and the perigeniculate
  nucleus, suggesting a common developmental origin, but the functional differences
  remain to be explored.
