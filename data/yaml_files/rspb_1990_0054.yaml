tldr: The authors demonstrate that cetaceans, such as whales and dolphins, can absorb
  energy from ocean waves to help with propulsion. They explain how flukes of cetaceans
  can absorb up to 25-33% of the required propulsive power in different sea conditions.
  This energy absorption can have consequences for the energetics of cetacean migrations.
