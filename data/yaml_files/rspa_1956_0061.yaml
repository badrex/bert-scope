tldr: The authors explore the use of a tetrad vector field to create field relations
  that allow for the creation of matter. They show that certain tetrad fields, such
  as those discovered by H. P. Robertsom and A. G. Walker, conform to the cosmological
  principle and can be used to derive cosmological models. This work suggests that
  tetrad fields may be a suitable potential field for further mathematical study of
  the possibility of continuous creation.
