tldr: The authors explore the wave structure of monochromatic electromagnetic radiation,
  identifying structurally stable features of the three-dimensional pattern of polarization.
  They introduce the concept of lines and surfaces where the electric or magnetic
  vibration ellipse is singular, and discuss the implications for the analysis of
  electromagnetic wavefields.
