tldr: The authors discuss the progress made in understanding and controlling migrant
  pests, particularly locusts, through advances in meteorology and remote sensing
  techniques. They emphasize the importance of integrating physical and biological
  aspects of the problem and suggest the need for a joint FAO/WMO research program
  to monitor and combat outbreaks of migrant pests effectively.
