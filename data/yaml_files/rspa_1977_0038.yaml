tldr: The study investigates the convective stability of a rotating spherical fluid
  shell with non-uniform heating. The analysis focuses on the effects of heat escaping
  from the interior and the influence of an initial shear flow on the fluid's stability.
  Numerical results are presented for two fluid shell thicknesses, demonstrating the
  impact of the initial flow on the system's behavior.
