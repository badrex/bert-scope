tldr: The authors discuss the potential risks of using sewage sludge as a fertilizer,
  which can lead to increased levels of heavy metals in the soil. They highlight the
  dangers of these enhanced levels of metals, such as lead and cadmium, to both plant
  growth and human health. The authors suggest that more research is needed to determine
  the long-term consequences of this contamination and to develop safer methods for
  managing and disposing of metal-rich waste materials.
