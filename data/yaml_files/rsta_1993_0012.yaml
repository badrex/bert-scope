tldr: Seismic observations reveal low-velocity zones beneath active arc volcanoes
  in northeastern Japan, indicating the presence of magma in the Earth's crust and
  upper mantle. These findings provide insights into the deep structure and magma
  movement beneath volcanic arcs, contributing to a better understanding of arc volcanism.
