tldr: This article discusses the role of stable complexes in repressing and activating
  eukaryotic genes. The author describes the characteristics and composition of these
  complexes and how they maintain the activity or repression of 5S RNA genes. The
  study focuses on understanding the molecular basis of gene control in Xenopus, using
  transcription experiments and chromatin analysis.
