tldr: The authors studied the catalytic actions at solid surfaces, specifically the
  transference of hydrogen from saturated to unsaturated organic compounds in the
  liquid state in the presence of metallic nickel. They discovered that hydrogenation
  and dehydrogenation can occur simultaneously, and the process can be explained by
  the formation of an intermediate system involving the organic compounds, nickel,
  and hydrogen. This research has implications for understanding the behavior of catalysts
  and the reactions they facilitate.
