tldr: The authors applied the molecular orbital method to study the wave functions
  of lithium atoms. They used both Hartree and Fock approximations to calculate the
  energy and analyzed the changes in screening constants in passing from atomic to
  molecular states. The study provides a guide to the accuracy of molecular orbital
  methods for more complex molecules and emphasizes the importance of orthogonality
  in discussing electron exchange.
