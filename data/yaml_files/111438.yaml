tldr: The author examines various methods for detecting and discriminating between
  different cinchona alkaloids, such as quinine, quinidin, and quinicine, and their
  salts. They focus on the optical properties of these alkaloids, including fluorescence
  and molecular rotations, and propose new methods for their detection based on the
  production of iodo-sulfates. The author also critically evaluates existing tests
  for these alkaloids and their salts, highlighting their limitations and potential
  improvements.
