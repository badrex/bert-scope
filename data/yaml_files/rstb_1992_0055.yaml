tldr: The author investigates the role of cholinergic interneurons in the feeding
  system of the pond snail Lymnaea stagnalis. They use pharmacological dissection
  to study the effects of cholinergic antagonists on the feeding rhythm. The results
  support the model of the feeding pattern generator, including recurrent inhibition,
  and suggest that cholinergic interneurons play a crucial role in the feeding system.
