tldr: 'This study investigates the crack-blunting mechanisms in impact tests on three
  different polymers: high-density polyethylene (HDPE), polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE),
  and polymethylmethacrylate (PMMA). The authors found that the fracture toughness
  of these polymers is highly dependent on the strain rate and temperature. They propose
  a thermal diffusion-controlled process as the most likely cause of the observed
  rate dependence, which leads to crack-tip blunting and increased fracture toughness.'
