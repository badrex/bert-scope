tldr: The authors conducted experiments on dogs to study the early degenerative changes
  in sensory end organs of muscles. They observed that degeneration occurred first
  in the part of the neuron most remote from the cell and found that the spiral nerve
  termination in the muscle spindle showed changes within 24 hours after sectioning
  the nerve. The research showed that the spiral nerve termination surrounds a fine
  muscle fiber with large, clear, non-nucleated cells in the center. The findings
  also indicated that no fatty changes were demonstrated in the intramuscular cells
  similar to those found in the case of tabes dorsalis in humans.
