tldr: This study investigates the weak chemiluminescence effects produced by the thermal
  decomposition of organic hydroperoxides in solution. Two types of emissions, a red
  form with a longer wavelength and a blue form from the liquid volume, are observed.
  The authors discuss the possible light-emitting processes and suggest that the red
  emission may be due to the catalytic decomposition of hydroperoxide, while the blue
  emission comes from a newly formed fluorescent product molecule.
