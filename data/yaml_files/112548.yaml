tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, discovered a new compound of strychnine and persulfide
  of hydrogen. This compound is insoluble in water, alcohol, and ether, and sheds
  light on the composition of persulfide of hydrogen. The formation of this compound
  could potentially be used for preparing strychnine and separating it from other
  substances.
