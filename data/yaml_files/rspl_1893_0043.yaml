tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the flow of electric currents and
  energy dissipation in circuits with measurable inductance and capacitance. They
  discovered that energy dissipation occurs not only in the wire circuit but also
  in the dielectric of the capacitor. The results showed that the critical discharge
  and oscillatory behavior of the circuits can be influenced by the resistance and
  inductance values.
