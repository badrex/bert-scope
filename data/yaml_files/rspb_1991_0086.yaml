tldr: 'The authors present a covalent switching mechanism for electron transfer in
  cytochromes P-450, explaining how the sulfur atom of cysteine-357 insulates itself
  from the highly oxidizing heme-iron. This mechanism involves two distinct steps:
  spin unpairing and heterolysis, and has implications for understanding protein-protein
  interactions and the role of cysteine and aromatic residues in electron-transport
  mechanisms.'
