tldr: This article discusses the advancements and challenges in the study of the middle
  atmosphere through rocket photometry, focusing on the oxygen-related nightglow.
  The authors describe experimental aspects of rocket photometry, the development
  of understanding of the excitation mechanisms and associated photochemistry, and
  the use of various techniques to obtain accurate attitude information and differentiate
  measured integrated data to obtain emission profiles. The study of the OI Green
  Line at 557.7 nm and the Atmospheric Bands is also explored, highlighting the progress
  made in understanding their excitation mechanisms and the role of rocket photometry
  in this field.
