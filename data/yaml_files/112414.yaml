tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted spectroscopic observations of the Sun
  and discovered that the solar spectrum contains the spectrum of hydrogen. He also
  found that the chromosphere and prominences are composed of hydrogen and other elements
  like sodium, magnesium, and barium. The study of the solar spectrum and its lines
  provided insights into the physical constitution and pressures of the outer limits
  of the solar atmosphere.
