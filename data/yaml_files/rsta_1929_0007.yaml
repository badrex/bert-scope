tldr: This article investigates the streamlines and stability of Kármán streets of
  vortices in a channel of finite breadth, considering both unsymmetrical and symmetrical
  double rows. The study focuses on the effect of plane barriers on the motion and
  stability of these systems, which is important for understanding two-dimensional
  turbulent flow between parallel plane barriers.
