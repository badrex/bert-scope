tldr: This article investigates the shearing and dilatation of dry sand, focusing
  on the internal stress, dilatation, and shear rate. The author applies previous
  findings from experiments with uniform spheres in water to predict the frequency
  of the booming sound emitted by certain desert dunes. The study has implications
  for understanding sand movement and the sounds produced by natural sands.
