tldr: This study investigates the docking maneuver of ethidium and its carboxylated
  derivative at the DNA receptor using quantum mechanical methods. The research aims
  to determine if the drug molecules are pre-aligned for effective docking or if the
  receptor induces the ligand orientation. The molecular electrostatic potential surrounding
  the receptor is mapped, and the orientation of the drug molecules is studied in
  a simplified anionic field. The results show that the receptor induces an orientation
  in the approaching ligand, and the energy involved in modifying the alignment is
  attributed to electrostatic interactions and induced electron delocalization.
