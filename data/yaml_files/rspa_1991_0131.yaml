tldr: The authors used a specially designed cryogenic experimental system to irradiate
  copper and molybdenum single crystals with low-energy heavy ions at 4.2 and 78 K.
  They produced populations of dislocation loops near the irradiated surface and measured
  their depth distributions using a transmission electron microscope. The results
  showed that only a small fraction of point defects created during irradiation were
  retained in visible loops after warming to room temperature. The findings suggest
  that loop depth distributions are determined by the fraction of incident ions channeled
  at the irradiated surface rather than surface orientation effects.
