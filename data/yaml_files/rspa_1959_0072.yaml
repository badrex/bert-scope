tldr: The author investigates the reaction of methylene with isobutene when the methylene
  is in a vibrationally excited state. They find that the methylene can have excess
  energy, which leads to different reactions. The results show that the excited methylene
  reacts with isobutene to form 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane, which can isomerize into
  other products. The study provides insights into the reactivity of methylene and
  the role of energy in chemical reactions.
