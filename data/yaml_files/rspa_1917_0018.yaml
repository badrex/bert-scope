tldr: The authors conducted experiments with copper ferrocyanide membranes to study
  their selective properties. They found that the membranes are composed of colloidal
  particles of copper ferrocyanide hydrate, which selectively adsorb water from sugar
  solutions. This selective adsorption is responsible for the membrane's permeability
  and osmotic flow. The results support the adsorption hypothesis and provide insights
  into the behavior of colloidal membranes.
