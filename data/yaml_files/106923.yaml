tldr: The author, John Haighton, conducted a series of experiments to study animal
  impregnation and the formation of corpora lutea. He examined the ovaries of virgin
  rabbits and observed the changes that occurred during impregnation. Haighton discovered
  that the formation of corpora lutea is a reliable indicator of impregnation, as
  they form after the male's fecundating fluid affects the female's ovaries. This
  research helped to clarify the process of impregnation and the role of corpora lutea
  in animal reproduction.
