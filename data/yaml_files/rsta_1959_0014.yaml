revised_title: 'Reflexion Levels and Coupling Regions in a Horizontally Stratified
  Ionosphere: Oblique Incidence'

tldr: This article investigates the levels in a horizontally stratified ionosphere
  where coupling between characteristic waves becomes infinite, leading to critical
  coupling and breakdown of ray-theory approximations. The study extends the problem
  of coupling to include oblique incidence, using the Booker quartic to analyze propagation
  in the ionosphere. The article focuses on determining the conditions under which
  the two roots of the quartic are equal and finding the levels in the ionosphere
  where reflexion occurs.
