tldr: Researchers investigated whether pigeons rely on magnetic information to navigate
  home. They found that pigeons transported in altered magnetic fields or darkness
  displayed disturbances in initial orientation, but when given a tranquillizer, their
  orientation was similar to untreated controls. This suggests that pigeons do not
  rely on magnetic information picked up en route for homing, and the disturbances
  in orientation may be due to emotional stress caused by the transportation methods.
