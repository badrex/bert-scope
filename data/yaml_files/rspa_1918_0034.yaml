tldr: This study investigates the lunar and solar diurnal variations of water-level
  in a well at Kew Observatory. The authors found that the well responded to the lunar
  fortnightly oscillation of the nearby River Thames and observed well-marked solar
  and lunar diurnal variations in water-level. They also determined the time taken
  for solar and lunar semi-diurnal tides to travel through the subsoil from the river
  to the well.
