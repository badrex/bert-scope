tldr: The author investigates the effects of sub-zero temperatures on rat superior
  cervical ganglia and the protective influence of glycerol. They find that freezing
  below -15°C destroys the ganglion's function, but after treating with glycerol,
  the ganglion can withstand cooling to -76°C and recover normal responses to electrical
  stimulation. The study shows the potential for glycerol to protect mammalian cells
  and tissues during freezing.
