tldr: The authors studied the development of undifferentiated limb-buds of embryonic
  fowls when grafted subcutaneously into post-embryonic chicks and when cultivated
  in vitro. They observed that the limb-buds showed organotypic growth and underwent
  differentiation along normal lines. This research provides insights into the behavior
  of embryonic tissues in abnormal environments and contributes to the understanding
  of tissue differentiation and growth.
