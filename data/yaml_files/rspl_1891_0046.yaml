tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrolysis of silver nitrate
  in a vacuum and found that the deposits of silver were slightly larger when the
  electrolysis was conducted in vacuo than when exposed to air at the ordinary pressure.
  They discovered that the dissolved oxygen in the air caused the difference in the
  deposits, and this finding helped to improve the accuracy of the silver voltameter.
