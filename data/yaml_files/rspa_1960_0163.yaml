tldr: The authors discuss the electromagnetic field and stress in the de Sitter universe.
  They analyze the field equations and show that a negative pressure is associated
  with the required rate of creation. The electromagnetic field due to charge inequality
  supplies a reason for this stress. The authors identify this stress with the one
  given by the de Sitter metric, which leads to a negative value.
