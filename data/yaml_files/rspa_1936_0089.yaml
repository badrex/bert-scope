tldr: The authors studied the emission spectrum of bismuth fluoride (BiF) and conducted
  a vibrational analysis of its spectrum. They found that the emitting molecule is
  diatomic and has a Condon parabola typical of fluoride bands. The authors also discussed
  dissociation energies and the possibility of excited bismuth being involved in the
  dissociation process.
