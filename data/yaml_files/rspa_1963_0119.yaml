tldr: The authors measured isotope shifts in the resonance line of the arc spectrum
  of barium by comparing the wavelengths of lines emitted by enriched isotopes. They
  found that the shifts for certain isotopes were in agreement with previous findings,
  while others showed discrepancies that could be explained by insufficient blending
  of hyperfine structure components. The study provides a better understanding of
  the atomic structure and properties of barium isotopes.
