tldr: This study investigates short-period fluctuations in the numbers of bacterial
  cells in soil using the microscope ratio method and plate count method. The research
  found significant changes in bacterial numbers over time, with a large drop followed
  by a subsequent increase. The total count method revealed higher numbers than the
  plate count method, suggesting that plate counts may underestimate the total number
  of bacteria in soil.
