tldr: The author examines two cranial casts of the Archaeoceti sub-order, Zeuglodon,
  and finds that their brain structure is significantly different from modern cetaceans.
  The brain has a reptilian-like appearance with a small cerebrum and a large cerebellum.
  The author discusses the factors that may have influenced the brain's size and structure,
  such as the aquatic lifestyle and the evolutionary history of the Archaeoceti and
  Cetacea.
