tldr: The author, John Douglas, proposes a new surgical method to help patients with
  bladder stones who cannot undergo traditional surgeries. He suggests creating an
  artificial fistula in the perineum to allow patients to pass a probe to push the
  stone back or to inject cleansing liquids. This method can also help prevent the
  growth of new stones and alleviate pain. Douglas believes that this approach can
  be further improved by dilating the fistula to allow the use of forceps to extract
  the stone gradually.
