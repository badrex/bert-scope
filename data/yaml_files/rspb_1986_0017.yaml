tldr: This study examines the phylogeny and evolutionary rates of the Partula snails
  from the Society Islands using electrophoretic analysis of allozymes. The results
  suggest that the radiation of Partula in the Society Islands can be explained by
  a single colonization of each island. The average rate of allozymic divergence is
  estimated to be 0.126 per million years, with a threefold variation in rates within
  Partula. The findings challenge the idea that geographical isolation and multiple
  colonizations play significant roles in the radiation of other animals in archipelagos.
