tldr: The authors study the vibration frequencies and structure of polyatomic molecules,
  specifically focusing on alkyl radicals. They explore different methods for calculating
  these frequencies and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding
  molecular structure and reactions. The research also provides insights into the
  potential energy functions of molecules and the force constants involved in their
  vibrations.
