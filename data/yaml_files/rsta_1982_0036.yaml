tldr: This article examines the role of lithospheric flexure in the formation of sedimentary
  basins. The authors apply different sedimentary loads to elastic and viscoelastic
  models to calculate the stratigraphy and gravity anomalies of basins. They compare
  the results with observations to determine the best-fitting flexural model, which
  has implications for studies of the rheology of continental lithosphere, tectonic
  subsidence of basins, and variations in sea level through time.
