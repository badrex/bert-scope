tldr: The author discusses the concept of bacterial sexuality and the role of the
  sex factor in bacterial conjugation. They describe the process of conjugation in
  Escherichia coli, where the sex factor is transferred from male to female bacteria,
  converting them into males and allowing for the transmission of the sex factor to
  other females. This process is infectious and efficient, and the sex factor can
  be transferred between different bacterial species, making it a unique and fascinating
  aspect of bacterial behavior.
