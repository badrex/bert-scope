tldr: In this letter, Martin Lister discusses his observations of vegetable excrescencies
  and the insects that develop within them. He examines various types of excrescencies
  and their relationship with insects, questioning whether they are generated by the
  plants themselves or by the insects. Lister also explores different ways insects
  feed on plants and the role of insects in plant reproduction.
