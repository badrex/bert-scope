tldr: Researchers have developed a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay to identify
  and track female chromosomes in cockerel ejaculates. This technique allows them
  to study the fate of female cells in male germline chimaeras and understand the
  process of sex determination in birds. The PCR assay amplifies a specific region
  of the W chromosome, enabling the detection of female DNA in male samples.
