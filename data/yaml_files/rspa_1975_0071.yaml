tldr: This study investigates the low temperature specific heats of zinc alloyed with
  silver, focusing on the electronic specific heat coefficient and limiting Debye
  temperature. The results show a decreasing trend in the density of states at the
  Fermi level when silver is added to zinc, contrary to predictions based on a rigid
  band approach. This indicates a breakdown of the rigid band condition on alloying,
  likely due to the influence of band electrons or charge distribution effects between
  solute and solvent atoms.
