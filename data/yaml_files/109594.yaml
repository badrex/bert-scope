tldr: This article by Thomas Young explores the phenomena of capillary action and
  cohesion of fluids. He explains the equable tension of fluid surfaces and how it
  can be used to determine the elevation or depression of fluids. Young also discusses
  the adhesion of fluids to solids and the hydrostatic actions of fluid elevations
  and depressions. The study provides a better understanding of the attractions and
  repulsions of floating bodies and the cohesion between moistened surfaces.
