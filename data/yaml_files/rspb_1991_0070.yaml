tldr: The author developed a new method to analyze the dynamic properties of oxidative
  phosphorylation, focusing on the sensitivity of the phosphate potential to fluctuating
  cellular ATP utilization. Using eigenvalue sensitivity analysis, the study revealed
  that oxidative phosphorylation has minimal sensitivity and highest buffering capacity
  at a specific degree of coupling, which aligns with the optimal efficiency of ATP
  production in living cells.
