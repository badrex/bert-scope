tldr: Dirac proposed a new idea that led to the discovery of antiparticles, specifically
  the anti-electron, which has a positive charge and the same mass as an electron.
  This idea also revealed a symmetry between electricity and magnetism, showing that
  the smallest electric charge is connected to the smallest magnetic pole. The theory
  predicts a connection between the smallest electric charge and the smallest magnetic
  pole, which has not been fully explored but could lead to a better understanding
  of the fundamental nature of matter and energy.
