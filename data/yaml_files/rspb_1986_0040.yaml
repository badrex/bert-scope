tldr: The study investigates the morphology and terminations of photoreceptor axons
  in the compound eye of the desert ant, Cataglyphis bicolor. The researchers discovered
  a new type of receptor axon, R9, which terminates in the proximal layer of the lamina.
  They also found that the regional specialization of the retina, such as the dorsal
  rim area, dorsal retina, and ventral retina, is reflected in the morphology of receptor
  terminals and second-order neurons. This research provides insights into the neural
  connections and visual processing in the desert ant's compound eye.
