tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted on unannealed glass vessels, which
  are extremely fragile and break easily. The author, M. Allamand, explores the factors
  that cause these glasses to break, such as the weight and type of objects dropped
  into them. He also notes that the thickness of the glass bottom affects its fragility.
  The article highlights the unique properties of unannealed glass and the importance
  of annealing in making glass vessels more durable.
