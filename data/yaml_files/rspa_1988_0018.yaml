tldr: This article discusses the computation and design of a table of complementary
  pairs of set partitions, focusing on the connections between partitions and cumulants
  in statistics. The authors introduce partitions of numbers and sets, and explain
  the natural orderings and notations used to describe them. They also explore the
  concept of connectedness between pairs of set partitions and the compression of
  the table, making it more concise and useful for practical applications.
