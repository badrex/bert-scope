tldr: This article describes the development of a new spectrometer for studying molecular
  structure in the infra-red spectrum. The authors use a combination of a grating
  and a rock salt prism to analyze the radiation and provide a detailed explanation
  of the apparatus and technique used in their experiments. The spectrometer is designed
  to deal with small separations in the fine structure, allowing for the study of
  triatomic molecules and the application of the newer quantum theory.
