tldr: This article discusses the origin and formation of chert beds in the upper Carboniferous
  limestones of Ireland. The author suggests that chert beds are formed due to the
  replacement of the original limestone by silica, which occurs when the limestone
  is exposed to warm, shallow seas rich in silica. The presence of marine life, such
  as corals, crinoids, and foraminifera, supports this theory, as their shells or
  skeletons are made of carbonate of lime rather than silica. The author also provides
  chemical analyses and photographic figures of thin slices of chert to support their
  findings.
