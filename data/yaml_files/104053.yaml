tldr: The article describes the water-works at London Bridge, which used tidal power
  to lift water to a specific height. The system consisted of large wheels powered
  by the tide, which raised and lowered four sets of forcing rods and cylinders to
  pump water. The author suggests improvements to the design, such as increasing the
  stroke length and enlarging the pipes to reduce losses and increase efficiency.
