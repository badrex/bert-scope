tldr: The authors studied the thermoluminescence of irradiated polyethylene and other
  polymers, observing glow curves and analyzing the effects of irradiation, temperature,
  and oxygen on the materials. They found that polyethylene exhibited the most distinctive
  thermoluminescence behavior, with three peaks in the glow curve in the absence of
  oxygen. The authors also discussed the experimental methods used to produce and
  analyze the glow curves.
