tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the functions of the cerebral
  cortex and the localization of centers for voluntary action and sensation. They
  used electrical stimulation and surgical removal of specific brain regions to understand
  the effects on motor and sensory functions. The results showed that the prefrontal
  region was not essential for motor control, contrary to previous findings, and emphasized
  the importance of antiseptic precautions during brain surgery.
