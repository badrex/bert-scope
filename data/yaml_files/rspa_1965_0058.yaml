tldr: The authors introduce a new technique for studying asymptotic behavior in special
  and general relativity, focusing on zero rest-mass fields. They discuss the peeling-off
  property of principal null directions associated with these fields and explore its
  implications for radiation fields and asymptotic space-times. The technique is applicable
  to various fields, including the gravitational, electromagnetic, and neutrino fields.
