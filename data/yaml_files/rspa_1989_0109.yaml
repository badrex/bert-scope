tldr: The article explores the concept of finitely presented functors and provides
  a characterization of these functors using Auslander and Reiten's theorem. It also
  introduces a new category and discusses properties of finitely presented functors,
  such as monomorphisms and epimorphisms, and their relation to injective and projective
  functors.
