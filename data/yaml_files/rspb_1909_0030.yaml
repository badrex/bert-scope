tldr: In 1909, a team of researchers discovered a new parasite species, Trypanosoma
  ingens, in the blood of a reed-buck in Uganda. This large parasite, named after
  Virgil's Cyclops, is related to the Trypanosoma genus and has a slow, deliberate
  movement. The researchers are working to identify the carrier of the parasite and
  its impact on local wildlife and cattle.
