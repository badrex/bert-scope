  Monoxide and Hydrogen on Nickel Catalysts

tldr: The authors studied the interaction of carbon monoxide and hydrogen on nickel
  catalysts at relatively low temperatures. They discovered a new action that produces
  methane, which has important practical implications for producing pure methane or
  enriching town's gas in methane. This method results in a higher yield of methane
  compared to other methods.
