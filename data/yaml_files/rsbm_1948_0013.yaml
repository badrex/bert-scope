tldr: Arthur William Rogers was a prominent geologist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of South African geology. He worked extensively in the Cape
  Province and Transvaal, mapping key formations and discovering ancient glacial formations.
  Rogers also played a crucial role in the Union Geological Survey and the mapping
  of the Witwatersrand Beds. His work in the Kalahari and with the Vernay-Lang expedition
  further expanded his knowledge of the region's geology. In his later years, he focused
  on diatoms and their distribution, hoping to provide evidence for climatic changes
  during the later Tertiary and Quaternary periods.
