tldr: This study investigates the transport of rat and bovine IgG and ferritin across
  the small intestine segments of suckling rats. The most active transport occurs
  in the ileum, with both proteins being taken up by the cells and released into the
  carcase. The results show that the small intestine of suckling rats is selective
  in transporting proteins, with the duodenum having a slightly higher selectivity
  ratio compared to the ileum and jejunum.
