tldr: This article discusses the thermonuclear reactions and plasma conditions in
  stellar interiors, explaining how they provide the main source of radiated energy
  for stars and produce heavy elements in the Universe. It also explores the potential
  of neutrino detection to study the interior of stars and the challenges involved
  in detecting them.
