tldr: This article explores the regeneration of the nervous system in adult mammals,
  focusing on the responses of injured neurons in the central nervous system. The
  authors discuss experimental manipulations that enhance neuronal survival and axonal
  regeneration, leading to the restoration of functional connections. They also examine
  the role of the non-neuronal environment in the success of axonal regeneration and
  the molecular events that influence interactions between axonal growth cones and
  their non-neuronal substrates.
