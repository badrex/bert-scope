tldr: The author, Samuel Cruwys, describes an Aurora Borealis event observed in Devonshire.
  The phenomenon consisted of a bright, expanding body of lucid vapor, with streaming
  lights of various colors and shapes. The event lasted for about 25 minutes, after
  which dark clouds and a snowstorm followed. This phenomenon is now known as the
  Northern Lights and is caused by charged particles from the sun interacting with
  Earth's magnetic field.
