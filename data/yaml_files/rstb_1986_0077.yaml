tldr: The authors propose a palaeoecological solution to the biogeographic problem
  of the North Atlantic islands' flora and fauna. They suggest that the islands lost
  most of their biota during the height of the glacial periods and were invaded and
  colonized mainly from northwest Europe during the short interglacial phases. The
  authors also explain the differences in endemic species between islands based on
  their distance from major glacial influences. This hypothesis is supported by the
  analysis of carabid beetle faunas and the study of Quaternary events and the flora
  and fauna of the region.
