tldr: The authors conducted a study on the anatomy and physiology of the bird's nervous
  system, focusing on the tracts and cell groups within the brain. They discovered
  the main tracts, including the tractus septomesencephalicus, and described their
  connections and functions. The study also discussed the visual importance of birds,
  as well as the differences in the olfactory lobes and cerebral hemispheres. The
  authors used various staining methods and techniques to analyze the brain's structure
  and function, providing valuable insights into the bird's nervous system.
