tldr: The study examines the variation in the architecture of the multiple-bank retina
  in the deep-sea teleost, Chauliodus sloani, as the fish grows. It finds that as
  the fish grows, new banks of rods are added to the retina, increasing the density
  of rods and nuclei in the outer nuclear layer. The study also discusses the implications
  of these findings for the development and function of the multiple-bank retina in
  deep-sea species.
