tldr: The authors present a new theory of algebraic functions of one variable, focusing
  on the Complementary Theorem, which is more general than the Riemann-Roch Theorem.
  They discuss the representation of rational functions, the concept of adjoint orders
  of coincidence, and the principal coefficient of a function. The theory is applicable
  to algebraic geometry and complex analysis.
