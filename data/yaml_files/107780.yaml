tldr: The author addresses objections raised against the geometrical representation
  of square roots of negative quantities, arguing that they are not merely signs of
  impossibility and that there is a connection between algebra and geometry. The author
  provides examples and explanations to support their claims, emphasizing the importance
  of understanding these concepts for mathematicians.
