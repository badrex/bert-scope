tldr: This study investigates the genetics of warning coloration in Peruvian hybrid
  zones of Heliconius erato and H. melpomene. The research focuses on understanding
  the genetic system controlling color patterns in these species and how it contributes
  to speciation. The findings reveal that the genetic system is strongly epistatic,
  with hybrid offspring having "fuzzier" and more variable patterns than pure races.
  The study provides insights into the evolution of warning coloration and its role
  in speciation.
