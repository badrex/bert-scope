tldr: The author conducted experiments to test the theory of pluri-segmental innervation
  of muscle fibres. They measured both tension and heat produced during muscle contractions
  when stimulating different nerve roots separately and together. The results showed
  that the sum of the tensions developed was higher than when stimulating all roots
  at once, confirming previous findings. However, the sum of the heats produced was
  almost equal to the heat obtained by stimulating all components together, suggesting
  that the previous findings might be due to the minute structure of the muscle rather
  than pluri-segmental innervation.
