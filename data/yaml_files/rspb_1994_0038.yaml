revised_title: Statistical Inference for a Two-State Markov Model of Ion Channel Gating

tldr: The authors present a method for constructing confidence sets for a two-state
  Markov model of ion channel gating when time interval omission is incorporated.
  They also introduce a new method to overcome non-identifiability issues based on
  a single ion channel record. This study is essential for understanding receptor-channel
  gating mechanisms and estimating transition rates in ion channels.
