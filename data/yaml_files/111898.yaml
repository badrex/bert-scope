tldr: 'The author, Thomas Graham, discusses the concept of liquid diffusion and its
  applications in separating and analyzing different substances. He distinguishes
  between two classes of substances: crystalloids, which are highly diffusive and
  tend to crystallize, and colloids, which have low diffusibility, are typically found
  in animal and plant tissues, and form a gelatinous structure. Graham also explains
  the use of dialysis, a technique that uses a semipermeable membrane to separate
  colloids and crystalloids, and its applications in purifying various substances.'
