tldr: Sir William Crookes and Professor James Dewar conducted experiments to study
  the effects of extreme cold on radium emanations. They found that the scintillations
  produced by radium on a sensitive blende screen became fainter when cooled with
  liquid air but became brighter when the screen was cooled while the radium salt
  was at the ordinary temperature. The experiments showed that the highest vacuum
  that can be obtained by the action of cold does not diminish the scintillations.
  The authors also observed the activity of radium in rendering air electrically conductive
  and the luminosity of the radium salt in liquid hydrogen.
