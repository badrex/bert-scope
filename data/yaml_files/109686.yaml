tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, investigates the identity of columbium and
  tantalum by analyzing their properties and comparing them to Swedish and American
  mineral samples. He finds that both minerals contain the same metal, despite differences
  in their specific gravities. The white oxide obtained from each mineral has the
  same properties, such as solubility in potash and insolubility in various acids.
