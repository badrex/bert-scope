tldr: The authors present a set of generators for the center of the integral group
  ring of a symmetric group. They construct a ring with the symmetric group as a homomorphic
  image and use this to prove a theorem that yields a proof within substitutional
  analysis of Nakayama's criterion for two representations of a group to belong to
  the same block. This work contributes to the understanding of group and ring theory,
  specifically in the context of symmetric groups and their properties.
