tldr: This article presents a quantum theory of interacting particles with rigorous
  Lorentz covariance and conservation laws. The author develops a method to deal with
  the difficulties associated with point interactions, leading to a theory without
  infinite renormalization and allowing for a legitimate physical interpretation after
  applying supplementary conditions.
