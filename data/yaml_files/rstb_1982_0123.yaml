tldr: This article explores the molecular biology of cell locomotion, specifically
  the interactions between fibroblasts and their substratum. The authors found that
  both endogenous and exogenous fibronectins play a role in cell-substratum interactions,
  including adhesion, spreading, and the export of matrix materials. They also discovered
  that fibronectin-bearing structures can lead to the formation of adhesions, stable
  anchorage, or intercellular junctions, depending on other cellular control mechanisms.
  The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of fibroblast adhesion and their
  roles in cellular functions.
