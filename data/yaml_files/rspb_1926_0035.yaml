tldr: The author discusses the common principles underlying various forms of animal
  movement and muscle function. They explore how different types of muscles, from
  cross-striated to smooth muscles, share similar mechanisms and molecular organization.
  The author also examines the role of oxygen in muscle function and the transformation
  of chemical energy into mechanical energy, highlighting the importance of understanding
  these processes in the broader context of biology and life sciences.
