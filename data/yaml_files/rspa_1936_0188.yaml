tldr: The authors conducted a study on the optical rotatory power and molecular constitution
  of steroids. They found that the configuration of certain carbon atoms and groups
  in the steroid molecules has a significant impact on their optical properties. The
  study also explored the concept of induced dissymmetry, where unsaturated linkages
  close to an asymmetric carbon atom can cause a change in optical activity. This
  research provides a better understanding of the relationship between the molecular
  structure and optical properties of steroids.
