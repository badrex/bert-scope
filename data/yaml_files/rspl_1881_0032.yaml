tldr: The author examines the forms of pendent liquid drops and develops a method
  to determine the value of surface tension. By projecting a magnified image of the
  drops and tracing their outlines, the author studies the relationship between the
  drop's size, shape, and surface tension, providing insights into the physical properties
  of liquids and their behavior.
