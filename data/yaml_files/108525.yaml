tldr: This article provides a detailed analysis of the Megatherium, a giant prehistoric
  ground sloth, focusing on its skeletal structure, affinities to other species, and
  its classification within the Edentata family. The author examines various studies
  and theories about the Megatherium's habits, comparing its bones to those of existing
  species to determine its relationships and affinities. The article also discusses
  the discovery of additional bones and the bony armor found with the Megatherium,
  which supports the theory that it was related to armadillos.
