tldr: The authors introduce a new method of gas chromatography called sorption-effect
  chromatography, which is an absolute method that can determine the molar composition
  of a sample without the need for calibration. This technique measures the volumetric
  flow rate of the stream leaving a chromatographic column, allowing for a more accurate
  analysis of the sample. The authors describe the theoretical development, design,
  and a severe experimental test of the method, highlighting its advantages over conventional
  gas chromatography.
