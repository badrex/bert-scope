tldr: This article describes a radioimmunoassay technique capable of detecting small
  amounts of proteins in fossils, such as collagen and albumin. The authors successfully
  identified species-specific proteins in a frozen mammoth, a Pleistocene bison, and
  various human fossils, including Neanderthal, Homo erectus, and Australopithecus
  robustus. This method promises to provide molecular data on the genetic affinities
  of fossil and living species, potentially clarifying evolutionary relationships
  and disputes.
