tldr: This study investigates the thermochemistry of reductions caused by lithium
  aluminum hydride, focusing on the C-I bond dissociation energy in CH3I. The authors
  found that the reaction follows a step-wise path, with the first atom being much
  more reactive than the remaining three. They also discovered that when lithium aluminum
  hydride is present in considerable excess, methyl iodide is rapidly and completely
  reduced. The authors hope to extend these studies to other organic halogen compounds
  to derive bond dissociation energies in general.
