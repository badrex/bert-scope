tldr: This article presents an abridged state of the weather in London for the year
  1775, collected from the Meteorological Journal of the Royal Society. It provides
  a detailed analysis of wind frequency, rainfall, and temperature, revealing that
  the South West winds were the most frequent, and the autumn was the wettest quarter.
  The study also examines the influence of the Moon on weather changes and discusses
  the relationship between wind direction and barometric pressure.
