tldr: The author studied organic deposits at Colney Heath, Herts, to understand the
  late-Weichselian conditions in south-eastern Britain. They found a diverse range
  of plant life, including arctic birch, dwarf willows, and various dry-land plants.
  The plant evidence, along with animal remains, suggests that the late-Weichselian
  vegetation was without woodland, and the region experienced temporary and local
  changes in climate during the later part of the last glaciation.
