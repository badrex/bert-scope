tldr: This article discusses an experiment where an external magnetic field causes
  instability in the laminar flow of mercury. The magnetic field introduces electric
  currents, modifying the state of motion and creating an electrodynamic force. The
  result is the formation of vortex rows in the presence of the magnetic field, with
  the number of vortices increasing with the magnetic field strength.
