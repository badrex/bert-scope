tldr: This article investigates the effect of the image force on the emission and
  reflexion of electrons by metals. The authors calculate the emission and reflexion
  coefficients for electrons at the metal surface and integrate over all incident
  electrons. They find that the emission coefficient for thermions becomes nearly
  equal to 1, and the average reflexion amounts to a few percent. The authors also
  discuss the influence of external fields on electron emission and reflexion.
