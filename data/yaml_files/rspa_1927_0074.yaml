tldr: This article investigates the emission of electrons from metallic drops in the
  presence of a gaseous chemical reagent and explores the effects of varying gas pressures
  and liquid alloy compositions. The authors discovered that electron emission increases
  with the number of drops and is independent of gas pressure within a certain range.
  They also found that the emitted electrons have a higher temperature than previously
  observed, suggesting a new understanding of electron emission processes.
