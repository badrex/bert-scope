tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of normal paraffin hydrocarbons
  and their activation energies. The authors found that the activation energy for
  the fully inhibited reaction with pentane and heptane increases as the pressure
  decreases, while ethane and propane show little variation in activation energy with
  pressure. The results provide insights into the molecular reactions and mechanisms
  involved in the decomposition process.
