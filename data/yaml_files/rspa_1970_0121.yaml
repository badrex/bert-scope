tldr: The authors develop a one-body potential theory that takes into account exchange
  and correlation forces to calculate the electronic contribution to the dynamical
  matrix in lattice dynamics. They show that their theory can be used to evaluate
  deviations from the rigid-ion model, which is important for understanding many-body
  forces in lattice dynamics.
