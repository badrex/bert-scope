tldr: The authors studied the mobility of alkali ions in water vapour and found that
  the mobility decreases slightly with increasing mass of the alkali atom at low field-pressure
  values. However, the sequence changes entirely when the field-pressure is significantly
  increased. The results are explained by the gradual breakup of the cluster of molecules
  attached to the ion as its kinetic energy increases, depending on the energy of
  dissociation of a water molecule from an alkali ion and the change in the ion's
  mass due to the loss of a water molecule from the cluster.
