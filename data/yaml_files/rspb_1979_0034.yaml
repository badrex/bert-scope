tldr: The study investigates the functional specialization and binocular interaction
  in the visual areas of the rhesus monkey prestriate cortex. It uses anatomical and
  electrophysiological techniques to define the boundaries of these areas and explores
  the neural mechanisms involved in stereopsis. The research reveals that most cells
  in the prestriate areas are binocularly driven, and the degree of binocular interaction
  varies from cell to cell. The study also identifies at least six areas within the
  prestriate cortex and discusses their potential roles in stereoscopic vision.
