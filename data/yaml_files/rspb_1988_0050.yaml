tldr: The article presents a new approach to modeling microcirculatory transport and
  exchange in skeletal muscle. The authors introduce a mathematical theory that combines
  information on capillary morphology with an understanding of capillary-tissue exchange
  and convection and diffusion through the tissue. The objective is to describe the
  large-scale interaction of numerous capillary groups and interpret phenomena observed
  in a whole organ in terms of processes occurring within individual capillaries.
  The study focuses on fluid exchange, small metabolite transport, and oxygen transport
  to tissue.
