tldr: This article discusses the dynamics of wave propagation and wave transport in
  the middle atmosphere, focusing on vertically propagating, forced, planetary scale
  waves. It explores extratropical planetary waves and equatorial waves, their interaction
  with the mean flow, and their role in maintaining the zonal mean momentum and temperature
  budgets, as well as the ozone budget. The article also explains the importance of
  wave transience and wave damping in these processes.
