tldr: This article examines the potential solar influence on the African monsoon and
  rainfall patterns. It explores various areas of Africa where solar signals may be
  present and discusses the mechanisms behind these effects. The authors propose that
  changes in solar activity, particularly in its corpuscular and electromagnetic aspects,
  can impact global climate through interactions between the low ionosphere and high
  troposphere. This can lead to either a 'cold global situation' with more frequent
  droughts or a 'warm global situation' with a more expansive monsoon.
