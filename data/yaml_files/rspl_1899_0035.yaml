tldr: The author investigated the orientation of Greek temples, particularly focusing
  on the Cabeirion Temple and two Athenian temples, the Theseum and the Erechtheum.
  They discovered that the orientation of these temples was connected to important
  Athenian festivals and the Metonic cycle. This study helped confirm the traditional
  names and dates of dedication for these temples.
