tldr: The author describes experiments conducted on the spinal cord and cortex to
  simulate epileptic seizures. They observed electromotive changes in the cord, which
  resulted in persistent (tonic) and rhythmical (clonic) effects. These findings provide
  insights into the nature of epileptic fits and the underlying physiological processes.
