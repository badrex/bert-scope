tldr: This article discusses the methods used in British Colonial Magnetic Observatories
  to determine the absolute values, secular change, and annual variation of the magnetic
  force. The author, Edward Sabine, presents the results of observations at Toronto
  and Hobarton, showing that the magnetic needle approaches the vertical position
  more in the winter months and that the total force is greatest during these months.
  The author calls for further research and observations to confirm these findings
  and understand the underlying causes of the annual variation.
