tldr: The study investigates the unique clear-zone compound eye of the night-flying
  scarabaeid beetle, Anoplognathus. The eye has a short corneal cone and a crystalline
  cone that partially focuses light across the wide clear zone in the dark-adapted
  state. The eye's anatomy and function are analyzed using various methods, revealing
  its poor acuity but increased sensitivity to large objects. This research provides
  insight into the variety of optical and physiological adaptations in insect eyes.
