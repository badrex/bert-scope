tldr: The article discusses the concept of canards, which are false bifurcations in
  oscillatory systems where the amplitude changes dramatically while the qualitative
  features remain the same. Canards are found in fast-slow dynamical systems and are
  related to the stable and unstable manifolds of the phase plane. The author presents
  a new approach to characterize canards using the inflection line, which is the locus
  of points with zero curvature in the phase plane. This approach is applied to various
  chemical systems, including the oscillatory EOE reaction, the Autocatalator, and
  the two-variable Oregonator.
