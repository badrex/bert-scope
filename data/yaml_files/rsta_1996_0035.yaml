tldr: This paper studies the interaction of local saddle node and Hopf bifurcations
  with global recurrent orbits in a four-parameter family of three-dimensional vector
  fields. The authors discover homoclinic bifurcations where a unique connecting orbit
  is replaced by a countable infinity of orbits (explosion) and where a countable
  infinity collapses to a unique orbit (implosion). They also find a rich variety
  of heteroclinic connections among fixed points and periodic orbits. These findings
  have implications for the study of travelling wave structures in the complex Ginzburg-Landau
  partial differential equation.
