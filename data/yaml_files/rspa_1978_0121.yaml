tldr: This article explores the frictional force caused by non-retarded van der Waals
  interactions. The authors develop a simplified method to calculate the force, which
  is essential for understanding macroscopic interactions and the role of electromagnetic
  fluctuations in friction. The findings can help improve our understanding of the
  behavior of materials and their interactions in various applications.
