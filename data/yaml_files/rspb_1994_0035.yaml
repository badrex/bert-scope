tldr: The study investigates the properties of the basolateral membrane of cochlear
  outer hair cells and their response to mechanical deformation. Stretching the membrane
  generates transient inward and outward currents, which are velocity-dependent. These
  currents are not associated with ion channel gating or ion movement, suggesting
  that membrane stretch can induce a rapid charge movement resulting from the reversal
  of the electromechanical transduction process in outer hair cells.
