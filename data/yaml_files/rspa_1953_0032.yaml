tldr: This article discusses the exceptional cases of the electromagnetic interpretation
  problem, where the proposed problem has no unique solution. The authors explain
  that the failure of the general method in these cases is due to the degeneration
  of the kernel function to a constant, leading to the non-existence of the required
  power series expansion. They provide a simple physical example of this failure and
  emphasize the importance of using a non-degenerate source or excitation function
  for the validity of the interpretation process.
