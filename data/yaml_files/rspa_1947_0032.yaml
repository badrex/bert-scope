tldr: This article presents tables of second virial and low-pressure Joule-Thomson
  coefficients for intermolecular potentials with exponential repulsion. The authors
  compute these coefficients for a potential derived from the Lennard-Jones potential
  by replacing the inverse-power repulsion with an exponential term. The tables cover
  a range of parameters and temperatures, and the results can be applied to various
  substances.
