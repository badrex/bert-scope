tldr: The authors discuss myelins, myelin bodies, and their properties, including
  their ability to swell in water and exhibit irregular forms. They also describe
  the discovery of double refraction in myelin bodies, which led to the investigation
  of fluid spherocrystals. These fluid crystals are substances that can pass from
  a solid state to a fluid state, maintaining their crystalline features under polarized
  light. The authors identify several substances, such as esters and oleic acid groups,
  that exhibit these properties and contribute to the understanding of myelin bodies
  in organisms.
