tldr: The authors conducted a study on the relationship between pulse rate and oxygen
  intake during the early stages of recovery from severe exercise. They found that
  the oxygen intake decreases more rapidly than the pulse rate, suggesting that the
  heart's output per beat is reduced after exercise. This indicates that the body's
  need for oxygen is not met immediately after exercise, and the authors propose that
  the output of the heart per beat is diminished due to the sudden stoppage of bodily
  movements that aid in venous return.
