tldr: This article explores the relationship between RNA sequences and their secondary
  structures, demonstrating that the number of structures is much smaller than the
  number of sequences. The authors also show that sequences folding into the same
  structure are randomly distributed in the space of compatible sequences, and discuss
  the implications for evolutionary adaptation and applied molecular evolution.
