tldr: The authors used molecular dynamics simulations to study the motion of Frenkel
  defects in model normal and fast-ion conductors, focusing on NaCl and AgCl. They
  observed direct interstitial jumps, collinear interstitialcy migration, and [110]
  vacancy jumps, and analyzed the time dependence of mean square displacements to
  understand defect migration mechanisms. This research provides insights into the
  ionic transport in fast-ion conductors and the behavior of Frenkel defects.
