tldr: The authors propose a new approach to calculate the density of eigenvalues and
  localization in a general disordered system using a functional integral method.
  They consider a system of non-interacting electrons in a random potential described
  by a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The density of states is calculated for
  a model characteristic of a highly doped semiconductor, showing an exponential behavior
  at negative energies and a proportional relationship to energy (E) at positive energies.
  The authors also discuss the localization criterion and the mobility edge in amorphous
  solids.
