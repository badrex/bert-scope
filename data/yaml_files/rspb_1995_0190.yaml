tldr: This study demonstrates that chimaeras of the colonial ascidian Botryllus schlosseri
  have highly plastic life histories and adapt different strategies based on their
  environment. In the field, chimaeras grow rapidly, reach large sizes, and produce
  many eggs, while in the laboratory, they grow slowly, shrink, and fragment. The
  phenomenon of resorption, where tissues of one genotype are consumed by the other,
  occurs mainly in the laboratory environment and not in the field. These findings
  show the importance of understanding life history patterns in chimaeras to predict
  their evolution and adaptability.
