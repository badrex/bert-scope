tldr: The author examines the possibility of a 26.67-day periodic change in the Earth's
  magnetism, which could be related to the rotation of the Sun. The study analyzes
  hourly measurements of terrestrial magnetic elements over several years, considering
  the impact of temperature variations and instrument adjustments. The results show
  that while some patterns exist, they are not strong enough to definitively link
  the changes to solar rotation.
