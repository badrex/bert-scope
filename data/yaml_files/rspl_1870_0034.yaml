tldr: Prof. Sir William Thomson modifies Wheatstone's bridge to measure the resistance
  of a galvanometer-coil using a single deflection of its own needle. This simple
  method involves using the galvanometer as one of the four conductors in the bridge
  and adjusting it until the galvanometer shows an unchanged deflection. This technique
  proves to be an innovative and efficient way to measure galvanometer resistance.
