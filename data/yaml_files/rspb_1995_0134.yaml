tldr: The study investigates the role of adrenoceptors in the cryptic patterning of
  the flatfish, Pleuronectes americanus. The researchers found that a-adrenoceptors
  mediate melanosome aggregation in each pattern component, with differential responsiveness
  to noradrenaline. The study also demonstrates pattern-related presynaptic neuromodulation
  and provides insights into the neural and hormonal control of melanophores in teleosts.
