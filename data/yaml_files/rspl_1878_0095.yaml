tldr: The author conducted experiments with radiometers to study the effects of radiation
  and molecular pressure. They discovered that the movements of the radiometers were
  influenced by the distance, position, and shape of the screens and vanes. The author
  explained these phenomena by considering the generation of molecular pressure and
  the behavior of lines of force of repulsion. This research contributed to the understanding
  of the interactions between radiation, heat, and pressure in radiometers.
