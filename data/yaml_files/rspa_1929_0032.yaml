tldr: This article explores the probability of excitation in neon through electron
  impact. The authors develop a new method to estimate the average probability of
  excitation, taking into account the effects of inelastic collisions and ionization.
  Their findings contribute to a better understanding of the distribution of energies
  in electron streams and the role of atomic properties in determining the probability
  of excitation.
