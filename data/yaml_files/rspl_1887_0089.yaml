tldr: This article examines the composition and impurities of sewer air, focusing
  on carbonic acid, organic matter, and microorganisms. The authors conclude that
  the air in sewers is generally better ventilated and less polluted than previously
  thought, with most microorganisms coming from outside sources. They also emphasize
  the importance of proper sewer design to prevent the spread of microorganisms and
  suggest that sewer air may not have as many negative health effects as previously
  believed.
