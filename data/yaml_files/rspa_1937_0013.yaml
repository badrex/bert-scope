- Water of crystallization
- Fricke's equation
- Molecular refractivity
tldr: The authors investigated the dielectric constants of solid materials and found
  that the dielectric constant of a hydrated salt is lower than that of its dehydrated
  form. They tested Fricke's equation for mixtures of powdered salts in oil and determined
  the proper value of the constant for accurate calculations. The study also showed
  that the change in molecular refractivity per molecule of water of crystallization
  is approximately constant.
