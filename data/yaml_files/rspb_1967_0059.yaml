tldr: This study by Broadbent and Gregory investigates the psychological refractory
  period and its effect on decision-making. They found that when two stimuli are presented
  in quick succession, the reaction to the second stimulus is delayed. This delay
  is due to the limited capacity of the decision-making mechanism, which is occupied
  by the first reaction and cannot process the second stimulus simultaneously. The
  results support the theory that the decision mechanism operates on discrete samples
  of sensory information rather than a continuous flow.
