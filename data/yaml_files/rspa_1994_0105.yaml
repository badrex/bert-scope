tldr: The authors present a numerical study of scalar wave scattering from two-dimensional
  periodic surfaces of arbitrary shape. By simulating an infinite and bi-periodic
  surface, they can analyze scattering from two-dimensional surfaces, even at near-grazing
  angles. This research helps improve the understanding of scattering problems and
  has applications in coastal and shipborne radar backscatter from rough ocean surfaces.
