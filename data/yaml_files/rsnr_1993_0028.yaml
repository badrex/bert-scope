tldr: This article discusses the historical connection between the Royal Society and
  the Chelsea Physic Garden, focusing on the annual submission of dried plant specimens
  from the garden to the Royal Society between 1722 and 1799. The specimens provide
  valuable evidence of the plants grown in the garden during that time and contribute
  to the understanding of botanical history and plant introductions.
