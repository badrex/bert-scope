tldr: The authors generalize the results of atomistic calculations of long-period
  tilt boundaries and introduce the concept of decomposition lattices to represent
  the structures of non-favored boundaries between adjacent favored boundaries. They
  deduce selection rules for adjacent favored boundaries and discuss various aspects
  of intrinsic and extrinsic grain boundary dislocations. A general classification
  of grain boundary properties is introduced, and the energy against misorientation
  relation, grain boundary diffusion, and grain boundary sliding and migration are
  discussed in the context of the structural investigation.
