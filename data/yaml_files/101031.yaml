tldr: In 1669, Dr. William Durston reported on the autopsy of Elizabeth Travers, a
  woman with exceptionally large breasts. He described the size and weight of her
  breasts, the lack of abnormalities upon dissection, and the treatments he attempted,
  including salivation and caustic application. Durston's observations provided insight
  into the anatomy and medical treatment of breast-related issues during the 17th
  century.
