tldr: The article discusses the propagation of elastic waves in aeolotropic media
  and introduces the concept of wave surfaces. Using the principle of least action,
  the authors derive the equations of motion and momentum conditions for elastic disturbances
  in any continuous medium. They define the wave surface as the first negative pedal
  of the surface of phase velocities for elastic plane waves in the medium and provide
  a general method for obtaining the forms of these surfaces.
