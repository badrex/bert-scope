tldr: The author examines the spectra of argon gas using a spectroscope and a spectrograph,
  discovering two distinct spectra called red and blue argon. The red spectrum is
  produced by a lower electromotive force, while the blue spectrum requires a higher
  electromotive force and a hot spark. The author also discusses the process of purifying
  argon gas and the differences in spectra when mixed with nitrogen.
