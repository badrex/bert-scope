tldr: The Western European Winter Anomaly Campaign studied the atmospheric and ionospheric
  coupling during pronounced disturbances of ionospheric E-region electron density.
  The campaign involved ground-based, balloon-borne, and rocket-borne experiments,
  as well as remote sensing satellite experiments. The main findings include enhanced
  electron densities, increased ion production rates, and low electron loss rates
  during winter anomaly events. The campaign provided insights into the complex interactions
  between the atmosphere and ionosphere and the factors influencing the winter anomaly
  phenomenon.
