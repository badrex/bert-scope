tldr: The author discusses the effect of ether drift on the refraction and reflection
  of light. They analyze the angles of incidence and reflection and conclude that
  the ordinary laws of refraction and reflection are not always obeyed due to the
  ether's motion. The author suggests that the effect of ether drift on terrestrial
  sources could be examined by observing the motion of the ether near the Earth.
