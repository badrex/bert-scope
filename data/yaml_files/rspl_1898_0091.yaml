tldr: This article discusses the densities of atmospheric nitrogen, pure nitrogen,
  and argon. The author compares different sets of data and concludes that the density
  of "atmospheric" nitrogen is correctly given as the mean of the densities of the
  constituents, taken in the proportion in which they occur. The results support the
  idea that argon is a pure substance and a new constituent of the atmosphere.
