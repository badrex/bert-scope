tldr: The author examines the structure and secretory apparatus of the liver, focusing
  on the arrangement of epithelial cells and their role in bile secretion. They argue
  against the existence of a lobular biliary plexus and propose that the linear arrangement
  of cells represents an intermediate stage in the development of primary duct tubules.
  The study provides insights into liver function and the process of secretion.
