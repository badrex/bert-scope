tldr: This article investigates the properties and phase transitions of copper-tin
  alloys. The authors use chilling techniques to study the alloys' structures and
  determine their states of aggregation. They present a detailed phase diagram, identifying
  various phases and mixed crystals, and discuss the implications of their findings
  for metallurgy and alloy chemistry.
