tldr: The study investigates the fine structure of the PD proprioceptor in the crab
  Cancer pagurus. The receptor consists of a strand with dendrites of up to 80 bipolar
  nerve cells. The sensory cells can be divided into movement-sensitive and position-sensitive
  cells. The structure and function of the scolopidia, which contain the dendritic
  terminations of sensory neurons, are examined in detail. The research provides insights
  into the mechanisms of proprioception in arthropods and the role of the PD proprioceptor
  in monitoring joint movements.
