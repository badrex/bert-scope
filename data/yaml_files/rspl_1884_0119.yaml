tldr: This paper examines the microscopic changes that occur in glass samples when
  exposed to high temperatures, focusing on the crystallization process and the development
  of prismatic jointing. The authors compare these phenomena to natural devitrification
  in rocks, providing insights into the geological and petrological aspects of glass
  transformation.
