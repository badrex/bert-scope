tldr: The author, William Gregor, describes the discovery of a native arseniate of
  lead found in a copper mine in Gwennap. The ore contains 26.4% arsenic acid and
  69.4% oxide of lead. The author provides a detailed analysis of the ore's composition,
  including the presence of muriatic acid, iron, and silica. The paper concludes with
  the chemical composition of the ore, which is essential for understanding its properties
  and potential uses.
