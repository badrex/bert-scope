tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Richard Alan Morton, a prominent biochemist
  who made significant contributions to the field of vitamin research. Morton's work
  focused on the application of spectroscopy to chemical and biological problems,
  particularly the study of vitamins A and D. His research led to the discovery of
  vitamin A2, the identification of ergosterol as a precursor of vitamin D, and the
  development of techniques for the oxidation of vitamins A and A2. Morton's work
  had a lasting impact on the understanding of vitamin function and the use of spectroscopy
  as a research tool in biochemistry.
