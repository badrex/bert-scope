tldr: The author, Christopher Merret, conducted experiments on grafting tree bark
  and found that it successfully united with the tree during the spring season. He
  observed that the sap's movement played a crucial role in the grafting process,
  and it was unsuccessful during the winter season. The experiments also showed that
  withering of branches occurred when grafting was unsuccessful.
