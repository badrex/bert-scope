tldr: This article discusses various mechanisms of disease resistance in plants, focusing
  on the hypersensitive reaction, phytoalexins, and other factors that prevent or
  slow down the growth of pathogens. It explores the significance of these mechanisms
  in protecting plants from infections and damage caused by bacteria, fungi, and other
  infectious agents.
