tldr: This article discusses the future developments in non-ferrous metallurgy, focusing
  on the exploitation of metallurgical phenomena such as superelasticity, shape memory
  alloys, and ferro-elasticity. The author highlights the potential for new materials
  and improved properties in age-hardenable alloys like aluminum-lithium and copper,
  as well as the importance of understanding grain boundary properties and trace elements
  in the development of new non-ferrous materials.
