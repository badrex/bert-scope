tldr: This article investigates the deformation and microstructure of rutile, a form
  of titanium dioxide, focusing on the role of defects and doping. The authors study
  the interaction of dislocations with intrinsic and extrinsic defects in non-doped
  rutile and rutile doped with trivalent cations, such as chromium and aluminum. They
  use transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy to
  analyze the microstructure and correlate it with the material's deformation behavior.
  The results provide insights into the mechanical properties and potential applications
  of rutile in various industries.
