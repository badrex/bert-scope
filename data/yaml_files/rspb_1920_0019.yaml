tldr: The author discusses the rostro-carinate flint implements, a unique type of
  prehistoric tool with a distinct design, found in various deposits in England and
  Ireland. These tools are different from previously known Paleolithic implements
  and cannot be assigned to any Neolithic type. The author examines the specimens'
  characteristics, their geological context, and their possible origins, suggesting
  that they may have remained undisturbed on the land surface or embedded superficially
  for long ages after their creation.
