tldr: The author, Joseph Swan, examines the similarities in the nervous systems of
  various vertebrate animals and infers that only a small portion of the brain is
  necessary for the origins of nerves. He traces the origins of nerves in different
  cases and considers the cerebellum as an appendage to the brain rather than to the
  medulla oblongata and spinal nerves. Swan also discusses the role of the corpus
  striatum in conveying the perception of limb motions and the double crossings of
  nerve tracts in the arms and legs, providing explanations for various pathological
  phenomena.
