tldr: This article discusses the principles and operation of various types of lasers
  for spectroscopic use, focusing on dye lasers and excimer lasers. It covers topics
  such as narrow-bandwidth and mode-locked tunable dye lasers, harmonic generation,
  stimulated Raman scattering, and techniques for generating high-power ultraviolet
  radiation. The article also explores the advantages and limitations of different
  laser types and their applications in spectroscopy.
