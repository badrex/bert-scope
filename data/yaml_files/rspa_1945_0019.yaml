tldr: The authors present a general theoretical solution for stress distributions
  in isotropic and aeolotropic plates containing various types of holes. The solution
  includes previously known results for isotropic materials and provides new results
  for both isotropic and aeolotropic plates. Numerical results are given for stress
  distributions around holes with different shapes, such as elliptical, rectangular,
  and square with rounded corners. The study focuses on stress systems that produce
  zero force resultants at the edge of the hole.
