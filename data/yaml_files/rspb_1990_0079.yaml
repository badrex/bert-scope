tldr: The article discusses the discovery of GABA-induced potassium channels in cultured
  rat hippocampal neurons. These channels appear after a delay and are associated
  with GABAb receptors. The study suggests that binding of GABA to GABAb receptors
  activates a second messenger system, causing the opening of oligomeric potassium
  channels.
