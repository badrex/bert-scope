tldr: In this article, the author describes the discovery of a new malaria parasite,
  which they name Plasmodium tenue. This parasite is morphologically distinct from
  previously known malaria parasites, featuring extreme amoeboid activity, delicate
  processes, and a unique arrangement of chromatin. The author discusses the differences
  between this new parasite and other malaria parasites, such as malignant tertian,
  simple tertian, and quartan, and proposes further research to understand its characteristics
  and effects on human health.
