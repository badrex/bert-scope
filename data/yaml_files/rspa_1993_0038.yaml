tldr: The authors develop an asymptotic theory for studying the dynamics of unbounded
  stratified flow over finite-height topography near the hydrostatic limit. This theory
  generalizes Long's model and can be used to investigate the long-time evolution
  of the response up to the time wave breaking first occurs. The theory is particularly
  useful for understanding the behavior of the fluid near the hydrostatic limit, where
  the spectrum of long-wave modes is continuous, and resonance occurs at all flow
  speeds.
