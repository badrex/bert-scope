tldr: The author examines the tooth structure of Ornithodelphia, specifically Ornithorhynchus,
  and compares it to Sauropsida and other reptiles. They find that the teeth of Ornithorhynchus
  are distinctly mammalian, suggesting that the dual origin theory of mammals may
  be incorrect. The author also discusses the possibility of Monotremes being an example
  of degradation and reversion, rather than a separate evolutionary branch.
