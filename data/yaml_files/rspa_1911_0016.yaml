tldr: The author investigates the properties of Fourier constants and their coefficients
  in a Fourier series. They prove that the series converges under various conditions,
  such as when the function is of bounded variation or has a Harnack-Lebesgue integral.
  The study also includes the Cesaro summation method for series convergence.
