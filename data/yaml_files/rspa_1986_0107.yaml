revised_title: Maxwell's Equations and Electromagnetic Waves in Kerr Geometry
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetic Theory
semantic_tags:
- Electromagnetic Waves
- Kerr Geometry
- Maxwell's Equations
- Separation of Variables
- Operator Characterization
tldr: The authors derive the analogues of electric and magnetic multipoles for electromagnetic
  waves in Kerr geometry and provide an operator characterization. They also find
  a new family of solutions for Maxwell's equations in Kerr geometry, which correspond
  to electric and magnetic multipoles in Minkowski space.
