tldr: The author examines the skull structure of mammal-like reptiles from the suborder
  Therocephalia, focusing on their anatomy and dental succession. They analyze various
  specimens, including those with two large functional canines, and study the internal
  structure of the skulls through sectioning. This research helps to better understand
  the evolution of these reptiles and their relation to early mammals.
