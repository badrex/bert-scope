tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of branched-chain paraffin
  hydrocarbons, including iso-butane, iso-pentane, and neo-pentane. The authors found
  that these hydrocarbons decompose partly by radical chain reactions and partly by
  molecular reactions. The molecular decomposition persists even when the chain reactions
  are suppressed by nitric oxide. The decomposition rates of these branched-chain
  paraffins are similar to ethane and differ from their normal isomers.
