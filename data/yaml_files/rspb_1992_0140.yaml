tldr: The authors studied a TTX-sensitive sodium current in native Xenopus oocytes
  and characterized its electrophysiological properties. The current was activated
  by depolarizations to -50 mV or higher, had a peak current within 3-5 ms, and displayed
  voltage-dependent inactivation. The sodium channel responsible for this current
  was blocked by tetrodotoxin with a K0.5 of 8 nM and was resistant to block by lidocaine
  at concentrations up to 100 ÂµM.
