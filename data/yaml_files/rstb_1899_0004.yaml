tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frog skeletal muscles to study the effects
  of temperature on muscle contractions. They discovered that there are two distinct
  contractions occurring in response to increasing temperature. The first contraction
  is the one previously studied by other researchers, while the second contraction
  is less understood and requires further investigation. The authors also discuss
  the differences between heat-rigor and rigor-mortis and their effects on muscle
  excitability.
