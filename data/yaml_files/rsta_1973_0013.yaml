tldr: The authors study the northern margin of the Limpopo orogenic belt in southern
  Africa, identifying it as a large-scale ductile shear zone with up to 200 km of
  right-lateral displacement. They analyze the structure and deformation history of
  the area, providing insights into the evolution of the Precambrian crust and the
  movement of tectonic plates in the region.
