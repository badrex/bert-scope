tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on carbon dioxide assimilation
  in cherry-laurel leaves. The researchers found that the amount of CO2 assimilated
  increases with temperature, reaching a peak at around 38°C. At higher temperatures,
  the leaves' ability to maintain high rates of assimilation declines rapidly, and
  the leaves eventually become unable to survive. The study emphasizes the importance
  of considering both temperature and respiration when studying plant assimilation.
