tldr: This study examines the morphological changes and population fluctuations of
  oogonia and oocytes in the ovaries of foetal and neonatal rats. The research provides
  a detailed quantitative analysis of germ cell populations at different developmental
  stages, correlating these findings with previous radio-sensitivity studies. The
  results reveal two periods of high radio-sensitivity in the germ cells, with the
  first period associated with a high incidence of oogonial divisions and the second
  period linked to the end of prophase and the onset of the dictyate or resting phase.
