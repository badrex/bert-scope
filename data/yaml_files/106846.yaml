tldr: Edward Pigott determined the longitudes and latitudes of several notable places
  near the Severn River using trigonometric methods. He measured the distances between
  these locations and their relative positions, providing more precise geographical
  information than typical astronomical observations. This research improved the accuracy
  of mapping and surveying techniques during that time.
