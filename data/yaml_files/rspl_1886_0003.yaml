tldr: The author's research focuses on the thyroid gland's function in metabolism
  and its impact on nerve centers. They discovered that the thyroid gland plays a
  crucial role in controlling mucin metabolism and hemapoiesis. The removal of the
  gland causes symptoms similar to old age, such as wasting, atrophy, and falling
  out of hair, decay of teeth, and dryness of the skin. The study also found that
  the temperature at which animals are kept after thyroidectomy influences the course
  of symptoms, with higher temperatures prolonging the duration of life and modifying
  the symptoms.
