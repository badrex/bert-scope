tldr: The author investigates the softening of radiation by multiple Compton scattering
  in an atmosphere of free electrons. They develop a mathematical model and solve
  it using a method of approximation, providing insights into the spectral distribution
  of the emergent radiation. This study has implications for astrophysics and understanding
  radiation in various contexts.
