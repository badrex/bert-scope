tldr: Faraday conducted experiments using a ring helix to study the effects of atmospheric
  temperature on magnetic forces. He observed the deflection of magnetic needles in
  various positions and conditions, including near magnets and in different regions
  of the Earth. Faraday applied these findings to explain magnetic variations, such
  as night action, early morning effects, and differences in local time. He concluded
  that his experimental results supported his views on the cause of magnetic variations.
