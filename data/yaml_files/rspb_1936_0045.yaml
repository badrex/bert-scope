tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of different wavelengths
  of ultra-violet light on the growth of various bacteria species. They found that
  bacteria have varying levels of sensitivity to different wavelengths of ultra-violet
  light, and that exposure to certain wavelengths can significantly reduce bacterial
  growth. The study also introduced a new technique for measuring bacterial growth
  using a photoelectric effect.
