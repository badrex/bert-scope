tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the thermal conductivity of 32
  metals at low temperatures. The research aimed to collect data to understand the
  heat conductivity of metals at low temperatures and provide insights for theoretical
  improvements. The thermal conductivity measurements were made on metal samples in
  the form of rods, and the results showed that the thermal resistance of nearly all
  metals at low temperatures is of the lattice type. The study also investigated the
  effect of high magnetic fields on the thermal conductivity of metals in the normal
  state.
