tldr: The author investigates the electronic properties of dilute synthetic metals
  created by intercalation of electron acceptor molecules between the carbon hexagon
  networks of well-oriented graphite. They determine resistivities and Hall coefficients
  for graphite bisulphates and, to a lesser extent, graphite perchlorates. The author
  finds peak anomalies in Hall effects at around 20 K, which they discuss in relation
  to possible changes in the structure of the intercalate layers with temperature.
