tldr: This study investigates the initial reactions of blood components and the intima
  of the rabbit abdominal aorta after mechanical injury. The researchers observed
  platelet and leucocyte adhesion to the injured surface and used scanning and transmission
  electron microscopy to analyze the process. The findings provide insights into the
  immune response and thrombosis formation following vascular injury.
