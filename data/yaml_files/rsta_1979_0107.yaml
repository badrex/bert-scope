tldr: This article investigates the dynamic aspects of light scattering by gases,
  focusing on the rotational Raman and depolarized Rayleigh spectra. The authors conducted
  experiments with hydrogen isotopes to study the effects of molecular collisions
  on spectral line shapes, providing insights into intermolecular collision processes
  and gas dynamics.
