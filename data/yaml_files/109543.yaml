tldr: In this lecture, Thomas Young presents a new theory of light and colors, proposing
  that light is made up of undulations in the luminiferous ether. He explains how
  the sensation of different colors depends on the frequency of these vibrations in
  the retina. Young's theory also accounts for phenomena such as refraction, reflection,
  and dispersion of colors, providing a more comprehensive understanding of light
  and its properties.
