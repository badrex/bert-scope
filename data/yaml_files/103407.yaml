tldr: The author, Mr. Leeuwenhoek, observed the membranes surrounding muscle fibers
  using a microscope. He discovered that these membranes are composed of numerous
  small vessels that transport nutrients. The author also found that fat particles
  are formed within these vessels and that they are not separated from the blood.
  This research provided insights into muscle and fat formation.
