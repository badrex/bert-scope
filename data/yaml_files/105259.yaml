tldr: In 1757, a massive ship repair operation took place in Portsmouth Dockyard,
  where the Royal William, a first-rate man of war, was lifted and placed on blocks
  for repair. The operation involved 270 men, 80 feet of shores, and nine pairs of
  bed-screws to lift the ship's head. The author also calculated the ship's weight,
  which was 1576 tons, and discussed the challenges and methods used in the process.
