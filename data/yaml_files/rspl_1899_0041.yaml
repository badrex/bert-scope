tldr: The authors explore the application of Fourier's double integrals to optical
  problems, specifically the representation of non-periodic light radiation. They
  demonstrate the connection between Fourier's calculus and physical analysis of light,
  discussing applications such as incandescent gas radiation, Rontgen rays, and radiative
  damping of molecular vibrations.
