tldr: This article discusses the non-equilibrium freezing behavior of aqueous systems,
  focusing on supercooling and homogeneous nucleation. The authors explore the properties
  of supercooled water and heavy water, and their findings suggest that increased
  supercooling promotes a more structured state in the water, leading to a greater
  tendency for water molecules to form clusters. The article also highlights the need
  for further research on the thermodynamic properties of supercooled water and heavy
  water.
