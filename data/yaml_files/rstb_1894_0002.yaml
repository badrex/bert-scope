tldr: The author describes the discovery of a unique skull belonging to the extinct
  mammal Megaladapis madagascariensis, found in Madagascar. This gigantic lemuroid
  species had a distinct skull structure with a broad interorbital region, large orbits,
  and a short, low braincase. The author discusses the differences between this skull
  and the typical Lemurid skull, suggesting a closer relationship with Marsupials
  and Insectivores.
