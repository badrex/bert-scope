tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the plastic distortion of metals, specifically
  copper, aluminum, and mild steel tubes. They discovered that the material behaves
  differently depending on the size of the crystals and the degree of isotropy. The
  results showed that the distortion is influenced by the crystal structure and the
  anisotropic nature of the material, which affects the changes in internal volume
  and the orientation of the principal axes of stress and strain.
