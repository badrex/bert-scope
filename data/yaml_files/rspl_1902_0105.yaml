tldr: The authors discovered that injecting intracellular contents of the typhoid
  bacillus into monkeys creates a serum with antibacterial and antitoxic properties.
  This serum can protect and cure animals from the typhoid bacillus and its toxic
  intracellular juice. This research provides evidence that intracellular juices of
  a pathogenic bacterium can create a serum that is both bactericidal and antitoxic.
