tldr: John P. Gassiot conducted a series of experiments with a large water battery
  to study the relationship between electrical and chemical actions in voltaic circuits.
  He discovered that the elements in the battery develop polar tension before the
  circuit is completed, and that static effects precede and are independent of the
  completion of the voltaic circuit. Gassiot also found that the chemical effects
  in the experiments were very weak but similar to those exhibited by more powerful
  voltaic combinations.
