tldr: This article examines the differences between literary and scientific styles
  by comparing the letters and articles of physicist Max Born. It explores the question
  of whether a scientist's scientific prose is different from their literary prose
  and uses statistical analysis to determine the probability that the sentence-lengths
  in scientific and literary texts come from the same distribution. The study finds
  that the probability is very low, indicating that scientific and literary texts
  have distinct writing styles.
