tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the development of organisms in organic
  infusions and the resistance to sterilization. They found that some infusions, such
  as cucumber-infusion, were highly resistant to sterilization, while others, like
  hay-infusion, could be easily sterilized. The author discovered that the drying
  and hardening of germs in old hay contributed to its greater resistance to sterilization.
  This research helped to understand the factors affecting the growth and development
  of organisms in different types of infusions.
