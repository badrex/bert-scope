tldr: This study examines the anatomy of the nervous system in the genus Gerris (Hemiptera-Heteroptera)
  and provides a comprehensive account of its structure and function. The research
  focuses on Gerris lacustris L., a common species found on the surface of still and
  flowing waters. The condensed condition of the central nervous system, specializations
  of the peripheral nervous system, and polymorphism of the flight apparatus are the
  main interests in this study. The research uses various histological methods to
  analyze the nervous system and its connections with muscles and sensory fields.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of insect neurology and the complex
  organization of the nervous system in this group of insects.
