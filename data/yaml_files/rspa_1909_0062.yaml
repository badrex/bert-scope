tldr: This article investigates the liquidus curves of the ternary system of aluminium,
  copper, and tin alloys. The authors discuss the importance of understanding the
  constitution of alloys containing three or more metals and present their findings
  on the liquidus curves of the aluminium-copper-tin system. They also describe the
  methods used to create and analyze the alloys, as well as the challenges encountered
  in achieving homogeneity in some of the samples.
