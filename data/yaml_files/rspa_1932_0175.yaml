tldr: This article investigates the distribution of suspended particles under gravity
  and examines the discrepancies between various experimental results. The authors
  argue that the simple exponential formula cannot hold in regions where particles
  occupy a significant fraction of the total volume and question whether the laws
  of dilute solutions break down completely at low concentrations. They also criticize
  the experimental methods used in some studies, emphasizing the importance of ensuring
  equilibrium before measuring particle concentrations.
