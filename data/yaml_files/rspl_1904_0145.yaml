tldr: This article presents experiments conducted by Bertram Hopkinson on the effects
  of momentary stresses in metals, specifically iron and copper wires. Using a wave-meter,
  Hopkinson measured the momentary extension of the wires and compared it to the theoretical
  calculations. The results showed that both iron and copper wires can be stressed
  beyond their static elastic limit and breaking loads without losing proportionality
  of stresses and strains, provided the stress is applied for a short time, around
  1/1000 second.
