tldr: The authors conducted extensive experiments to study the nature of atmospherics
  and wave forms. They used improved techniques and equipment to record and analyze
  wave forms at different locations. Their findings revealed that the wave forms and
  their temporal incidence were influenced by the distance between the observing station
  and the discharge channel. This research contributed to the understanding of atmospheric
  phenomena and their impact on radio signals.
