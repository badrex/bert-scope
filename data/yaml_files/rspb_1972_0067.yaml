tldr: This study investigates the neurophysins and posterior pituitary hormones in
  Suiformes species, specifically the hippopotamus and warthog. The researchers found
  that the warthog has a protein electrophoretically and immunologically identical
  to porcine neurophysin II, while the hippopotamus' neurohypophysial proteins do
  not cross-react with a rabbit antiserum specific to this protein. The study also
  recharacterized the vasopressins of the hippopotamus and warthog, confirming the
  presence of [8-arginine]-vasopressin (AVP) in the hippopotamus and [8-lysine]-vasopressin
  (LVP) in the warthog.
