tldr: The article discusses the life and scientific contributions of George Johnstone
  Stoney, who determined the charge of the atom or particle of electricity and proposed
  the name "electron" for this quantity. Stoney's work on the kinetic theory of gases
  and spectroscopy was his most significant achievement, and he made the first estimate
  of the electron's value in 1874.
