tldr: This article discusses the use of the Laue method in time-resolved macromolecular
  crystallography to observe short-lived species in enzyme reactions. The authors
  explore different triggering methods, such as pH jumps, temperature jumps, and metal
  ion diffusion, to generate the desired intermediate species with high occupancy
  in the crystal lattice. They also address the challenges of synchronization and
  the potential of the Laue technique in studying unstable species accumulated under
  defined conditions for short periods of time.
