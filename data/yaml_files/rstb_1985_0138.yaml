tldr: This article reviews the geological setting, biotic diversity, and taphonomy
  of Cambrian soft-bodied Lagerstatten, focusing on the Lower Cambrian Emu Bay Shale
  and Kinzers Formation, and the Middle Cambrian Stephen Formation. It discusses the
  significance of these exceptional fossil deposits in understanding early metazoan
  diversification, the appearance and success of various body plans, and the ecology
  of soft-bodied and lightly skeletized taxa in comparison to well-mineralized groups.
