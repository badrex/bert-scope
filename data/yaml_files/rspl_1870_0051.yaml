tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of diet and exercise on
  nitrogen elimination in a healthy man. They found that there was an increased elimination
  of nitrogen after exercise, regardless of the type of diet consumed. The results
  support the idea that exercise affects nitrogen metabolism, but further research
  is needed to understand the full implications of these findings.
