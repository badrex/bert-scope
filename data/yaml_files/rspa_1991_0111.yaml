tldr: The authors present a general method to obtain the elastic field in two joined
  semi-infinite isotropic solids due to an inclusion of any shape undergoing a spontaneous
  change of shape. The method uses Galerkin vectors for nuclei of strain in the two
  joined semi-infinite solids and can be applied to inclusions with uniform eigenstrains
  of practical interest. The solution for ellipsoidal inclusions with uniform eigenstrains
  is expressible in terms of known functions, and existing solutions for the inclusion
  in a semi-infinite solid are shown to be special cases of the present general solution.
