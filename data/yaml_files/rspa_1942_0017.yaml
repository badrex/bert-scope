tldr: This article investigates the spectra of chilled hydrocarbon flames and the
  effects of various conditions on their combustion. The authors discovered that the
  presence of hydrocarbon flame bands is closely associated with the formation of
  peroxides, likely alkyl peroxides. They also found that chilling the flames enhances
  the intensity of these bands, suggesting that temperature and surface action play
  a role in their appearance.
