tldr: This article discusses Charles Wheatstone's research on binocular vision and
  the pseudoscope, an instrument that creates stereoscopic illusions by inverting
  the perceived distances of objects. Wheatstone describes the construction and effects
  of the pseudoscope, as well as various optical illusions it can produce, such as
  converting the inside of a teacup into a solid convex body and making a bust appear
  as a deep hollow mask.
