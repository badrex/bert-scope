tldr: This article discusses the achievements and limitations of conventional plant
  breeding in improving crop yields, resistance to environmental hazards, and product
  quality. It highlights the importance of varietal improvements in increasing harvest
  index and the need for further research in increasing total biomass and photosynthesis
  rates to enhance crop yields. The article also emphasizes the challenges faced in
  breeding for resistance to pathogens and the need for more efficient use of genetic
  resources.
