tldr: The author presents a method to overcome the difficulty of Hilbert's process
  in the context of electromagnetic field equations and general relativity. They introduce
  a world-function that generalizes the work of Hilbert, Lorentz, and Weyl, allowing
  for the existence of magnetic currents and light-pulses in the theory of general
  relativity. The author derives the differential equations involved in the variational
  principle, including the field equations of gravitation and the equations of motion
  for particles carrying electric and magnetic charges.
