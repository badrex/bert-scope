tldr: This article investigates the chemical reaction rates between chlorates and
  chlorides, focusing on the reaction between hydrogen chloride and potassium chlorate.
  The authors found that the rate of decomposition is constant and depends on the
  amount of each substance present. They also studied the effects of varying the proportions
  of the reactants, the presence of potassium chloride, and the temperature on the
  reaction rate.
