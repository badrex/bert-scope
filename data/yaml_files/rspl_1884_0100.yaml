tldr: 'The author investigates the coloration of phytophagous larvae and discovers
  that their colors are due to two factors: pigments derived from their food-plants,
  such as chlorophyll and xanthophyll, and pigments specific to the larvae. The study
  also introduces the concept of metachlorophyll, a modified form of chlorophyll found
  in green larvae. This research helps to understand the relationship between larval
  and plant colors and the role of natural selection in the development of these colors
  for protection and camouflage.'
