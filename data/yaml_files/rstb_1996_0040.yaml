tldr: This article explores the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) in the development,
  maintenance, and injury of sensory neurons. It discusses how NGF contributes to
  the production of persistent pain by altering the phenotype of primary sensory neurons
  during inflammation. The study also highlights the importance of NGF in peripheral
  sensitization of high-threshold thermoreceptors and its potential role in peripheral
  pain mechanisms.
