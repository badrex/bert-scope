tldr: In 1901, E. Walter Maunder and T. F. Claxton led an expedition to Mauritius
  to observe the total solar eclipse. They used multiple instruments, including a
  16-inch coelostat and a 6-inch equatorial, to study the solar corona and photograph
  the eclipse. The observations took place at the Royal Alfred Observatory in Pamplemousses,
  and the team worked together with local support to capture valuable data during
  the event.
