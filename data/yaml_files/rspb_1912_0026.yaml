tldr: The authors studied the physiological effects of low atmospheric pressure on
  Pike's Peak, Colorado. They observed signs of acclimatization and various symptoms
  related to oxygen deficiency. The study found that adaptation to low barometric
  pressure occurs through increased lung ventilation, increased haemoglobin percentage
  in the blood, and enhanced secretory activity of the alveolar epithelium. Acclimatization
  takes several days to develop, which explains the difference in experiences between
  mountaineers and balloonists.
