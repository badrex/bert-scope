tldr: The author examines the internal anatomy of Stomoxys, a type of fly, and compares
  it to Glossina, the tsetse fly. They describe the digestive, excretory, and nervous
  systems, as well as the reproductive organs and blood vessels. The study provides
  insights into the differences and similarities between the two species, which can
  help in understanding their roles in the transmission of diseases.
