tldr: The authors examine the stability of a viscous, conducting fluid in motion between
  two parallel planes in the presence of a co-planar magnetic field. They derive linearized
  equations and find that the critical Reynolds number above which the flow becomes
  unstable increases with the strength of the magnetic field. An energy relation is
  also derived, illustrating the exchange of energy between the basic flow and the
  disturbances.
