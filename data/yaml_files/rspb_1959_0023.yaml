tldr: The authors isolated and analyzed histones from different cell types of domestic
  fowl, including erythrocytes, lymphocytes, and hepatic cells. They found differences
  in the contents of particular amino acids in the histones from each cell type, suggesting
  that the histones are cell-specific. This discovery has implications for understanding
  the role of histones in cell function and development.
