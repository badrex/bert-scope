tldr: The author investigates the magnetic and physical properties of iron at high
  temperatures, discovering that the critical temperature for various iron samples
  ranges from 69°C to 77°C. The study also reveals that the temperature coefficient
  of electrical resistance is greater for iron than for other metals, and that recalescence
  occurs at the critical temperature.
