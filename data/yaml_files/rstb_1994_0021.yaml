tldr: This study investigates honeybees' ability to distinguish pattern orientation
  using a twin-choice Y-maze apparatus. The results show that bees can effectively
  differentiate the orientation of unidirectional patterns, such as stripes and gratings,
  and learn to prefer the orientation associated with a reward. However, they struggle
  with discriminating the orientation of right-angled crosses or plaids. The findings
  suggest that honeybees' visual system analyzes orientation similarly to the mammalian
  cortex, involving at least three orientation-sensitive channels with different preferred
  orientations.
