tldr: This article presents measurements of the thermo-electric powers of alkali metals
  at low temperatures. The authors found that the experimental results do not agree
  with the predictions of the free electron models, which would be negative, of a
  certain magnitude, and linear with temperature. The results suggest that the alkali
  metals have different properties than ideal free electron models.
