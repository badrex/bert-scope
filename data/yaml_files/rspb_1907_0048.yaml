tldr: The authors conducted experiments to find a treatment for trypanosomiasis in
  rats. They tested various substances, including atoxyl, which temporarily eliminated
  trypanosomes from the blood but did not cure the disease. They also tested other
  compounds like arsenic derivatives, but none provided a permanent solution. The
  authors found that atoxyl was the most effective substance, but it needed to be
  combined with other treatments to achieve better results. They discovered that some
  trypanosomes could resist atoxyl, leading to recurring infections. Further research
  is needed to find a more effective treatment for trypanosomiasis.
