tldr: The author proposes an experiment to measure the attraction of hills using astronomical
  observations. The experiment would help illustrate the theory of gravity and provide
  a better understanding of the earth's mass and matter density. The author suggests
  two locations in England for conducting this experiment, one near Pendle-hill and
  the other in a valley between Helwellin and Skidda hills.
