tldr: This article presents a linear modal theory for the dynamics of Vlasov beams,
  which are non-uniform thin-walled beams like ship hulls. The theory, based on the
  Vlasov theory of thin-walled beams, accounts for forced and free vibrations and
  includes orthogonality conditions. It offers an alternative to the modified Timoshenko
  theory and has implications for various areas of structural dynamics, including
  naval architecture.
