tldr: This article examines the assessment of Faraday's electromagnetic induction
  paper of 1831 by referees Samuel Hunter Christie and John Bostock. Their report
  praised the paper and provided a detailed outline of its contents, offering different
  interpretative frameworks and assessments of Faraday's results. The authors discussed
  the significance of the inductive effects and introduced the concept of a "double
  induction" when a piece of iron links the two coils between which induction is taking
  place.
