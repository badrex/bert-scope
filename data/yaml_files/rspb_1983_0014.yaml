tldr: The authors conducted a study on the morphology of rabbit retinal ganglion cells
  using intraretinal injections of horseradish peroxidase. They identified five basic
  morphological ganglion cell classes based on dendritic branching patterns and quantitative
  analysis. These classes have distinct characteristics in terms of soma area, dendritic
  field area, total dendritic length, average dendritic branch angle, and other attributes.
  The study provides insights into the correlations between the structure and function
  of rabbit retinal ganglion cells.
