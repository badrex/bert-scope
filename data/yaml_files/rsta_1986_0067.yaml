tldr: This article discusses the relevance of studying the structure and bonding at
  solid surfaces to understand catalysis. It explores the use of local densities of
  states, surface bonds, and rate processes in the context of adsorption and gas-surface
  dynamics. The author highlights the importance of energy exchange between adsorbates
  and substrates in catalytic reactions and the role of promoters and poisons in affecting
  the activation barriers of chemisorption processes.
