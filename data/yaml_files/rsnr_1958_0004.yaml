tldr: The article discusses the life and work of Roger Joseph Boscovich, a Dalmatian
  scientist who made significant contributions to various fields of science. Boscovich's
  atomic theory, presented in his work "Theoria philosophiae naturalis," proposed
  that all matter is made up of identical point particles with interactions determined
  by a single law. This theory influenced the development of particle theory and demonstrated
  the potential for a single oscillatory interaction law to explain a wide range of
  physical properties.
