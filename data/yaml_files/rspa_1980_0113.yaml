tldr: The authors present a comprehensive theory of surface fluctuations in simple
  fluids, including contributions from capillary waves and density fluctuations. They
  consider a fluid with non-zero surface tension, viscosities, compressibility, and
  thermal conductivity and find that thermal conductivity has a small effect on the
  power spectrum, while compressibility leads to additional continua in the surface
  spectrum. Numerical results for liquid argon and mercury are provided.
