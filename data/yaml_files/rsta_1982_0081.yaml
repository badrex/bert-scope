tldr: This article investigates the Earth's core and its magnetic field by analyzing
  lava flows in Hawaii. The researchers found that the geomagnetic secular variation
  in the Pacific region is influenced by the Earth's core. They also discuss the limitations
  of their study and the potential for future research.
