tldr: Stephen Robert Nockolds was a prominent geologist and geochemist who made significant
  contributions to the understanding of igneous petrology and trace element geochemistry.
  His research focused on the interactions between granitoid magmas and country rocks,
  and he developed the concept of reciprocal reaction to explain the chemical evolution
  of silicate magmas. Nockolds' work challenged the transformist school of thought
  and paved the way for new insights into the formation of intermediate rock types.
