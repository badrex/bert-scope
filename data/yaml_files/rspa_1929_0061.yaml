tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the behavior of a single zinc crystal
  under alternating torsional stresses. They found that the crystal deformed by slipping
  on specific planes, and the presence of twins was revealed by surface markings.
  The experiment showed that the crystal could endure millions of stress cycles without
  significant distortion or damage.
