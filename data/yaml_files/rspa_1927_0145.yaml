tldr: The author studied the intensity distribution among the lines of the hydrogen
  molecule spectrum and discovered a definite alternation of intensity in the successive
  lines. They found that the ratio of intensities between odd-numbered lines was approximately
  three times the intensity of the intervening even-numbered lines. This observation
  was supported by data from various bands and initial states, suggesting that this
  ratio was a general feature of the hydrogen spectrum.
