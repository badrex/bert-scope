tldr: The author examines the structure and presence of the median eye in Sphenodon
  and other lizards, also known as the pineal eye. They find that this eye is an invertebrate-like
  structure widely distributed among Lacertilians. The pineal eye is connected to
  the brain via a medianly placed nerve, and its presence and structure provide insights
  into the evolution of the eye and its various functions.
