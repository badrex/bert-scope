tldr: Professor Stokes developed a method to study the change of refrangibility of
  light and fluorescence using simple apparatus. The method can be applied by chemists
  to differentiate between substances. Stokes also discovered that fluorescence can
  be detected even in weakly fluorescent objects and opened a new field of inquiry
  in relation to the polarization of fluorescent light.
