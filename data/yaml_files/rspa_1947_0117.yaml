tldr: The authors conducted a study on the discharge currents associated with kite
  balloons and their impact on atmospheric electricity. They observed that charges
  of the order of coulombs are transferred between balloon cables and the air through
  currents ranging from milliamperes to kiloamperes. The findings provide valuable
  insights into the distribution of charges in clouds and the protection of balloons
  during thunderstorms.
