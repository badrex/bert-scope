tldr: The article examines the functional anatomy of the mantle complex and columellar
  muscle in tectibranch molluscs, focusing on their role in the evolution of opisthobranch
  organization. The study investigates various species, including Philine and Scaphander,
  and discusses how adaptations related to infaunal life, such as changes in the mantle
  complex and columellar muscle, led to the development of nudibranch forms.
