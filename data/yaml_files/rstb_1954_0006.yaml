tldr: The study investigates the lactation cycle and mammary gland development in
  Elephantulus myurus jamesoni, a small mammal. The research shows that the development
  of mammary glands is influenced by pregnancy and lactation overlap, with the presence
  of developing embryos affecting involution. The findings provide insights into the
  reproductive cycle and mammary gland development in this species.
