tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the fluctuations in a tidal current
  and their relationship with surface waves. They observed that the current fluctuations
  and wave periods were of the same order, and the amplitude of the pressure oscillations
  showed no significant dependence on the mean current. The study also found that
  the rate of attenuation of wave amplitudes with depth was consistent with theoretical
  predictions. The authors discuss the challenges in analyzing the data, such as the
  presence of multiple wave periods and the inability to make simultaneous observations
  at different depths.
