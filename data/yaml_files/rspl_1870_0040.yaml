tldr: This article discusses the solution to linear differential equations and presents
  measurements of specific inductive capacity of dielectrics. The author describes
  the instruments and processes used in a series of experiments on the specific inductive
  capacity of various materials, including the effect of varying temperature on the
  capacity.
