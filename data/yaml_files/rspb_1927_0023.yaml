tldr: The author demonstrates the transformation of the Golgi apparatus in tissue
  culture cells. They show that the Golgi apparatus changes form as cells spread out
  on the surface of the cover-glass. The transformation involves the stretching and
  dispersal of the Golgi material, which can eventually lead to the formation of fatty
  or lipoidal droplets. This research provides insight into the behavior of the Golgi
  apparatus in altered cellular conditions.
