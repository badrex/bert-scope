tldr: The author discusses the evolutionary connections of the ancient fish group,
  Dipnoi, to other fish and amphibians. They suggest that Dipnoi are the isolated
  survivors of an ancient group, closely related to Elasmobranchs and ancient Selachian
  types. The author also notes the specializations in Dipnoi due to changes in their
  habits.
