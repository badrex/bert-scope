tldr: The authors propose a new index called the "eusociality index" to quantify the
  level of eusociality in animal societies. Eusociality refers to animal societies
  where some individuals forego direct reproduction to help others reproduce. The
  eusociality index measures the decrease in direct reproduction of group members
  due to altruistic acts directed towards other members. This index complements the
  reproductive skew index, which only considers the reproductive division of labor,
  by also taking into account the amount of alloparental help provided by individuals
  in a society.
