tldr: The author explains the significance of electrode potential and its relation
  to metal basigenity. They introduce the concept of electron affinity and use it
  to derive a formula that connects electrode potential with the basigenic properties
  of metals. The study of electrode potential and its relation to metal properties
  can help improve our understanding of electrochemical processes and the behavior
  of metals in various environments.
