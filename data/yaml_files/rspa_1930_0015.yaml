tldr: The authors studied the spectrum of silicon hydride and found it to consist
  of an isolated group of lines extending from 4100 to 4200. They also discovered
  that the band is degraded to the red and has one well-marked head. The lines have
  a wide spacing characteristic of hydride spectra, and lines due to vibrational transitions
  have been identified. The band is very much fainter than the band.
