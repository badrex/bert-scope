tldr: This article discusses the dispersion of pollutants in the atmosphere by large-scale
  wind systems. The author investigates the travel and dispersion of pollutants using
  tracer materials such as water vapor, ozone, and radioactive substances. The study
  focuses on the role of macroturbulence in the dispersion of pollutants and the use
  of numerical models to predict and analyze the dispersion patterns. The author also
  highlights the limitations of current methods and suggests improvements for future
  research.
