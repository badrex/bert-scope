tldr: The author examines the electromagnetic fields generated by an electric point
  charge moving with acceleration. By applying a limiting process to a special case
  of acceleration, the author derives the Bondi-Gold solution, which demonstrates
  how the electromagnetic field tends to zero in certain zones and forms a shock wave
  in another zone. This solution is shown to be a smooth limit of the Das solution,
  providing a satisfying explanation for the physical significance of permanent uniform
  acceleration.
