tldr: The author, J.M. Ferrall, describes a fibrous tunic called the tunica vaginalis
  oculi that insulates and protects the eye-ball from the pressure of its muscles
  while they are in action. This tunic allows the eye's recti muscles to give rotatory
  motions without causing retraction or injury to the eye. The tunic is perforated
  by six openings for the tendons of the muscles to emerge and play their course.
