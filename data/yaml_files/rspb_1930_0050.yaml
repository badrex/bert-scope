tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the
  anterior pituitary gland and gonads, specifically focusing on ovulation and corpus
  luteum formation. They found that extracts from urine of pregnant women and anterior
  pituitary tissue could induce ovulation in rabbits. The study also showed that a
  corpus luteum develops automatically after ovulation, indicating that a second stimulus,
  previously thought to be dependent on copulation, is not necessary for corpus luteum
  formation.
