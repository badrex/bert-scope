tldr: Researchers have developed a new method to measure the oxidation of fats and
  the effect of light on the process. They found that even weak light can accelerate
  fat oxidation, making it essential to control light exposure to preserve food quality.
  The study also suggests that the potential storage life of fatty products may be
  affected by the methods used in their manufacture.
