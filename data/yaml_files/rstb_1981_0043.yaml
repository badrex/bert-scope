tldr: The article discusses the use of polyploidy in plant breeding, focusing on interspecies
  hybrids and allopolyploidy. It explains the benefits of polyploidy in developing
  race and species hybrids, and the importance of chromosome number and breeding system
  in successful plant breeding programs. The authors also explore the potential of
  polyploidy in breeding for agronomic flexibility in grasses, specifically in Lolium
  and Festuca species.
