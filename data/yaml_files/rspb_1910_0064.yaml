tldr: The authors discovered a new trypanosome species, T. rhodesiense, in a case
  of sleeping sickness. This trypanosome has a unique morphology, with some forms
  having the nucleus at the posterior end. The authors also found that this strain
  is more virulent to rats and guinea-pigs than the old laboratory strain of T. gambiense
  and is resistant to atoxyl. The new trypanosome species was found in a patient who
  had never been in a Glossina palpalis area, raising questions about the transmission
  of the disease.
