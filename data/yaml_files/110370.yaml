tldr: John Bishop's study of a patient with paralysis of the fifth pair of nerves
  demonstrates that the senses of smell and vision can function independently of these
  nerves, while the sense of taste is derived from them. This research supports Sir
  Charles Bell's views on the physiology of sensory nerves.
