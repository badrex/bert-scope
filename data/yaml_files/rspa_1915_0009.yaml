revised_title: Spectral Analysis of Ordinary Lead and Radioactive Lead
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Spectroscopy
semantic_tags:

- Lead
- Radioactivity
tldr: This article compares the spectra of ordinary lead and lead of radioactive origin.
  The authors find that the spectra are identical, with no significant differences
  in wavelength observed. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that isotopes would
  have different spectra based on their atomic weight differences.
