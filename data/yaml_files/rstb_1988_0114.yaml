tldr: The article discusses the role of the mammalian Y chromosome in sex determination.
  The author proposes a new model in which the Y chromosome acts cell-autonomously
  to bring about Sertoli-cell differentiation, suggesting that sex determination is
  equivalent to Sertoli-cell determination. The findings of Page et al. (1987) support
  this model, as their research identified a candidate testis-determining sequence
  on the human Y chromosome, which is compatible with either of the models presented
  in the article.
