tldr: The author, Samuel Haughton, conducted experiments to understand the force of
  contraction of muscles and the strength of tendons in animals. He found that the
  force of contraction of muscles per square inch is relatively consistent across
  different muscles and limbs. Haughton also discovered that the cross sections of
  muscles and their tendons are directly proportional, supporting the principle of
  economy of force in nature.
