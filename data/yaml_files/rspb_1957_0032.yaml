tldr: The author examines the formation of papillae on bacterial colonies and investigates
  the factors that influence their development. They find that papillae form in large,
  aging colonies and are not necessarily a result of drug-resistant mutants. The study
  suggests that environmental factors, such as nutrient depletion and toxic substances,
  play a significant role in papilla formation.
