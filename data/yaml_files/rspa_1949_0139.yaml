tldr: The authors studied the acceleration of hydrogen and oxygen deposition by light
  on various electrodes. They determined the quantum efficiency of the photoreaction
  as a function of the incident light's wavelength and steady polarizing current.
  The results suggest that the rate-determining step occurs after the discharge of
  ions, and the overpotential is due to the stationary concentration of adsorbed atoms
  or radicals at the electrode surface.
