tldr: The author investigates the propagation of earthquake motion and identifies
  three distinct phases or periods of disturbance. They suggest that these phases
  represent the arrival of the condensational and distortional waves, which have traveled
  through the Earth, and surface undulations of long period that have traveled around
  the Earth's surface. The study focuses on accurately determining the time intervals
  and distances from the place of origin to understand the forms of wave motion and
  wave-path represented by each phase.
