tldr: The authors conducted X-ray studies on the structure of hair, wool, and related
  fibers to understand the configuration of the keratin molecule and its orientation
  in the biological cell. They discovered that keratin molecules form a flat "polypeptide
  grid" and found that by compressing the fibers, they could change the orientation
  of the molecules, allowing for a better understanding of protein structures and
  the structure of the biological cell.
