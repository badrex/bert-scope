tldr: Dr. Harvey's anatomical account of Thomas Parre, who lived to be 152 years old,
  reveals that despite his advanced age, his body was still very fleshy, and his organs
  were strong and healthy. The cause of his death was attributed to changes in diet
  and air, as he moved from a simple country life to a more luxurious lifestyle in
  London. This case study highlights the importance of maintaining a healthy diet
  and environment for longevity.
