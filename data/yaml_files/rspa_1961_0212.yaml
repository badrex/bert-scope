tldr: The authors investigate the field dependence of the two-phonon spin-lattice
  relaxation in rare-earth salts, considering hyperfine and dipolar fields. They find
  that the relaxation time is affected by spin correlation and off-diagonal terms
  in the dipolar Hamiltonian, which can lead to a deviation from the Van Vleck effective
  internal field approach. The results show that the relaxation time may be temperature-dependent
  and concentration-dependent for both Raman and resonance processes.
