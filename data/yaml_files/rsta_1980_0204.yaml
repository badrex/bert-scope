tldr: This article presents a finite element analysis to study the shapes and stability
  of captive rotating drops. The authors develop an algorithm to calculate equilibrium
  shapes and stability of three-dimensional menisci, focusing on rigidly rotating
  liquid held captive between two parallel, circular, solid faces co-rotating about
  their common axis. The findings have implications for the float-zone process of
  refining molten materials and producing single crystals.
