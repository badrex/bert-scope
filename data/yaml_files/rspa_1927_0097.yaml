tldr: This study investigates the influence of boundary films on the corrosive action
  of metals in contact with electrolytes. The author examines the role of surface
  conditions and oxide films on the reactivity of metals, and how these factors affect
  the rate of corrosion. The research focuses on the electrochemical aspects of corrosion
  and the importance of understanding the properties of boundary films between electrodes
  and electrolytes.
