tldr: The author presents a new approach to the theory of turbulence by introducing
  correlations in the velocity components at two different points and times. This
  approach aims to incorporate phase relationships between Fourier components, which
  are essential for energy exchange in turbulence. The author derives a single equation
  for a scalar function based on the equations of motion and one additional statistical
  hypothesis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of turbulence.
