tldr: 'The author examines the causes of death and how the decline of vital powers
  relates to sleep. They identify two types of causes: those arising from the continuous
  action of powerful stimulants, which induce a diseased condition in the sensory
  system, and those affecting the vital organs, leading to the destruction of circulation
  or assimilatory functions.'
