tldr: This study investigates nitrogen fixation in three English lakes, focusing on
  the role of heterocystous blue-green algae in the process. The research found that
  nitrogen fixation is light-dependent and is positively correlated with the concentration
  of organic nitrogen in the water. The annual contribution of nitrogen fixation by
  planktonic blue-green algae is estimated to be between 0.037 to 0.287 g N m^2, with
  the highest rates occurring in the early stages of eutrophication. Although nitrogen
  fixation by planktonic algae contributes less than 1% of the total nitrogen income
  of these lakes, it may be a significant source of combined nitrogen for the plankton
  at certain times.
