tldr: The article investigates the effect of homogeneous turbulence on material lines
  and surfaces, demonstrating that they tend to lengthen and expand. The author proposes
  a hypothesis that the probability distribution of the distance between two particles
  in the fluid becomes independent of their initial separation as time increases,
  leading to a stationary random function of the distance.
