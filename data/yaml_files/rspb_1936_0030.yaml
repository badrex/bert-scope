tldr: This study investigates the activation of the evocator, a chemical substance
  responsible for inducing development in amphibians. Researchers found that non-inducing
  parts of a gastrula contain the evocator in a masked form. They also discovered
  that respiratory catalysts, such as methylene blue, can raise the respiratory rate
  of isolated ectoderm fragments, potentially activating the evocator and influencing
  development. This research sheds light on the complex processes of amphibian development
  and the role of chemical substances in embryogenesis.
