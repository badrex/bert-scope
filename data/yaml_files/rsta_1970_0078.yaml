tldr: This article presents a nonlinear stability analysis of the freezing process
  of a dilute binary alloy. The study investigates the effects of temperature gradients
  and the rate of solidification on the formation of cellular patterns and dendritic
  structures in the alloy. The research provides insights into the technological importance
  of solidification instabilities and the underlying principles of pattern-forming
  instabilities in dissipative systems.
