tldr: This study investigates the morphometry, ultrastructure, and neuronal organization
  of the angular acceleration receptor system in the statocyst of Octopus vulgaris.
  The research focuses on the crista/cupula system, which is composed of various types
  of hair cells, supporting cells, and neurons. The findings provide a more complete
  understanding of the receptor system, which is essential for further physiological
  experiments and analysis of information processing in the cephalopod statocyst-oculomotor
  system.
