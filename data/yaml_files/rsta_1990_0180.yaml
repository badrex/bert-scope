tldr: The article discusses the use of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) imaging to
  study glucose disposal in normal and diabetic humans. The researchers found that
  muscle glycogen synthesis is the main pathway for glucose disposal in both normal
  and diabetic subjects, and defects in muscle glycogen synthesis play a significant
  role in insulin resistance in non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) patients.
  NMR techniques provide a non-invasive way to measure glycogen concentrations and
  help understand the underlying mechanisms of insulin resistance.
