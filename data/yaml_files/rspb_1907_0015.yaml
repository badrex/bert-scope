tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the combining properties of the thermostable
  opsonins in immune sera. They found that these opsonins are not affected by heating
  and are different from the thermolabile opsonins in normal sera. The authors also
  discovered that treating immune sera with substances that absorb complements has
  a similar effect on the serum as heating, leaving approximately the same amount
  of immune opsonin.
