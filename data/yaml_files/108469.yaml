tldr: The author, W.R. Grove, conducted experiments to study the effect of surrounding
  gases on the ignition of a platinum wire by a voltaic current. The results showed
  that hydrogen had a lesser cooling effect on the ignited wire compared to oxygen
  and other gases. The author also investigated the role of specific heat and conducting
  powers of gases and liquids, concluding that specific heat alone cannot account
  for the observed phenomenon.
