tldr: The author discusses the effect of diminished fluid pressure in rapidly moving
  portions of a fluid, leading to a slight expansion due to the fluid not being perfectly
  incompressible. The author also highlights the importance of experimental illustrations
  in the field of hydro-kinetics, which helps to improve the understanding of those
  who study it mathematically.
