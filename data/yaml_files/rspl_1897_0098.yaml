tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the densities of carbonic oxide,
  carbonic anhydride, and nitrous oxide. They discussed the methods used for gas purification
  and the challenges faced during the experiments. The results provided insights into
  the atomic weights of these gases and their chemical properties.
