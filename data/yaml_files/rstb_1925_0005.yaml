tldr: The authors conducted a geological and physical geography exploration of Chinese
  Tibet during the Percy Sladen expedition in 1922. They studied the mountainous highlands
  of south-western China, Chinese Tibet, and northeastern Burma, focusing on the geological
  structure and the interaction of mountain movements from two distant periods. The
  research aimed to understand the mountain structure of Chinese Tibet and the development
  of its physiography, providing valuable insights into the region's geology and geography.
