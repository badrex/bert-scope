tldr: The authors engineered resistance against potato virus X and fungi in commercial
  potato cultivars using genetic engineering technology. They achieved this by expressing
  viral coat protein genes and antifungal proteins in transgenic plants. Four years
  of field trials demonstrated the commercial feasibility of improving potato cultivars
  by selectively adding new traits while preserving their intrinsic properties.
