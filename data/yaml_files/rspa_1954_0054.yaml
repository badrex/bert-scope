tldr: The author presents an explicit formula for calculating fractional parentage
  coefficients in nuclear and atomic physics, without the use of group theory. The
  formula is derived for particles in equivalent states with j-j or L-S coupling and
  can be applied to various situations, simplifying the calculation process.
