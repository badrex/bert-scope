tldr: The authors developed a double-beam method for measuring temperature changes
  in shock waves using the sodium-line reversal technique. This method allows for
  more accurate temperature determination by comparing the absorption and emission
  of sodium lines in two separate light beams. The technique uses interference filters
  to isolate the sodium wavelength, improving sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio.
  This advancement enables the study of temperature history behind shock waves and
  provides insights into molecular processes and relaxation times.
