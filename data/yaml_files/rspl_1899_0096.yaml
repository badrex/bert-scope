tldr: This article presents a new method for calculating the correlation of characters
  not quantitatively measurable, such as coat color in horses and eye color in humans.
  The author uses a simple differential relation to expand the coefficients of correlation
  and create a symbolic operator that converts an uncorrelated surface of frequency
  into a correlated surface with coefficients of arbitrary values. The author also
  introduces new functions called "-functions" that satisfy a difference equation
  and can be used to calculate the volume of a frequency surface.
