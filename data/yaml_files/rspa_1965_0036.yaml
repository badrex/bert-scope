tldr: This article explores the use of nuclear electron double resonance (NDER) in
  liquids to study molecular interactions and dynamics. The authors demonstrate how
  NDER can improve signal-to-noise ratios in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and
  provide valuable information for chemists. They also discuss the potential of NDER
  in understanding complex systems with multiple distinguishable nuclear resonances
  and various coupling mechanisms.
