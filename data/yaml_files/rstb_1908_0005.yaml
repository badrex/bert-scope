tldr: The author examines the colour sensations of several hundred people, including
  cases of colour-blindness, to establish a standard of normal colour sensations.
  They discuss the importance of a test that eliminates questions of nomenclature
  and judgments of the mind, focusing on the consciousness of a difference in colour
  perception. The author also explores the differences in colour perception between
  normal vision and colour-blind individuals, and the impact of fatigue on colour
  sensations.
