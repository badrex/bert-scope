tldr: This article discusses the Karlsruhe Conference of 1860 and the role of Stanislao
  Cannizzaro in shaping the field of chemistry. Cannizzaro's lectures on atomic and
  molecular theory had a significant impact on the conference, but the event ultimately
  failed to reach a consensus due to disagreements between attendees. The article
  highlights the importance of Cannizzaro's work and its influence on the development
  of modern chemistry.
