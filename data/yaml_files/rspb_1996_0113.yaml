tldr: This study examines the effects of nutrition and encounter rates with males
  on female fertility, lifespan, and the cost of mating in Drosophila melanogaster.
  The research finds that female remating frequency increases with nutrition and is
  higher with continuous exposure to males. Age-specific and lifetime egg production
  increase with increasing nutrition, but lifespan peaks at an intermediate nutrition
  level. The findings suggest that remating frequencies in laboratory cultures may
  evolve to a low enough level for the cost of mating to be only weakly expressed,
  and further data is needed to assess the importance of this cost in natural populations.
