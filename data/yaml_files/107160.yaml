tldr: The author investigates the role of sap in tree growth and circulation. They
  discover that the sap, stored in the alburnum during winter, is used to nourish
  leaves and buds. The author also suggests that this stored sap plays a role in the
  tree's ability to assimilate nutrients and grow, supporting the idea of vegetable
  circulation.
