tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, explores the formation and properties of triatomic
  ammonias, specifically diethylene-triamine and triethylene-triamine. These compounds
  form various salts and can be used to create platinum and gold compounds. The triatomic
  ammonias are similar to diethylene-alcohol and are part of a series of increasing
  atomicity.
