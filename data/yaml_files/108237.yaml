tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of light polarization when viewed in
  focus, specifically the apparent new polarity observed by Sir David Brewster. Using
  the wave theory of light, the author explains how the spectrum's bands are formed
  and reconciles conflicting statements about the phenomenon. The study provides a
  deeper understanding of light behavior and its applications in optics and spectroscopy.
