tldr: 'This article discusses three aspects of high-energy solar particles: transport
  processes along magnetic flux tubes, solar longitudinal dependence of intensity
  profiles, and charge composition measurements. The authors explore how these aspects
  provide information on particle motion in the corona, the large-scale coronal magnetic
  structure, and the composition and ionization state of the acceleration region.
  They also analyze the physics behind particle transport, including diffusion, acceleration,
  and the interplay between magnetic and electric fields.'
