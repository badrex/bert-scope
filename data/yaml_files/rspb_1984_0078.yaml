tldr: Researchers discovered that adult newts can regrow axons from misrouted nerves
  to their correct muscles in the limb. The study analyzed the regrowth process over
  12 weeks using light and electron microscopy, electrophysiology, and nerve fiber
  tracking with cobalt chloride. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms
  of specific nerve regeneration in urodele amphibians and may have implications for
  understanding nerve regeneration in humans.
