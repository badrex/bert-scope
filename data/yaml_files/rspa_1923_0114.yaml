tldr: The authors conducted experiments on carbon dioxide at various pressures and
  temperatures to study the molecular scattering of light. They used sealed glass
  bulbs and a custom-built apparatus to measure the scattering power and depolarization
  of light in different states of carbon dioxide. The results supported the Einstein-Smoluchowski
  theory of scattering and provided insights into the behavior of light scattering
  in gases and liquids.
