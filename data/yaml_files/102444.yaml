tldr: The author presents a general method for determining the quadratures of curvilinear
  spaces by finding another curve-line from the known property of its tangent, which
  he calls the quadratrix. He divides the method into two parts, treating spaces with
  geometric and mechanical quadratrices. The author also discusses the analytical
  expression of quadratures, the determination of solid places, and the comparison
  of areas of figures with simple figures of the same kind.
