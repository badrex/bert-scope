tldr: The authors study the thermal economy of a decaying plasma, focusing on plasmas
  that are magnetically confined, so only atoms can strike the containing walls. They
  discuss the complex of interacting collisional and radiative processes involved
  in collisional-radiative recombination and ionization. The authors also examine
  the energy balance equations for the hydrogen ion and hydrogen atom gases, considering
  the effects of elastic collisions and inelastic collisions on the energy balance.
