tldr: This article investigates the wavy vortices in the flow between two long eccentric
  rotating cylinders using linear theory. The analysis focuses on the occurrence of
  Coles' wavy vortices when no Taylor vortex flow is present, with a small eccentricity
  and a very small clearance ratio. The results are compared with experimental findings,
  showing a qualitative similarity but differing in magnitude due to the absence of
  nonlinear effects. The study extends previous research on concentric rotating cylinders
  and provides insights into the behavior of wavy vortices in eccentric systems.
