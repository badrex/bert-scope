tldr: This article investigates the non-renormalizability of Einstein-spontaneous-symmetry
  breaking vector and scalar meson interaction. The authors calculate all one-loop
  divergences for charged scalar and vector mesons interacting with each other and
  the quantized gravitational field. They show that these divergences do not cancel
  among themselves on or off-mass-shell, concluding that unified models of this nature
  have been unsuccessful in solving the problem of non-renormalizability of the gravitational
  field.
