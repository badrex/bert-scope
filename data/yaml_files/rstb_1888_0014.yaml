tldr: The author examines the structure and development of the wing in the common
  fowl, focusing on the carpus and its elements. They find that the two persistent
  carpals in the bird's wing, the intermedio-radiale and centralo-ulnare, are compound
  structures containing remnants of other bones. The study also traces the development
  of the three metacarpal bones and the distal phalanges, providing insights into
  the wing's structure and evolution.
