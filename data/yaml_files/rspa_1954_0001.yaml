tldr: This paper presents a mathematical theory for the flow of a gas in a porous
  solid and the associated temperature distributions. The author considers the heat
  transfer between the gas and solid, taking into account the conductivity of the
  solid and the gas velocity. The study provides a foundation for understanding and
  designing heat exchangers and cooling systems, such as'sweat cooling' used in gas
  turbines.
