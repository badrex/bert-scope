tldr: The author discusses the properties of colloidal systems and the role of adsorption
  in heterogeneous reactions. Adsorption is the process where substances accumulate
  at the interface between two phases in a system, and it plays a crucial role in
  the rate of chemical reactions. The author explains the stages of heterogeneous
  reactions, including diffusion, adsorption, and chemical reaction, and provides
  examples of colloidal systems and adsorption compounds.
