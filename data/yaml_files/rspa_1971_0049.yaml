tldr: This article compares the conventional quantum mechanical hamiltonian for molecular
  systems interacting with the electromagnetic field to an alternative multipole interaction.
  The authors analyze the unitary transformation connecting the two hamiltonians and
  examine the problem of displaying the binding energies of molecular systems. They
  derive the hamiltonian and discuss its implications, including the importance of
  gauge conditions and the role of arbitrary coefficients in the theory.
