tldr: The author, Captain F. W. Beechey, conducted observations on the tidal streams
  of the English Channel and North Sea under the authority of the Admiralty in 1849
  and 1850. He found that the tidal streams in these areas corresponded in every important
  aspect and were influenced by a combined wave. The study provides a better understanding
  of tidal phenomena and can be useful for navigation, as it offers a common standard
  for referring to the movement of the stream.
