tldr: This article discusses the discovery of coesite and other high-pressure minerals
  in the western Alps, suggesting that continental crust can be buried to depths of
  around 100 km during subduction. The findings provide evidence for the subduction
  of continental crust and the conditions experienced during regional metamorphism.
