tldr: This article describes an experiment conducted by Lord Kelvin, Magnus Maclean,
  and Alexander Galt to investigate the diselectrification of air that has been electrified.
  They used a new experimental arrangement to test the efficiency of filters and other
  appliances in reducing the electrification of air. The authors found that cotton-wool
  between the spaces in the groups of wire gauzes increased the diselectrifying effect,
  but they still aimed to find more effective methods of achieving complete diselectrification.
