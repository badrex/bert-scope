tldr: The authors explore weak solutions of the massless field equations, focusing
  on their extensions to hyperfunctions. They demonstrate that distribution solutions
  can be expressed as the sum of future and past analytic solutions, and show that
  any hyperfunction solution of the massless field equations on Minkowski space has
  a hyperfunction extension to compactified Minkowski space that is also a solution.
  This work is important for understanding the relationship between distribution solutions,
  conformal invariance, and positive frequency in the context of massless field equations.
