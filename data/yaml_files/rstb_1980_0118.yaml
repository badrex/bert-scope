revised_title: 'Neutron Scattering in Incommensurate Structures: Displacive Instabilities
  and Soft Mode Theories'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Condensed Matter Physics
semantic_tags:
- Incommensurate structures
- Neutron scattering
- Soft mode instabilities
- Charge density waves
- Phonon softening
tldr: This article reviews recent neutron scattering studies of incommensurate structures
  and their displacive phase transformations. It discusses the concept of soft phonons
  and their role in instabilities within periodic crystalline structures. The article
  also explores the behavior of charge density waves and phonon softening in quasi-one-dimensional
  and quasi-two-dimensional metals, as well as in insulators.
