tldr: The authors conducted an intermediate coupling calculation for nuclei of mass
  18 and 19, taking into account configurational mixing and the effects of spin-orbit
  forces. They found that the even-parity levels of these nuclei can be understood
  in terms of single-particle levels with a large spin-orbit splitting. The mode of
  coupling is closer to -coupling than to jj-coupling, and the calculations suggest
  that both configurational mixing and intermediate coupling are essential for a proper
  understanding of these nuclei.
