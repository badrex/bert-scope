tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of magnesium hydride and its relation
  to sunspots. They confirmed the presence of magnesium hydride in the sunspot spectrum
  and demonstrated that its flutings, along with titanium oxide and calcium hydride,
  support the idea that sunspots are regions of reduced temperature. The study also
  found that many of the faint lines in the solar spectrum are not due to magnesium
  hydride.
