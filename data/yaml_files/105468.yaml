tldr: Dr. John Hope, a professor of medicine and botany, received seeds of Rheum palmatum
  from Dr. Mounsey and successfully grew the plant in his botanic garden. He found
  that the root had the smell, taste, and purgative qualities of true rhubarb. The
  plant's similarity to the best foreign rhubarb led to the expectation of it being
  an important acquisition for Britain.
