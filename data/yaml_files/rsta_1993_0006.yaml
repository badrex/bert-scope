tldr: The article discusses the use of radioactive disequilibria in volcanic rocks
  to understand the chemistry and timescale of magma genesis. It explores the effects
  of partial melting, the attainment of chemical and isotopic equilibrium, and the
  presence of a vapor phase during melting. The study focuses on the enrichment of
  230Th with respect to 238U in various magmas and the implications for the melting
  processes and transfer times between the source and the eruption site.
