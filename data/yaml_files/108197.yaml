tldr: The author examines the relationship between the dispersion of light and polarization,
  focusing on the wave theory of light. They discuss the conditions necessary for
  elliptically polarized light and how it relates to plane-polarized and unpolarized
  light. The author also explains the mathematical formulas and equations involved
  in understanding these phenomena.
