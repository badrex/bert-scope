tldr: The author, Mr. Bradley, observed the movement and position of a comet in relation
  to nearby stars. By measuring the distances and angles between the comet and stars,
  he determined the comet's right ascension and declination. These observations provided
  valuable data for understanding the comet's trajectory and helped confirm the accuracy
  of the theory of gravity.
