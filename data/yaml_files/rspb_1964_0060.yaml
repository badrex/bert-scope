tldr: The author discusses the physical and chemical basis of muscular contraction,
  focusing on the role of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) breakdown during single muscle
  contractions. They found that ATP is the primary energy source for muscle contraction
  and that the breakdown of ATP is directly related to the external work done during
  the contraction process. The author also discovered that the breakdown of ATP can
  be reversed during muscle stretching, which has implications for understanding the
  biophysics of muscle contractions.
