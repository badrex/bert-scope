tldr: Miners' nystagmus is an eye condition that affects coal miners, causing a rotatory
  oscillation of the eyeballs and impairing their vision. The main cause of this condition
  is believed to be the strain of working in poor lighting conditions and maintaining
  an awkward head position. The author suggests that improving lighting in mines and
  adopting safer working practices can help prevent this occupational neurosis.
