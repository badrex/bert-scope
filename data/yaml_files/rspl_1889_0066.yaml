tldr: This article investigates the effects of pressure on the magnetisation of cobalt,
  revealing a critical field where the material's magnetisation changes. The authors
  found that the Villari effect, a cyclic change in magnetisation due to pressure,
  occurs in cobalt, similar to iron. The study also examines the relationship between
  strain and magnetisation, providing insights into the magnetic properties of materials.
