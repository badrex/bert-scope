tldr: This article discusses the use of Meteosat satellite imagery to track weather
  patterns and their potential impact on locust migration. The authors analyze a specific
  weather event in North Africa, which they believe may have transported locust swarms
  from Algeria to Mauritania. They also explore the potential of Meteosat data for
  monitoring weather conditions favorable for locust reproduction and gregarization.
