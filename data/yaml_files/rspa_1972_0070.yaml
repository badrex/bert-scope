tldr: This article explores the microstructure of ionic melts, focusing on molten
  alkali halides, using computer simulation techniques. The authors describe the radial
  distribution functions and fluctuation functions, providing a quantitative analysis
  of the local structure in ionic melts. Their findings challenge the agreement between
  theoretical models and experimental data, suggesting that further improvements are
  needed for a better understanding of molten salt systems.
