tldr: The study investigates the initial stages of deformation in metals subjected
  to repeated liquid impact, focusing on the formation of small plastic depressions
  and the role of surface loading. The research compares the effects of liquid impact
  and hydrodynamic loading conditions due to shock waves in a liquid, and discusses
  the influence of high-velocity liquid flow across the impacted surface.
