tldr: This article investigates the rotatory dispersion in d-spiroheptane-diamine
  and its derivatives. The authors synthesize various compounds and analyze their
  rotatory dispersion data to deduce accurate values for active frequencies. They
  conclude that the assumption of isotropic groups is justified and discuss the significance
  of their findings in relation to amino bases and molecular modeling.
