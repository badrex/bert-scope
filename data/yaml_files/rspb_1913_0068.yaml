tldr: The author explores the possibility of the first step towards the origin of
  life being the synthesis of organic matter from inorganic substances by the agency
  of inorganic colloids acting as transformers or catalysts for radiant solar energy.
  They demonstrate the synthesis of formaldehyde from carbon dioxide and water using
  inorganic colloids, such as hydrated ferric oxide and uranium oxide, under sunlight
  exposure. This process could have played a crucial role in the evolution of life
  on Earth.
