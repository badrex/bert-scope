tldr: The authors describe a method to condense volatile organosilicon compounds,
  hexamethyldisiloxane, and tetramethylsilane, into oligomeric and polymeric products
  using an electrical discharge in an ozonizer-type apparatus. They isolated and characterized
  a series of products using preparative scale gas-liquid chromatography, elemental
  analysis, infrared spectroscopy, and mass spectrometry. The method provides a degree
  of control over the nature of the products, which can be resinous solids, heavy
  oils, or light oils in varying proportions.
