tldr: The author describes the discovery and analysis of Baluchitherium osborni, a
  large, aberrant mammal with elephantine size and unique skeletal features. The animal
  had a heavy body, pillar-like limbs, and a long neck, making it one of the largest
  land mammals known at the time. The author compares its skeletal structure to other
  Perissodactyles, such as horses and rhinoceroses, and discusses the variations in
  its atlas and cervical vertebrae.
