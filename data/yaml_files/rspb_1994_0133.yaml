tldr: Researchers used microsatellites to identify the patrilines and genetic relatedness
  in honeybee colonies. They found that the genetic structure of a colony remains
  largely unchanged over time as long as the same queen leads the colony. This study
  provides a precise assessment of honeybee colony genetics and helps understand the
  social biology of honeybees.
