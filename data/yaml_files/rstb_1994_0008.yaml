tldr: This article compares marine and continental food webs, highlighting the differences
  in biomass density, carbon stocks, and net primary productivity between the two
  ecosystems. Despite the lower number of described species in the oceans, marine
  species interact with more other species than their continental counterparts. The
  article raises questions about the underlying factors and conditions that contribute
  to these differences and the implications for ecosystem function and food web structure.
