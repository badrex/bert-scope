tldr: This study investigates the induction of fertility and pregnancy in the anestrous
  ferret using a combination of evening illumination and gonad-stimulating extracts.
  The researchers found that light treatment and hormone injections can activate the
  reproductive organs of both male and female ferrets, leading to successful pregnancies
  outside the normal breeding season.
