tldr: The authors studied the primary products and processes in the radiolysis of
  2-methyltetrahydrofuran (MTHF) using various spectroscopic techniques. They found
  that the primary products of radiolysis are electrons and positive ions, which undergo
  rapid ion-molecule reactions to form radicals. The electrons can be trapped in the
  glassy MTHF matrix or captured by additives like naphthalene, ferric chloride, carbon
  tetrachloride, nitrous oxide, or trans-stilbene. The study provides insights into
  the nature and kinetics of reactions involving electrons and positive ions in radiolysis.
