tldr: The article explores the effects of dispersal on the stability of host-parasitoid
  systems. It shows that the existence of a "pool" of dispersing hosts and/or parasitoids
  can stabilize population models, even in the absence of spatial heterogeneity in
  birth and death rates. The study considers separate effects of host and parasitoid
  dispersal, and then analyzes the situation when both hosts and parasitoids move
  between patches, concluding that dispersal per se stabilizes the interaction.
