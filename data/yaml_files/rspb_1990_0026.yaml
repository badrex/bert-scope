revised_title: Soybean Root Nodule Bacteroids and the Role of Poly-β-Hydroxybutyrate
  in N2 Fixation

tldr: The study investigates the relationship between the supply of exogenous malate
  or succinate and the accumulation and utilization of poly-β-hydroxybutyrate (PHB)
  by nitrogen-fixing soybean root nodule bacteroids. The results show that during
  the supply of malate and succinate, bacteroids accumulate PHB, which is then used
  as an energy source for enhanced N2 fixation when exogenous substrates are not available.
