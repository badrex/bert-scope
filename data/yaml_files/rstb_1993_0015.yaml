tldr: This article discusses the regulation of human globin gene switching, focusing
  on the role of the Locus Control Region (LCR) and its interactions with specific
  genes. The LCR is responsible for the expression of the human globin genes, and
  its mechanism is studied through natural mutations and experiments in transgenic
  mice. The article highlights the importance of stage-specific transcription factors
  and the LCR's ability to create stable interactions with the genes, leading to position-independent
  expression.
