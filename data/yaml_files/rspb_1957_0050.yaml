tldr: This article discusses the social behavior and organization of honeybee colonies,
  focusing on the factors that attract individual bees to join clusters and the role
  of the queen in maintaining colony cohesion. The study found that scattered worker
  bees are attracted to clusters by a combination of scent, vibration, temperature,
  and sight. Queens play a crucial role in keeping worker bees together, serving as
  a powerful attraction. The attraction to these stimuli is likely an important adaptation
  for social life.
