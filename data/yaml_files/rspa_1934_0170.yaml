tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electron emission and chemical
  reactions of liquid NaK with various gaseous compounds. They analyzed the electronic
  spectra of the reactions and determined the contact potential difference between
  the alloy and surrounding gases. The results helped establish a better understanding
  of the underlying mechanisms and energy distribution in chemical electron emission
  processes.
