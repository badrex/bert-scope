tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on the mechanical properties
  of gelatin films. The authors found that films prepared at higher temperatures have
  lower strength and higher recoverable extension under high relative humidity. They
  also discovered that the rate and degree of drying have a small effect on the tensile
  properties of the films, and the differences caused by these factors are insignificant
  compared to the temperature effect.
