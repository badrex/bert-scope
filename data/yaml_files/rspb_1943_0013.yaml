tldr: The author investigates the transformation of rhipidistian paired fins into
  the primitive tetrapod limb. They propose a new theory that differs from previous
  hypotheses, suggesting that the proto-tetrapod pectoral and pelvic fins had a similar
  structure. The author also introduces the terms archepodium and neopodium to describe
  parts of the tetrapod limb derived from the rhipidistian paddle skeleton and new
  formations, respectively. This new theory helps explain the relationships of the
  radiale (tibiale) in various forms and the development of limbs in living tetrapods.
