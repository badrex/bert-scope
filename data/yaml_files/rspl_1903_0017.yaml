tldr: The authors examine the structure of gold leaf and the absorption spectrum of
  gold. They observe that the black lines in gold leaf are due to minute wires or
  threads of the metal, which are formed during the gold beating process. The study
  also presents the absorption spectrum of gold in various forms, including gold-colored
  glass and reduced solutions of its salts.
