tldr: The authors investigated the mechanism behind the oxygen electrode's irreversibility
  and found that the formation of platinum oxide on the electrode surface is responsible
  for the incomplete reversibility. They also determined that the necessary current
  density decreases with time, which affects the electrode's potential. This study
  provides a better understanding of the oxygen electrode's behavior and its impact
  on the hydrogen-oxygen cell's efficiency.
