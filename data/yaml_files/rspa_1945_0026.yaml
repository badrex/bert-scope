tldr: The authors study the decay of phosphorescence in various materials during the
  first few milliseconds of the process. They provide evidence that short-period phosphorescence
  is primarily due to the time electrons spend in traps, rather than the time they
  take to move through the phosphor. This challenges the bimolecular theory of phosphorescence
  and supports the concept of electron traps in explaining phosphorescence processes.
  The study of phosphorescence decay processes provides information about electronic
  energy levels and the movement of electrons in solid insulators.
