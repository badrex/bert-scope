tldr: The author investigates the metachronal rhythms and gill movements of the nymph
  of Caenis horaria in relation to water flow. They discovered that the gills create
  symmetrical currents in the water, which are essential for the survival of this
  species. The study provides insights into the adaptational significance of these
  unique gill movements and their role in the animal's environment.
