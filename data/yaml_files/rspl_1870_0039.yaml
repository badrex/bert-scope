tldr: The author explains the hydro-kinetic theorem for fluid pressure in abstract
  hydrodynamics and demonstrates its application through experiments involving vibrations
  and a tuning fork. The results show that the average pressure at any point of a
  fluid is equal to a constant diminished by the product of the density into half
  the square of the velocity. This theorem helps to clarify ideas in the field of
  hydrodynamics and offers new experimental illustrations for the study of vibrations.
