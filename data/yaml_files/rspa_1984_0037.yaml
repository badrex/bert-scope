tldr: The authors conducted numerical simulations using the three-dimensional incompressible
  Navier-Stokes equations to study the instability of a flat-plate boundary layer.
  They observed flow field structures similar to those found in the vibrating-ribbon
  experiment and found that the development of strong shear layers and secondary instabilities
  play a significant role in the transition process. The simulations provide insights
  into the first five stages of boundary layer transition, which can help improve
  our understanding of the complex phenomena involved in the transition from laminar
  to turbulent flow.
