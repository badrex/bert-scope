tldr: The article investigates the theory of X-ray diffraction from one-dimensionally
  disordered crystals undergoing a solid-state transformation to the 6H structure
  through a layer displacement mechanism. The authors develop a theory that considers
  the statistical creation of a new structure due to layer displacement faults occurring
  in a specific manner. They predict observable diffraction effects, such as changes
  in integrated intensity, peak shift, integral breadth, and peak asymmetry, which
  can be used to determine the mechanism that actually occurs during the transformation.
