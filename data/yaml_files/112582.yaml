tldr: This article investigates the chemical intensity of direct and diffuse sunlight
  at different altitudes. The authors found that the action of the atmosphere on chemically
  active rays is different from the action on luminous rays. The ratio of chemical
  intensity of direct to diffuse sunlight varies with the transparency and location,
  and it does not correspond to the ratio of visible intensity.
