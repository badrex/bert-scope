tldr: This article discusses the experimental studies of combustion propagation in
  energetic materials, focusing on the application of thermal methods to understand
  heat transfer and chemical kinetics. The authors examine temperature profile analysis
  and thermal analysis techniques, proposing a mathematical model for the propagation
  process and exploring the relationship between burning velocity, heat loss, and
  activation energy.
