tldr: The authors studied the structure of poly-L-alanine fibers in the α-helix form
  using X-ray diffraction and optical diffraction patterns. They found that the chain
  arrangement in the crystal structure is a hexagonal, close-packed array of right-handed
  helices with a random chain sense. This arrangement explains the observed X-ray
  diffraction pattern and supports the right-handed α-helix as the structural unit
  in the crystal of poly-L-alanine.
