tldr: The author observed two parhelia, or mock-suns, in Wittemberg, Saxony, on December
  31, 1735. They described the appearance, colors, and streams associated with the
  parhelia and the atmospheric conditions during the observation. The author also
  mentioned the similarity between their observations and those made in England, suggesting
  a similar state of the atmosphere in both locations.
