tldr: The authors developed kinetic models for the formation of a chemisorbed overlayer
  on a homotattic surface with fourfold symmetry, considering the existence of short-range
  order in the overlayer. They studied the interaction of nitrogen with the {100}
  plane of tungsten using a molecular beam technique and found that the results were
  in quantitative agreement with the kinetic model, allowing for initial trapping
  into a mobile physisorbed state. This work provides a better understanding of adsorption
  kinetics and surface stoichiometry in chemisorption processes.
