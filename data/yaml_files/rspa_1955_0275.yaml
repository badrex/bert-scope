tldr: This article explores the acceleration of cosmic-ray particles by magneto-hydrodynamic
  waves. The author suggests that magnetized gas clouds in the galaxy can act as scatterers,
  allowing cosmic rays to gain energy from these waves. The study provides a potential
  explanation for the origin of cosmic rays and their power-law spectrum.
