tldr: This study examines the fine structure of layers I and II of the somatic sensory
  cortex in cats using electron microscopy. The researchers describe the distinct
  characteristics of neurons, dendrites, and axonal ramifications in each layer, providing
  a foundation for further experimental investigations on the cortical organization
  and extrinsic afferent pathways.
