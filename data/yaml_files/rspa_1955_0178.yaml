tldr: The authors measured the surface resistance and reactance of superconducting
  aluminium at a frequency of 1200. They deduced the penetration depth and found evidence
  of anisotropy. The high-frequency resistance of the superconducting phase showed
  a similar behavior to tin. This study supports the non-local theory of superconductivity
  proposed by Pippard and suggests that further research on other superconductors
  could yield valuable data.
