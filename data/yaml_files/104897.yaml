tldr: This article narrates a case study of a patient with a morbid eye. Despite various
  treatments, the patient's condition worsened, and it was eventually determined that
  the eye had a carcinoma. The patient underwent surgery to remove the eye, and the
  wound was treated with dressings. The patient recovered successfully, and the pain
  from the eye was gone. The article also describes the state of the eye's humors
  before the surgery.
