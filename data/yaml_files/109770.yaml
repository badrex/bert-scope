tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, invented a single-lens micrometer to measure
  small objects accurately. The instrument uses a lens with a focus at one-twelfth
  of an inch and a small perforation for comparing the object with a scale. The micrometer
  has a simple design, appearing like a telescope with three tubes, and can measure
  objects with precision by counting divisions on the scale.
