tldr: The author examines the morphology of fossil diatom species in the Tetracyclus
  genus, focusing on the 'ellipticus' species group. They find that the elliptical
  shape of valves is a variable property of ontogeny, and the 'ellipticus' species
  group is not monophyletic. This study contributes to a revision of the entire Tetracyclus
  genus and its implications for understanding stratigraphic and biogeographical distribution.
