tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the electromagnetic energy of a point
  charge and its equations of motion in the context of relativistic mechanics. They
  propose a finite expression for the energy, which is consistent with the principle
  of energy conservation and can be used in both classical and quantum electrodynamics.
