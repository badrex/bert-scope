tldr: The authors conducted precision measurements of the angular dependence of the
  de Haas-van Alphen frequencies in noble metals, focusing on copper, silver, and
  gold. They used the data to compute analytical representations of the Fermi surfaces
  in the form of Fourier expansions, achieving a greater accuracy in the formulae
  for the Fermi surfaces. The computed orientation dependence of Fermi surfaces agreed
  with experimental results, providing valuable information about the properties of
  the Fermi surfaces, such as the density of states and electronic specific heat.
