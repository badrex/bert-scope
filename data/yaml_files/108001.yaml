tldr: The author discovered that soft iron can retain magnetism even when not under
  the influence of an electric current. They conducted experiments with soft iron
  horseshoes and copper wire coils, finding that the soft iron could hold a magnetic
  state for an extended period. This challenges the common belief that only hardened
  steel has the ability to retain magnetism.
