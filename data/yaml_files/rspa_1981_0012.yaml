tldr: The authors studied the martensitic transformation in f.c.c. manganese alloys
  using ultrasonics and neutron scattering. They found that as the manganese content
  increases, severe elastic anomalies develop in these materials, leading to a cubic-to-tetragonal
  martensitic transformation. The study also revealed unusual inter-atomic forces
  and phonon softening in the alloys, which are a consequence of an enhanced electron-phonon
  interaction. The findings provide insights into the properties of these materials
  and their potential applications.
