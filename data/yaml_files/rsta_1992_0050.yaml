tldr: The authors present a theory for super-resolution electron microscopy using
  Wigner-distribution deconvolution. This method allows for retrieving the phase of
  the entire scattered wavefield, overcoming the resolution limit of the electron
  microscope. The technique is noise-robust and can handle partial coherence in the
  source and specimen thickness, making it a promising experimental approach.
