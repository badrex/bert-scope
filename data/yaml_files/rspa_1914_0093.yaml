tldr: The authors conducted a study to accurately measure the wavelengths of hydrogen
  lines using a 10-foot concave grating. They aimed to test Balmer's formula and improve
  the precision of the measurements. The study found that the hydrogen spectrum is
  unique and useful for checking the accuracy of other spectral lines. The authors
  also discussed the conditions and techniques used in their experiment, such as using
  a continuous flow of hydrogen gas and employing tertiary standard wave-lengths for
  better accuracy.
