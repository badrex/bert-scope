tldr: This study investigates the optimization of cracked composite laminates to minimize
  delamination. By analyzing the stress intensity factor and interfacial stresses,
  the authors propose an optimization problem to choose the ply angle, relative ply
  stiffness, and thickness to reduce the risk of delamination in fiber-reinforced
  composites. The results show that minimizing the crack driving force in the layer
  and avoiding delamination is possible through a judicious choice of design variables.
