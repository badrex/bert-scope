tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of nitrate-nitrogen on
  the nodule symbioses of Coriaria and Hippophae plants. They found that plant growth
  was promoted by the supplied nitrogen, but nodule growth and nitrogen fixation per
  plant were depressed. The study provides insights into the role of nitrate-nitrogen
  in nodule symbioses and its implications for the biosphere.
