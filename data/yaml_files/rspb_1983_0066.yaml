tldr: The authors studied the morphology and function of neurons in locust brain and
  suboesophageal ganglion involved in initiating and maintaining walking. They used
  extracellular staining through a stimulating electrode to visualize the neurons
  and found that primary sensory fibers, particularly those in the dorsal tegumentary
  nerve, were often stained. The results provide insights into the structural substrate
  that transmits signals for walking between the head ganglia and the thorax.
