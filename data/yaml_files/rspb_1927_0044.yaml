tldr: The authors investigate the intracellular oxidation-reduction potential and
  its importance in cellular processes. They discuss the relationship between hydrogen
  liberation and its disappearance, and how this potential is maintained within the
  cell. The study highlights the role of oxidation-reduction potential in the synthesis
  of alanin and the importance of molecular oxygen in cellular respiration. The authors
  also explore the use of indicators to measure intracellular potential and the role
  of carriers like glutathione in oxidation processes.
