tldr: This study investigates the effects of the Tail-short (Ts) gene mutation on
  mice, which causes shorter tails and smaller bodies. The research reveals various
  skeletal abnormalities and anaemia in Ts heterozygous mice, which can be traced
  back to deficiencies in blood islands in the yolk sac of 8-day embryos. The primary
  effect of the gene is suggested to be anaemia, which leads to differential retardation
  of various organs and results in the observed abnormalities.
