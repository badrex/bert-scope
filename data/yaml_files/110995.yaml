tldr: The author, John Tudor, discusses the importance of proper compass adjustment
  and the use of compensating magnets to counteract local attraction in maintaining
  accurate navigation, especially in iron vessels. He shares his experience with the
  compasses on board the Pluto and emphasizes the need for uniformity in compass size,
  needle size, and bittacle height. Tudor also debunks the myth that adjustments for
  local attraction in northern latitudes are not correct when the ship is south of
  the equator.
