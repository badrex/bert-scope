tldr: This article analyzes the shape and stability of captive rotating drops influenced
  by multiple parameters, such as drop volume, drop length, and gravitational Bond
  number. The authors use asymptotic and computer-aided techniques from bifurcation
  theory to study the Young-Laplace equation that governs meniscus shape. They find
  that changes in these parameters can alter the connectivity of equilibrium families
  and affect the stability of the menisci. The study compares numerical and asymptotic
  results to predict the stability and behavior of rotating captive drops.
