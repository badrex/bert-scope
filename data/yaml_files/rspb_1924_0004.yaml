tldr: The author's study of sea urchins in Suez found a lunar periodicity in their
  reproductive cycle, with gonads growing and shedding sexual products in correlation
  with the lunar month. This research debunked a common belief in Mediterranean countries
  that the size of marine invertebrates varied with the phases of the moon.
