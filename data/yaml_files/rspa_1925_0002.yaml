tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of total internal reflection and demonstrates
  that it can be explained as a combination of diffraction and refraction. By analyzing
  the flow of energy in the vicinity of the critical angle, the author resolves the
  apparent paradox of energy transmission and provides a deeper understanding of light
  behavior at the interface between two media.
