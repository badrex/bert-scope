tldr: 'The study investigates the effect of visual deprivation on the basal dendrites
  of Meynert cells in the striate cortex of monkeys. The researchers found that visual
  deprivation led to changes in the dendritic fields of Meynert cells, with two distinct
  types of abnormal dendritic fields: ''lop-sided'' and ''perpendicular''. The proportion
  of these abnormal cells increased with longer durations of eyelid closure, suggesting
  a correlation with changes in the width of ocular dominance bands.'
