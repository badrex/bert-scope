tldr: The authors study the dependence of surface wave frequencies in a canal on the
  curvature of its cross-sectional shape. They derive an equation for the coefficient
  of the large eigenvalues and test its accuracy by calculating eigenvalues for a
  semicircular canal. The results provide insight into the behavior of surface waves
  in canals with different cross-sectional curvatures.
