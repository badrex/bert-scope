tldr: The author discusses the concept of modular organisms, which grow by repeating
  units of structure, and how they may be influenced by natural selection differently
  than unitary organisms. Modular growth allows exponential increase in size and may
  explain the absence of senescence in the genetic individual (genet). The author
  also mentions a Royal Society Discussion meeting on the growth and form of modular
  organisms.
