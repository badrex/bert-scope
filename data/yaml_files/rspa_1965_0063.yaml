tldr: The authors investigate the photodecomposition of lead iodide and discover that
  visible light creates excitons, which are mobile and interact with lattice defects
  to cause chemical decomposition. They propose a mechanism where two excitons react
  at a preferred site to produce iodine, anion vacancies, and a lead atom. This process
  has potential applications in image recording and high-resolution photography.
