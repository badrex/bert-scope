tldr: The author, Samuel Solly, investigates the connection between the anterior columns
  of the spinal cord and the cerebellum in humans, horses, and sheep. He demonstrates
  that the corpora pyramidalia are only half composed of the anterior columns and
  identifies another portion called the antero-lateral column. Solly suggests that
  these columns are involved in both voluntary and involuntary movements and that
  the facial and pneumogastric nerves arise from multiple tracts.
