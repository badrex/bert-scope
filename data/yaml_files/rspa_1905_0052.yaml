tldr: This study investigates the influence of phase changes on the tenacity of ductile
  metals at ordinary temperatures and the boiling point of liquid air. The authors
  found that the metals' tenacity is affected by the changes in phase, and the amorphous
  phase is harder than the crystalline phase. They also discovered that the metals'
  maximum tenacity can be achieved when they are in a homogeneous condition.
