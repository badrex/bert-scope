tldr: James Gray was a prominent British biologist who significantly influenced the
  field of biology, particularly in Great Britain, during the first half of the 20th
  century. His work focused on cytology and animal locomotion, and he emphasized the
  importance of functional or experimental zoology. Gray's contributions to the understanding
  of the evolutionary process and his promotion of exact methods in biological research
  have left a lasting impact on the scientific community.
