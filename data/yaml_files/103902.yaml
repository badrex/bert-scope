tldr: The author examines the mammoth bones found in Siberia and argues that they
  belonged to elephants. He also discusses the possibility of the bones being remnants
  of the universal deluge mentioned in the Bible. The author provides evidence from
  various sources and compares the mammoth bones to those found in other countries,
  such as Poland, Germany, Italy, England, and Ireland.
