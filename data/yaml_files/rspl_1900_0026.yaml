tldr: This paper examines the distribution of molecular energy in gases and the effect
  of sound waves on this distribution. The author proposes that the energy of a gas
  will eventually distribute itself equally among its degrees of freedom, but this
  equilibrium may not be reached during the passage of sound waves. The paper also
  suggests that the ratio of specific heats, as determined from indirect experiments
  on sound velocity, may vary with the duration of the experiment. The author proposes
  a solution to this dilemma by considering the gas molecules and the ether as a complete
  dynamical system, with the ether acting as a frictional force on the molecules.
  The paper concludes that the weight of a degree of freedom may vary with temperature
  and that ordinary thermodynamics must break down above the temperature of incandescence.
