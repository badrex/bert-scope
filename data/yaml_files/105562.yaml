tldr: In a letter to James Short, John Winthrop discusses his observations of Venus
  on the Sun and the challenges he faced in determining the precise moments of contact.
  He also calculates the equation of time for the observation and shares his findings
  with Short, hoping that they will be included in the Transactions of the Royal Society.
  Winthrop expresses his gratitude for Short's previous remarks on his work and his
  hope that future generations may benefit from his observations.
