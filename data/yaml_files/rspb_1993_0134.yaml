tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to test the source-and-sink hypothesis,
  which suggests that the separation of soma from germ cells in multicellular organisms
  provides a selective advantage. They used the colonial green algae Volvox carteri
  and found that germ cells grew faster when associated with a soma, and the difference
  in growth rates increased with nutrient concentration. This supports the idea that
  division of labor between soma and germ cells offers a physiological advantage to
  multicellular organisms.
