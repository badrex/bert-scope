tldr: The study investigates the retinal visual fields and a schematic eye model for
  the Humboldt penguin, Spheniscus humboldti. The findings suggest that the penguin's
  eye is aquatic in design, being emmetropic in water and myopic in air. The research
  also reveals that the penguin lacks binocular vision, which is an unexpected property
  for an animal that feeds underwater and whose predators typically attack from below
  the water surface.
