tldr: The authors investigated the structure of certain simple benzene derivatives
  using a new electron diffraction method. They determined the halogen-carbon bond
  distance in these compounds and discussed the carbon-carbon distance in the benzene
  ring. The study aimed to understand if the benzene ring is flat and regular, and
  if the bond distances are constant regardless of the number of substituents.
