tldr: The authors present an actuarial model for forecasting AIDS cases, focusing
  on homosexual transmission. The model is age-specific and allows for variations
  in transition intensities by age, duration in certain states, and calendar year.
  The authors provide numerical results for the population of England and Wales, projecting
  the epidemic's impact up to 2012.
