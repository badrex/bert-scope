tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, studied the reaction between triethylphosphine and
  bisulfide of carbon, resulting in a deep crimson-colored crystalline compound. This
  reaction can be used as a test for detecting traces of triethylphosphine. The new
  compound is insoluble in water and ether but soluble in alcohol. Its constitution
  is similar to the mineral compound, sulphocarbamate of ammonium.
