tldr: The authors study a product-feedback autocatalator model and explore the initiation
  and propagation of traveling waves in reaction-diffusion systems. They find that
  the concentrations of reactants and autocatalysts can grow in time, and the system
  can develop propagating reaction-diffusion waves under specific conditions. The
  study provides insights into the behavior of complex chemical systems and their
  potential applications.
