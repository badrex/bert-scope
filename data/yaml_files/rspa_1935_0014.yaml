tldr: The authors conducted a study on the interaction of light nuclei, focusing on
  elastic collisions and binding energies. They used the known values of binding energies
  to deduce various results and calculated the cross-section for elastic collisions
  for different interaction ranges. The study also discussed the angular distribution
  of scattered particles and the variation of cross-sections for collisions with heavy
  nuclei. The authors concluded that an attractive potential is necessary for neutron-nuclei
  interactions, and their findings may have implications for understanding the behavior
  of isotopes and the quantum theory of particle interactions.
