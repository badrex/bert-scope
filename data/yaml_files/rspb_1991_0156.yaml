tldr: The study investigates the effects of different calcium buffer concentrations
  on the voltage dependence and timecourse of the calcium-release-dependent inward
  current in rabbit atrial myocytes. The results show that increasing calcium buffer
  concentration reduces the inward current and alters its voltage dependence, suggesting
  that calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum may be triggered by only a
  small fraction of the sarcolemmal calcium current.
