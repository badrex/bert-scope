tldr: The authors study the large elastic deformation of incompressible isotropic
  materials, focusing on the inflation of a circular diaphragm. They apply the theory
  to a problem involving thin shells and use numerical integration to calculate the
  state of deformation throughout the inflated diaphragm. The Mooney form is employed
  for the stored-energy function, simplifying the calculations.
