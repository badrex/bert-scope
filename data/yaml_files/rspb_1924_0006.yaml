tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between phosphate levels in blood
  and urine. They found that after ingesting phosphate, the inorganic phosphate in
  the blood increases by 50-60%, while the urinary output rises five times its normal
  value. The study also showed that the concentration of phosphorus in the urine is
  much higher than in the blood, and that the distribution of inorganic phosphate
  between plasma and corpuscles remains the same under normal conditions and after
  phosphate ingestion.
