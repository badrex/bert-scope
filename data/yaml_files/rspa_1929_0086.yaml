tldr: The authors studied the adsorption of hydrogen on the surface of an electrodeless
  discharge tube. They discovered that the glass surface becomes saturated with a
  monomolecular layer of hydrogen atoms, which is not closely packed. The saturation
  and fatigue of the adsorbing surface were investigated, providing insights into
  the behavior of gases on glass surfaces.
