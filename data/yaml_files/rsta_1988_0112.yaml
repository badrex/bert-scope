tldr: The article discusses the reactivity of heterodiene metal carbonyl complexes
  with nucleophiles in organic synthesis. The authors demonstrate that these complexes
  can produce various products, such as 1,4-diketones, -ketoesters, and pyrroles,
  by reacting with different nucleophiles. This study highlights the potential of
  these transition metal complexes in organic synthesis.
