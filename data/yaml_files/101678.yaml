tldr: The author, Mr. Jessop, investigates a series of accidents in coal mines involving
  a dangerous, fiery gas known as "fulminating damp." He describes the conditions
  and events leading to these accidents, including the symptoms and effects on the
  miners. Mr. Jessop also discusses the properties of the gas, its potential causes,
  and possible ways to prevent future incidents. His findings contribute to a better
  understanding of the hazards faced by miners and the importance of mine safety.
