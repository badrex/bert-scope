tldr: A 13-year-old girl, Elizabeth Dooly, developed a physical anomaly resembling
  a cow's teat on her body after her mother was frightened by a cow. The girl's imagination
  is believed to have played a significant role in this unusual occurrence, which
  is considered a rare example of the power of imagination.
