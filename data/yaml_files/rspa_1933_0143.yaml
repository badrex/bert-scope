tldr: The authors developed a method called the "crossed molecular beams" technique
  to study molecular collisions in gases. They used a beam of alkali metal atoms and
  a heavy, slow-moving molecule as a scatterer. The scattered atoms were collected
  using a surface ionization gauge, allowing them to measure the angular distribution
  of the scattered atoms. This method provided a direct experimental study of collision
  phenomena in gases, offering a new way to investigate intermolecular interactions.
