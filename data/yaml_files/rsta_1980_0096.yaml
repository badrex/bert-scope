tldr: This article presents a model for interfacial cohesion that describes the loss
  in strength of an interface due to the adsorption and adsorption-induced losses
  in interfacial cohesion. The author analyzes the thermodynamics of a separating
  interface, including the effects of multicomponent adsorption, and provides experimental
  data for polycrystalline iron with dilute concentrations of phosphorus. The results
  show that the work for slow separation is naturally less than that for fast separation,
  and the model accounts for diverse possibilities in the process of separation.
