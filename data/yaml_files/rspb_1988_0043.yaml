tldr: The article investigates the impact of photoreceptor coupling and synapse nonlinearity
  on the signal-to-noise ratio in early visual processing. The authors demonstrate
  that receptor coupling can improve the signal-to-noise ratio in bipolar cells, even
  for localized stimuli, when synapse nonlinearity is considered. This finding suggests
  a principle of retinal design that may compete with the requirements of high spatial
  resolution.
