tldr: This study investigates the impact of daily weather conditions on the supply
  of ions, such as chloride, sulfate, and other ions, to fresh waters from atmospheric
  precipitation. The research focuses on the English Lake District and examines the
  correlations between ion supply and various weather factors, including precipitation,
  wind direction, wind velocity, and temperature. The findings show that daily weather
  conditions play a significant role in the supply of ions to fresh waters, with important
  implications for the environment and ecology.
