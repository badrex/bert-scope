tldr: The author, John Simon, examines the thyroid gland's comparative anatomy in
  various vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. He finds that
  the gland is universally present in mammals and birds but varies in presence and
  structure among reptiles and fish. The thyroid gland maintains a relationship with
  the vascular supply of the brain and is dependent on the existence of another organ,
  which may be a supplementary gill in some fish.
