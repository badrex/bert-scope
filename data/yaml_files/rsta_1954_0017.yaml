tldr: This study calculates the distribution of semi-diurnal tides along the equator
  in the Indian Ocean using a theorem in tidal dynamics. The authors apply this theorem
  to the northern part of the Indian Ocean, excluding shallow coastal areas, to determine
  the tidal elevations and currents along the equator. The results provide a Fourier
  cosine series representation of the tidal distribution and offer a direct arithmetical
  calculation of oceanic tidal distribution.
