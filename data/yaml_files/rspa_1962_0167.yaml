tldr: The authors studied the damage caused by fission fragments to crystal lattices
  using high-resolution electron microscopy. They observed disturbances in platinum
  phthalocyanine and found evidence of complex dislocation arrays and dislocation
  dipoles remaining in the crystal after fission fragment bombardment. The research
  also extended to other materials like molybdenum trioxide and molybdenum disulphide,
  revealing dislocations resulting from irradiation.
