tldr: This article investigates the wave drag of a membrane in a fluid dynamics context.
  The authors develop an analytical expression for the average drag of a thin flexible
  membrane submerged below the free surface of a stream. They identify the contributions
  from the wake and each surface wave, showing that one wave's contribution is negative.
  The study has implications for understanding the efficiency of swimming styles in
  submarine animal locomotion and the interaction of deformable submarine bodies with
  surface gravity waves.
