tldr: The authors conducted experiments using the Langmuir probe technique to study
  electron energy distributions in various gases. They found that the energy distribution
  is influenced by factors such as energy gained from the electric field and lost
  to the gas. The results showed that the rate of energy exchange between electrons
  is very low, and the distribution is mainly affected by the loss of high-energy
  electrons to the walls and exciting/ionizing collisions. The study provides valuable
  insights into the discharge mechanisms in plasmas.
