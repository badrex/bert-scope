tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the variation in the length of
  a pendulum vibrating seconds at various stations of the Trigonometrical Survey of
  Great Britain. The study aimed to compare the length of the pendulum in London with
  the standard measure and to determine the variations at different locations. The
  author used a variety of instruments, including a transit, a repeating circle, a
  clock, a chronometer, and an invariable pendulum, to conduct the experiments.
