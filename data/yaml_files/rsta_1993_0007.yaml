tldr: The article discusses the melting and movement of the Earth's mantle beneath
  oceanic islands, using isotopic data to infer the nature of mantle heterogeneity.
  The authors argue that the mantle sources have changed on short timescales, suggesting
  that the heterogeneities are within the Hawaiian mantle plume and that the melting
  zone of the plume is less than 40 km in radius.
