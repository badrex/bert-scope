tldr: This article discusses Newton's experiments on the composition of white light,
  focusing on his famous prism experiment. Newton discovered that white light is made
  up of different colors that can be separated by a prism. He also found that each
  color has a different refractive index, which led to the development of the field
  of spectroscopy. This discovery challenged the prevailing view of light as a single,
  indivisible entity and laid the foundation for modern optics and color theory.
