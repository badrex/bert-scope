tldr: The authors investigate the polarization of zinc electrodes in neutral and acid
  solutions of zinc salts using direct and alternating currents. They find that an
  increase in current density causes a slight increase in the effect, and the influence
  of frequency within the limits of 50-2,000 is negligible. The results show that
  an alternating current superimposed on a direct current can depolarize the electrode.
