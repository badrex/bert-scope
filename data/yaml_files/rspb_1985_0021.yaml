tldr: The study investigates the birth dates of retinal ganglion cells that give rise
  to the crossed and uncrossed optic projections in mice. Contralaterally projecting
  ganglion cells are generated from embryonic day E11 to about E19, while ipsilaterally
  projecting cells are born from E11 to E16. The findings suggest that the bilateral
  projection system in the retina reflects an early developmental program rather than
  the result of competition between the two eyes at later stages.
