tldr: In this article, Isaac Newton provides detailed instructions for conducting
  experiments on the behavior of colors using prisms. He explains the correct positioning
  of the prism and the importance of using a clear day and a small hole to achieve
  the desired results. Newton also addresses criticisms from his contemporaries and
  invites them to try the experiments themselves to verify the findings.
