tldr: The authors developed a dynamic land capability model to quantify the effects
  of land drainage on crop productivity and environmental pollution. The model simulates
  soil moisture conditions, crop growth, and production, considering factors such
  as climate, soil type, and farm management. The study focused on potatoes and spring
  cereals grown on different soil types in the Netherlands over a 30-year period,
  providing a basis for evaluating the effects of soil and drainage on crop yields
  and informing land evaluation studies.
