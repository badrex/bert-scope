tldr: The authors investigated the pressure-concentration equilibria between ferric
  oxide and silica gels and benzene under isothermal conditions. They confirmed the
  difference in adsorptive processes of these two analogous gels and used a unique
  experimental setup to determine equilibrium pressures between benzene vapor and
  solid adsorbents. This study contributes to understanding adsorption and catalytic
  action in gas-solid systems.
