tldr: The authors describe a method for accurately measuring the positions of X-ray
  sources using the Copernicus satellite. They discuss the limitations of the accuracy,
  which is mainly affected by the uncertainty in the experiment pointing direction
  and statistical fluctuations in counting rates. The authors successfully measured
  the positions of several sources and examined the proposed associations between
  sources and bright stars, finding them unlikely.
