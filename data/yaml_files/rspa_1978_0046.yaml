tldr: The authors present a new approach to study proton-hydrogen close-capture collision
  spectroscopy using an impact parameter perturbed-stationary-states treatment. They
  avoid spurious long-range couplings and enforce Galilean invariance by including
  momentum translation factors. The results show excellent agreement with experimental
  data and previous calculations, demonstrating the adaptability of the adiabatic
  representation even at high energies.
