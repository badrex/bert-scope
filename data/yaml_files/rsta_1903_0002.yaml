tldr: The authors explore the equilibrium of rotating liquid cylinders using mathematical
  methods, focusing on potential theory and the properties of homogeneous matter.
  They develop equations to calculate the potential and determine the shape and center
  of gravity of the cylinder, providing insights into fluid dynamics and the behavior
  of rotating liquids.
