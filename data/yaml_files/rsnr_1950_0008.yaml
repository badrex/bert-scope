tldr: The article discusses the efforts of the British Museum Trustees to acquire
  Darwin's letters to Lyell, which were auctioned off in 1950. The letters were eventually
  purchased by the American Philosophical Society, and the correspondence between
  the two institutions details the agreement to preserve and maintain the letters
  for future generations of scholars.
