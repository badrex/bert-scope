tldr: The author describes three different heliotrope designs for use in surveying,
  focusing on their construction and functionality. One design consists of a plane
  mirror with two small reflectors, while the other features a glass plate with silvered
  edges. These heliotropes produce cones of sunlight without requiring any movable
  parts, making them easier to use and more efficient for surveying purposes.
