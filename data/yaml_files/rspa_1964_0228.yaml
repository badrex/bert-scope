tldr: The author presents a new method for solving torsion problems in irregular polygons.
  The method is based on representing the boundary effects by a series of exponentially
  decaying harmonics associated with each edge of the polygon. The resulting simultaneous
  equations are suitable for electronic computer generation and solution. The author
  demonstrates the power and simplicity of the method by solving the torsion problem
  for a hollow square.
