tldr: This article examines the effect of temperature on air viscosity and compares
  the results of previous experiments. The author raises concerns about the accuracy
  of recent measurements by F. A. Williams and suggests that his findings may be less
  reliable than previous studies. The author also proposes improvements to experimental
  methods to increase accuracy and reliability of future measurements.
