tldr: The authors studied the vertebrate fauna and environmental history of Bramerton,
  a type locality for the Norwich Crag in Norfolk, England. They analyzed foraminifer,
  mollusc, and pollen samples from the area and found that the marine sediments were
  deposited under both temperate and colder conditions. The findings suggest that
  the temperate stage at Bramerton represents a new stage in the East Anglian Pleistocene
  succession, called the Bramertonian, while the subsequent cold stage is equivalent
  to the Pre-Pastonian substage of the Norfolk coast.
