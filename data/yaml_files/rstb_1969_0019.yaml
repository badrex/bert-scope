tldr: The authors studied the marine algae of the Solomon Islands and their role in
  biotic reefs during the Royal Society expedition in 1965. They found that around
  220 species of Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta can be credited to the Solomon Islands.
  The authors also discussed the biogeographical aspects, ecological observations,
  and the distribution of Sargassum and encrusting coralline algae in the region.
  The study highlights the importance of encrusting coralline algae in reef development
  and the influence of wave action on reef ecology.
