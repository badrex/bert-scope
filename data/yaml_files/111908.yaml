tldr: The author, A.W. Hofmann, investigates the properties of poly-ammonias, specifically
  focusing on diamines. By examining the formation of salts and the reactions of ammonia
  compounds, Hofmann determines the atomicity of diamines and provides a method for
  diagnosing them. This research contributes to the understanding of ammonia derivatives
  and their chemical properties.
