tldr: The authors studied the histological features, development, and pathogenesis
  of inner ear degeneration in deaf white cats. They found that the degeneration occurs
  between the 4th and 6th day of natal life and is confined to the cochlea and saccule.
  The study suggests that the inner ear degeneration is a derangement of the water
  electrolyte regulating mechanism, and the gene may play a role by reducing enzyme
  content during critical maturation. Similar mechanisms may be involved in human
  congenital deafness, both genetically determined and in cases with no apparent genetic
  factors.
