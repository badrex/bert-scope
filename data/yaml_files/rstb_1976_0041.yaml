tldr: The author examines the suboesophageal lobes and ganglia of the arms in the
  Loligo nervous system, identifying a hierarchy of centres and their functions. The
  study provides detailed knowledge of the anatomy and connections of these centres,
  which can be compared with Octopus and other cephalopods for a better understanding
  of their organization and behavior.
