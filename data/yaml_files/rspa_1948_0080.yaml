tldr: The authors conducted experiments to demonstrate the electroviscous effect in
  ionic liquids, confirming the theoretical predictions made in a preceding paper.
  They observed the approach of a quartz lens to a quartz plate in various liquids,
  including water, methyl alcohol, toluene, and ether, and found no significant difference
  in the distance of separation between the surfaces when the liquids were present.
  This study provides evidence against the existence of high equilibrium distances
  of separation and thick compressible solvate layers at liquid interfaces.
