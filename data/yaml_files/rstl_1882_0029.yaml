tldr: This article presents the botanical and chemical results of experiments conducted
  on the mixed herbage of permanent meadows over a period of more than 20 years. The
  authors describe the different manuring agents used and their effects on the growth
  and composition of the herbage. They also discuss the challenges and methods involved
  in separating and analyzing the various plant species in the samples. The study
  provides insights into the relationship between plant growth, soil fertility, and
  manure application in meadow ecosystems.
