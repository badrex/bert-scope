tldr: The study examines the accommodatory system in two teleost fish species, mackerel
  and bass. The lens muscle's structure and innervation are characterized, and the
  neural pathway controlling the lens muscle is analyzed. The lens muscle contains
  smooth muscle cells with numerous mitochondria and synaptic endings. The nerve controlling
  the lens muscle has less than 100 myelinated nerve fibers, and electrical stimulation
  demonstrates that it is controlled by postganglionic fibers of the oculomotor (parasympathetic)
  nerve. The ultrastructural features of the lens muscle and its nerve control resemble
  those of the mammalian ciliary muscle.
