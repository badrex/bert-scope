tldr: The authors developed a new experimental method using a microbalance and multiple-point
  manometer to accurately measure the densities and limiting densities of vapours
  at low pressures. They tested the method with benzene vapour and found it to be
  reliable and applicable to other vapours. This method provides a more precise way
  to study vapour properties and offers insights into the behaviour of vapours at
  low pressures.
