revised_title: 'Vibration-Rotation Interaction and Intensities in the Electronic Spectra
  of Diatomic Molecules: The Hydroxyl Radical'

tldr: This article examines the effect of vibration-rotation interaction on the intensities
  in the electronic spectra of diatomic molecules, specifically the hydroxyl radical.
  The author investigates the transition probability and its dependency on rotational
  quantum numbers, finding that vibration-rotation interaction has a significant effect
  on rotational temperature and is especially important for certain bands. The study
  provides insights into the variation of transition moments with internuclear distance
  and offers corrections to rotational temperatures.
