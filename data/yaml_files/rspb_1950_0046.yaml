tldr: Researchers at the National Institute for Medical Research synthesized 87 compounds
  from two 4-chloroquinolines to find an amoebicidal agent that could replace emetine.
  They discovered several compounds with in vitro activity on Entamoeba histolytica,
  a parasite responsible for amoebic infections. The study aimed to establish a reliable
  biological test for amoebicidal activity and explore potential alternatives to emetine
  for treating amoebiasis.
