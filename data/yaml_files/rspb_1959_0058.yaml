tldr: The authors conducted experiments on toad muscles to study the reversal of chemical
  reactions during muscle contraction and stretching. They discovered that when a
  muscle is stretched during contraction, the chemical products of the reaction can
  be wholly returned to their initial state. This result depends on the amplitude
  and timing of the stretch, and the authors propose a thermoelastic heat absorption
  theory to explain the observed phenomena.
