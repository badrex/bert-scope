tldr: This study investigates the time variations of directional cosmic ray intensity
  at low latitudes, focusing on the solar daily variation and changes in east-west
  asymmetry. The authors interpret these variations in terms of geomagnetic and solar
  factors, providing insights into the behavior of cosmic rays and their relationship
  with solar activity.
