revised_title: Relativity Theory of Light and Plane Waves

tldr: The authors explore the relativity theory of plane waves, specifically focusing
  on the propagation of electromagnetic and gravitational waves. They discover that
  infinite plane waves cannot be propagated without change of the wave-form, and that
  the relativity theory of light must be approached through the study of divergent
  waves.
