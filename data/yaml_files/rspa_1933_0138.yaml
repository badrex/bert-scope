tldr: The authors analyze Schott's method for calculating the intensities of spectrum
  lines and find that it leads to the generally accepted classical result. They also
  show that Schott's criticism of the usual procedure is based on a misunderstanding
  and that his method is not new, as it was used by Klein in 1927.
