tldr: This article introduces complex stochastic systems and their applications, discussing
  the importance of modern computer technology in analyzing large amounts of data.
  It highlights various applications, such as telecommunication systems, image analysis,
  and expert systems, and emphasizes the need to reflect lack of independence in these
  systems. The article also mentions other complex stochastic systems, like neural
  nets, chaotic nonlinear time series, and signal processing.
