tldr: The authors investigate the nuclear magnetic relaxation and electron-nucleus
  Overhauser effect in liquid solutions containing free radicals. They calculate the
  effects of magnetic dipole-dipole interactions and scalar spin-spin interactions,
  considering two models for the time dependence of these interactions. The study
  aims to analyze the information that can be obtained from experiments involving
  the nuclear Overhauser effect, which has been found to change at different fields
  and temperatures.
