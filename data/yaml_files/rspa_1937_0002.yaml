tldr: This article investigates the effect of space-charge on the secondary current
  in a triode. The authors develop a theoretical model to determine the relationship
  between the anode and grid potentials and the primary and secondary anode currents
  in the condition of space-charge limitation. The study provides insights into the
  behavior of secondary electrons and helps improve the understanding of vacuum electronics.
