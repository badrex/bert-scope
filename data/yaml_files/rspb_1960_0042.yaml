tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of reactions between sheep haemoglobin
  and isocyanides. They found that the initial rate of combination decreases with
  increasing chain length. The rate of dissociation of the first isocyanide molecule
  from saturated haemoglobin is the same for all members of the series. The study
  provides insights into the 'crevice' hypothesis of haemoglobin structure and contributes
  to understanding the differences in affinity between isocyanides.
