tldr: The article investigates the interactions between different neurotransmitter
  receptors in Xenopus oocytes. It demonstrates that serotonin, acetylcholine, and
  other neurotransmitters can activate a common effector system, suggesting that they
  may all link into a common receptor-channel coupling system. This system involves
  phosphoinositide metabolism and calcium liberation, leading to the opening of chloride
  channels in the oocyte membrane.
