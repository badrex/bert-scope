tldr: The authors investigate the extraction and properties of yeast cell plasma,
  also known as "Zymase," which is a soluble enzyme responsible for alcoholic fermentation.
  They describe their method of preparing the cell plasma and discuss its physical
  properties, as well as the auto-fermentation that occurs in the juice. Their findings
  contribute to the understanding of yeast cell biology and fermentation processes.
