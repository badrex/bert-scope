tldr: This article describes the application of micro-manipulative techniques to study
  cells in tissue cultures. The authors discuss their methods, including the use of
  dark-ground illumination and a special condenser, and present observations on various
  types of cells, such as fibroblasts, macrophages, and pigmented epithelial cells.
  They also describe the reactions of cells to mechanical irritation and the role
  of the centrosphere in cellular stiffness.
