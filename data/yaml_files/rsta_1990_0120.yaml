tldr: The article discusses the study of photoinitiated H-atom reactions in weakly
  bonded complexes, focusing on the entrance channel stereospecificity. The authors
  found that broadside H-atom approaches in HBr complexes are favored over end-on
  approaches, leading to different reaction probabilities. This striking steric effect
  is explained by the anisotropic intermolecular force field binding the complex,
  resulting in a specifically aligned precursor geometry. The results are interpreted
  in terms of entrance channel stereospecificity influencing chemically distinct product
  channels.
