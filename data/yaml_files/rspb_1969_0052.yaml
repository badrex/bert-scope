tldr: This article discusses the biochemical aspects of blood coagulation, focusing
  on the cascade hypothesis and the roles of various enzymes and factors in the coagulation
  process. It reviews the conversion of fibrinogen to fibrin, the process of prothrombin
  to thrombin, and the involvement of phospholipids in the coagulation mechanism.
  The article also explores the different factors involved in the conversion of factor
  II and the two possible reaction schemes for this process.
