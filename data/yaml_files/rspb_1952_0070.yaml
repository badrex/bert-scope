tldr: The authors developed an X-ray shadow microscope using electron lenses to produce
  a small X-ray source, allowing high-resolution imaging of biological specimens.
  The microscope achieved a resolution of 0.5 micron, which was twice that of the
  best optical microscopes at the time. The technique was useful for observing living
  organisms, as well as dried specimens, and had potential applications in metallurgy
  and crystallography.
