tldr: The authors studied the infra-red spectrum of dimethylacetylene and found that
  the doubling of main peaks in the spectrum is likely due to vibrational coupling
  between the two methyl groups. They also estimated the torsional barrier to be not
  greater than about 10 and explained how it could be accurately evaluated from a
  better-resolved infra-red spectrum.
