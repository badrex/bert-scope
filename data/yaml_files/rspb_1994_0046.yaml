tldr: The authors developed a model and computation scheme to predict forced ventilation
  in animal fur, using a fur-covered cylinder as a geometric model. They used an anisotropic
  model for intra-fur flow and pressure distribution data from a solid cylinder to
  obtain more realistic velocity profiles within the fur. The results can be used
  to develop a comprehensive model of transport processes in animal or artificial
  fur and other porous media under various environmental conditions.
