tldr: The author, Henry Bence Jones, conducted experiments to study the rapidity of
  crystalloid substances, specifically lithium and rubidium, entering the vascular
  and non-vascular textures of the body. Using spectrum-analysis, he observed the
  penetration of these substances in various tissues, including the lens, cartilage,
  and aqueous humor of guinea pigs. The findings suggest that lithium can penetrate
  deeper into the tissues than rubidium.
