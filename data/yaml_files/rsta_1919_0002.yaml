tldr: This study investigates the specific heat of aqueous solutions, focusing on
  sodium and potassium chlorides. The research finds that the specific heat of the
  solute remains constant at all dilutions, and the solution lowers the mean specific
  heat of water by an amount proportional to the mean specific contraction of the
  water. This relationship helps in understanding the changes in the constitution
  of free water in solutions and provides a method to calculate the specific heat
  of solutions using densities and the known specific heat of water.
