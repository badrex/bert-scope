tldr: The author presents a simplified and rigorous theory for the perturbations of
  close earth satellite orbits, valid for all orbital eccentricities less than unity.
  The method uses a vector treatment and describes the orbital geometry in terms of
  angular momentum, the direction of perigee, and eccentricity. The author applies
  the method to the effects of the earth's oblateness and atmospheric resistance,
  evaluating integrals as asymptotic series for determining the perturbations with
  high accuracy.
