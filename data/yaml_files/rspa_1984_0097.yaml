tldr: This article examines the Moine-Dalradian boundary in the Scottish Highlands,
  which marks a significant change in lithological character. The authors review regional
  geochemical data and recent geophysical compilations to investigate the role of
  the pre-Caledonian 'Old Moine' complex in the evolution of the Highland region.
  The study suggests that the Moine-Dalradian boundary played a crucial role in the
  sedimentary, metamorphic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Caledonian
  orogen from late Precambrian to early Devonian times.
