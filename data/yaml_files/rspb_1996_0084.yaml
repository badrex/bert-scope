tldr: The author's model explains interspecific life-history patterns in animals with
  indeterminate growth, such as fish and reptiles, by considering optimal allocation
  of resources. The study shows that in a seasonal environment, animals should grow
  after maturation and allocate more resources to reproduction as they age. This leads
  to growth curves similar to Bertalanffy's, with growth constants and asymptotic
  lengths. The model generates patterns consistent with empirical findings, including
  positive correlations between mortality rate, growth constant, and size at maturity,
  and between size at maturity and asymptotic length.
