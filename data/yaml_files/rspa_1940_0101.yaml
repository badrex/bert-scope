tldr: The authors investigate the effect of carbon monoxide on the hydrogen-oxygen
  reaction at a palladium surface. They find that small amounts of carbon monoxide
  can inhibit the reaction, but the effect is temporary. The length of the inert periods
  increases with the amount of carbon monoxide introduced, and the rate of removal
  of carbon monoxide becomes very high when the amount is small. The results support
  the hypothesis of De la Rive that the catalysis of the reaction involves the alternate
  oxidation of the metal and the reduction of the surface oxide by hydrogen or carbon
  monoxide.
