tldr: A letter from Reverend Mr. Holdsworth describes a sudden and unusual agitation
  of waters in Dartmouth on November 1, 1755. Despite little wind, boats near the
  harbor tumbled and tossed, and the waters rose to a higher level than usual. This
  event lasted about three-quarters of an hour before returning to normal. The author
  notes that this phenomenon was not observed on the southern coast of Devonshire.
