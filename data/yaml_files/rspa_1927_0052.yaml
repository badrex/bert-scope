tldr: The authors investigate the structure of silicates and the role of oxygen in
  their crystalline arrangement. They propose that silicates can be seen as "coordinated
  structures of ions packed together" and describe the different types of ions and
  their positions within the crystal lattice. The study provides insights into the
  properties and behavior of silicate minerals.
