tldr: The authors observed infrared chemiluminescence from carbon monoxide in reactions
  of atomic oxygen with acetylene and carbon suboxide. They found that the emission
  spectra depended on the flow rates of the reactants and provided insights into the
  mechanisms of the elementary reactions involved. The results can be used to compare
  and analyze different reactions and their chemiluminescent processes.
