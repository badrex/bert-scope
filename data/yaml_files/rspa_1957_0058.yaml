tldr: The authors conducted experiments on zinc crystals to study the mechanics of
  twinning and the interrelation between slip and twinning. They found that twinning
  occurs after plastic deformation by slip on the (1122) plane, and the twinning stress
  depends on the work hardening accompanying the slip. The study suggests that slip
  is a necessary prelude to twin nucleation, and the observations provide insights
  into the mechanical resistance of metals to twinning.
