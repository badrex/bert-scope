tldr: The article discusses the challenges in measuring and standardizing radioactivity,
  particularly in the context of artificial radioelements. It also explores the presence
  of penetrating particles (mesons) in atmospheric showers and their variation with
  altitude, as well as the structure of local showers connected to high-energy cosmic-ray
  phenomena.
