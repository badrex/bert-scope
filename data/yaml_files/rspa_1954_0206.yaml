tldr: The authors developed a thermocouple method to track the non-stationary state
  of chemical reactions, specifically polymerization reactions. They measured the
  temperature rise during the reaction and used it to calculate the rate constants
  for the propagation and termination reactions. This method allowed them to study
  reactions with longer lifetimes and provided a more accurate measure of the reaction's
  parameters.
