tldr: This article discusses the Moon's physical evolution and the marked departure
  from hydrostatic equilibrium. The author explores the existence of a lunar core
  and the role of convection in the Moon's interior. The study also examines the differences
  in the moments of inertia and the implications for the Moon's shape and structure.
