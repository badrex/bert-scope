tldr: The author analyzes the crystal structure of aragonite, a mineral with the same
  composition as calcite, and finds that it has a simple orthorhombic lattice. The
  study uses X-ray diffraction to determine the positions of calcium atoms and CO3
  groups within the crystal structure, revealing similarities and differences between
  aragonite and calcite. This research contributes to the understanding of the structures
  of minerals and their properties.
