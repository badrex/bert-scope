tldr: This article discusses the expectations and challenges of atmospheric neutrino
  event rates. It explores the anomalous flavor ratio observed for atmospheric neutrinos
  and investigates the potential role of neutrino oscillations in explaining this
  anomaly. The article also examines the impact of nuclear effects on the predicted
  ratio of interactions and the importance of precise measurements and calibration
  of detectors to clarify the situation.
