tldr: The article investigates boundary layer interactions and upstream influence
  in supersonic flows without separation. It extends the author's method of perturbing
  a parallel flow and introduces a new boundary condition to analyze the behavior
  of each harmonic component outside the inner viscous sublayer. The study provides
  solutions for large and small disturbances, deducing the principal local features
  of wall-pressure distribution and flow outside the boundary layer, as well as the
  extent of upstream influence. The findings have implications for understanding the
  flow upstream of separation in interactions with laminar separation.
