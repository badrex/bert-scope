tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effect of a magnetic field on the rate
  of subsidence of torsional oscillations in nickel and iron wires. They found that
  the magnetic field increased the rate of subsidence in nickel and decreased it in
  iron. The hardness of the metal and the effect of drawing and annealing on the wires
  were also studied, showing that the magnetic field's impact on internal viscosity
  depends on the metal's hardness.
