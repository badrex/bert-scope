tldr: The article presents an experimental study of the mechanical properties of copper,
  zinc, and aluminum under compression using the split Hopkinson pressure bar technique.
  The results show that the strain rate has a significant effect on the stress-strain
  behavior of these materials. The study also proposes a nonlinear constitutive equation
  to describe the dynamic mechanical behavior of these metals, which can be used for
  further research and applications.
