tldr: This study investigates the effect of light on blood circulation and blood pressure.
  The researchers found that exposure to light caused a temporary dilation of blood
  vessels, leading to a drop in blood pressure. They also discovered that the response
  to light varied among individuals, with some showing an initial vasoconstriction
  before the dilation. The study suggests that the mechanism behind this response
  is likely nervous in nature.
