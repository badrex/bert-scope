tldr: This article investigates the motion of a perfectly conducting fluid past a
  fixed body in the presence of an aligned magnetic field. The author examines various
  limiting cases and their effects on the fluid dynamics, including the drag on the
  body and the existence of upstream and downstream wakes. The study aims to reconcile
  different approaches and provide a better understanding of the complex interactions
  between the fluid, magnetic field, and body.
