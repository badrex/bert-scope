tldr: The authors studied the effects of tightly-timed mossy-fibre arrival volleys
  in the cerebellar cortex. They identified presynaptic spike potentials, synaptic
  potentials, and granule-cell firing patterns. The research also revealed single
  glomerular potentials, which can sometimes be confused with cellular spike potentials.
  This work provides insights into the electrophysiology of the mossy-fibre pathway
  in the cerebellum.
