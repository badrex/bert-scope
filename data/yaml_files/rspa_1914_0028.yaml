tldr: The author investigates the transparency and translucence of surface films formed
  on metal surfaces during polishing. They observe that these films cover pits on
  the metal surface and are highly translucent. Using microscopy and autochrome plates,
  they demonstrate that the films are thin and that the pits underneath are empty
  when the films form, suggesting that the films flow unsupported. This research provides
  insight into the process of metal polishing and the properties of surface films.
