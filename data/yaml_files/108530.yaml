tldr: This article by Charles Wheatstone explores the effects of binocular vision
  and how our perception of magnitude and distance is influenced by the convergence
  of the optic axes and the size of the images on the retina. Wheatstone describes
  an instrument that allows for the manipulation of these factors, demonstrating how
  our perception of an object's size can vary while its retinal image remains constant,
  and how our perception of distance is affected by the convergence of the optic axes.
  The findings challenge the notion that the sensation of convergence immediately
  suggests distance and suggest that our perception of distance is a judgment based
  on a comparison of retinal and perceived magnitudes.
