tldr: This study investigates the ability of Leishmania, a parasite responsible for
  Kala Azar disease, to survive in cold temperatures. The researchers found that the
  flagellate stage of the parasite can withstand exposure to temperatures as low as
  -12°C for at least 10 days. This discovery suggests that Leishmania may be able
  to persist in the environment during winter, possibly within the alimentary tract
  of hibernating insects.
