tldr: The authors analyzed the spectrum of e Orionis, a type-star of the Alnitamian
  Group, and discovered the origin of certain lines in the spectrum. They found that
  the lines were due to nitrogen and silicon occurring as impurities in the chromium
  used in their experiments. The study helped in understanding the composition of
  stars and the behavior of elements in different conditions.
