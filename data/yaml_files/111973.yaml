tldr: This article explores the absorption and radiation of heat by various gases
  and vapors. The author, John Tyndall, examines the effects of chemical combination
  on the absorption and radiation of heat, finding that compound gases have a higher
  absorptive power than elementary gases. The author also investigates dynamic heating
  and chilling, as well as the potential for determining the temperature of space
  through direct experimentation.
