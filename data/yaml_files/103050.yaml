tldr: This article provides a historical account of the dispute between Mr. Leibniz
  and Dr. Keill regarding the right of invention of the method of fluxions, also known
  as the differential method. It discusses the Commercium Epistolicum Collinii & aliorum,
  a collection of letters and papers that reveal the development of a general method
  of resolving finite equations into infinite ones and applying these equations to
  solve problems using the method of fluxions and moments. The article highlights
  the contributions of key mathematicians, including Isaac Newton, John Collins, and
  James Gregory, and sheds light on the controversy surrounding the invention of this
  crucial mathematical concept.
