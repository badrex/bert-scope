tldr: The authors propose a covariant theory of strong interaction symmetries, focusing
  on the relativistic form factors in baryon-meson and meson-meson cases. They classify
  particles based on a symmetry scheme and provide a detailed formalism for writing
  fully relativistic form factors. The new results include the relativistic form factor
  in strong interaction physics of the octet baryons and the and mesons, and the magnetic
  moments of the proton and neutron.
