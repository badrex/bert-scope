tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the distribution of positive and negative
  radicals of electrolytes on insulated metallic conductors. They used silver strips
  and copper cylinders in a solution of copper sulfate to observe the accumulation
  of radicals near the electrodes. The results showed that the positive radical accumulates
  more near the positive electrode, while the negative radical spreads over a greater
  surface area.
