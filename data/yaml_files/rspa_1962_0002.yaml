tldr: Researchers have determined the three-dimensional structure of hemoglobin at
  5.5 Ã… resolution, revealing that it consists of four subunits in a tetrahedral arrangement.
  The positions of the iron atoms in the hem groups are confirmed, and the structure
  is compared to myoglobin. The detailed structure provides insights into the assembly
  of the molecule and its relationship to the amino acid sequences of human and horse
  hemoglobin and sperm-whale myoglobin.
