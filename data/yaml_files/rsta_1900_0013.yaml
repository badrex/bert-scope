tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the thermodynamical properties of superheated
  steam, focusing on the cooling effects of free expansion. They investigated the
  flow of steam through an orifice and the impact of pressure and temperature on the
  steam's properties. The research aimed to understand the conditions under which
  adiabatic flow occurs and the implications for wiredrawing experiments.
