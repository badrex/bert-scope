tldr: In this article, Patrick Wilson describes an extraordinary degree of cold experienced
  in Glasgow and conducts experiments to study the temperature of hoar-frost and the
  air near it. He observes that the air temperature at a higher elevation is warmer
  than at ground level and that hoar-frost has a significantly lower temperature than
  the surrounding air. This research contributes to the understanding of temperature
  variations and the effects of frost on the environment.
