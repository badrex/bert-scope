tldr: The author discusses the importance of studying microbes in their natural host
  environment to understand their pathogenicity and virulence. They highlight three
  studies that demonstrate the influence of host factors on the production of virulence
  determinants in bacteria, such as iron limitation, erythritol, and CMP-NANA. The
  author emphasizes the need to examine bacteria grown in vivo to better understand
  and combat microbial diseases.
