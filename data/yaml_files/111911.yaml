tldr: The author investigates the reaction of triethylphosphine with various chlorinated
  derivatives of marsh gas. They found that the number of triethylphosphine molecules
  fixed by these derivatives is determined by the number of chlorine equivalents they
  contain. The author also discovered that these compounds can form a variety of chlorinated
  phosphonium bases, and that the final products of the reaction depend on the relative
  proportions of the agents used.
