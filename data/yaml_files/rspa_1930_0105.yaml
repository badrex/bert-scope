tldr: The authors studied the ultra-violet absorption spectrum of phosgene vapour
  and found that the normal molecule has three energy levels separated by intervals
  of 592 cm. They discovered that the activated molecule has two vibration periods
  and that the atomic vibration frequencies are less in the activated molecule, indicating
  that the distance between atoms increases. The phosgene molecule is more deformable
  than formaldehyde but less than chlorine. The study also discusses the mechanism
  of the photochemical reaction and the role of the isotope effect in molecular spectra.
