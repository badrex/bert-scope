tldr: The authors investigated the equilibrium diagram of the silver-zinc system through
  various experimental methods, including thermal, microscopic, and X-ray techniques.
  They established that the depression of the freezing point of silver by zinc is
  slightly greater than that produced by an equal atomic percentage of indium. The
  study also found that the solidus and liquidus curves for the -phase do not coincide
  at 50 atomic% of zinc, and the freezing range of the equiatomic alloy is approximately
  3°C. This research provides a detailed understanding of the silver-zinc system and
  its importance in material science and metallurgy.
