tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of cAMP-dependent protein kinase,
  a critical enzyme in controlling cell growth. The crystal structure of a ternary
  complex containing MgATP and a 20-residue inhibitor peptide reveals the role of
  conserved residues at the active site. The enzyme is regulated through covalent
  modifications and high-affinity binding of protein inhibitors. Understanding the
  structure and function of this enzyme is essential for studying cellular signaling
  and growth control.
