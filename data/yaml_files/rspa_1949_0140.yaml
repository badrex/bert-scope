tldr: 'This study examines the turbulent fluctuations of a tidal current in the Mersey
  estuary using a current meter placed on the riverbed. The researchers found two
  main types of fluctuations: short-period fluctuations with periods of a few seconds
  and long-period fluctuations with periods ranging from 0 to several minutes. The
  short-period fluctuations near the bottom are believed to be evidence of turbulence
  associated with bottom friction, marking the first experimental establishment of
  such turbulent velocity fluctuations in the sea.'
