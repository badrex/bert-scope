tldr: The author investigated the origin and development of the wall and connecting
  threads in plant cells. They discovered that these threads arise from the median
  nodes of the spindle fibers and found them in endosperm cells of certain plants.
  This research contributes to understanding the histology of plant cells and their
  connections.
