revised_title: Determining the Absolute Intensity of the Aurora Line and Number of
  Atomic Transitions

tldr: This article discusses the process of determining the absolute intensity of
  the aurora line in the night sky and the number of atomic transitions required to
  maintain it. The author uses an auroral filter and heterochromatic photometry to
  calibrate the scale of intensities in observations made over seven years. The findings
  provide a better understanding of the aurora and its effects on the Earth's atmosphere.
