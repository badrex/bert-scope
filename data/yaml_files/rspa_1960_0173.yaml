tldr: This article discusses the history and development of the ceramic industry,
  focusing on the materials and techniques used in England. It covers the production
  of traditional ceramic materials such as china clay, ball clay, silica, and Cornish
  stone, as well as the use of animal bone in bone china. The article also explores
  the refractory properties of clays and their applications in furnace construction
  and other industries. Additionally, it highlights the challenges faced by the ceramist
  in developing new materials to meet new demands and the growing field of materials
  research in ceramics.
