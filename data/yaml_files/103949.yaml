tldr: The author presents an improved version of Davis's quadrant, which uses a mercurial
  level to measure the altitude of the sun or stars at sea without relying on the
  visible horizon. This innovation allows for more accurate latitude determination,
  even in challenging conditions such as hazy weather or calm seas. The author shares
  details of the instrument's design and demonstrates its effectiveness through experiments
  at sea.
