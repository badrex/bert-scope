tldr: The author, William Gregor, conducted experiments on a mineral substance previously
  believed to be Zeolite and two species of Uran-glimmer. He found that the mineral
  substance had different properties and composition than Hydrargyllite or Wavellite.
  The study included analyzing the mineral's hardness, specific gravity, and chemical
  composition, as well as the effects of heat on the substance. The author also discovered
  that the yellow and green crystals accompanying the mineral contained different
  elements and properties than those of Uran-glimmer.
