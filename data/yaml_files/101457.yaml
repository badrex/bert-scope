tldr: The article discusses the trials of Campani's new optic glasses in Italy and
  their ability to distinguish people at a distance of 4 leagues. The Great Duke of
  Tuscany and Prince Leopold found these glasses to be superior to others. The author
  also mentions the expected improvements in telescope length and aperture size. In
  the meantime, parabolic glasses being developed in London are nearing completion.
