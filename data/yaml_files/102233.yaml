tldr: The author describes the dissection of a bitch whose uterus had filled with
  bones and flesh from a previous conception, and how the eggs from a second conception
  were attached to various parts of the abdomen. This observation supports the theory
  of animal reproduction through eggs, which was being challenged by other scientists
  at the time. The author also compares the process of animal reproduction to the
  growth of plants from seeds, highlighting the care and complexity involved in creating
  new life.
