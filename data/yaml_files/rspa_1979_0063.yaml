tldr: The authors studied the X-ray spectrum and variability of 13 active galaxies
  using the M.S.S.L. proportional counter system on Ariel 5. They found that the X-ray
  emission from these galaxies is variable, with changes in the line of sight hydrogen
  column density. The study also indicates that some active galaxies may have compact
  sources and not be part of a cluster of galaxies.
