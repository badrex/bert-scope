tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a microbeam of a-particles to irradiate
  single cells in metaphase and studied the effects on chromosomes. They found that
  at low doses, cells showed mainly cytoplasmic effects, while at higher doses, all
  cells exhibited clumping of nuclear material and failure to divide. The study also
  compared the sensitivity of chick fibroblast cells and Chinese hamster cells, and
  the effects of whole cell irradiation versus microbeam irradiation.
