tldr: This article discusses the growth and form of modular organisms, specifically
  focusing on lower plants and the occurrence of meristems. It compares the growth
  of fungal and streptomycete hyphae and their similarities in morphology. The article
  also explores the growth in lower green plants, particularly algae, and the question
  of whether coenocytic algae are modular or not.
