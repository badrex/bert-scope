tldr: This article discusses the origin of cosmic rays observed near Earth, focusing
  on the choice between galactic and metagalactic models. It reviews various models,
  including galactic models with halo and disk structures, and metagalactic models
  with universal and local components. The article emphasizes the importance of answering
  key questions about cosmic-ray trapping regions, sources, propagation, and acceleration
  mechanisms to better understand the origin of these high-energy particles.
