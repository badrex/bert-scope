tldr: The author, A.P.W. Philip, discusses the relationship between the nervous and
  muscular systems in animals. He proposes that the brain and spinal marrow are the
  only active parts of the nervous system, while nerves, plexuses, and ganglions are
  passive and only serve to convey and combine information from the active organs.
  This is contrary to the views of many physiologists who consider ganglions as the
  sources of nervous influence. Philip conducts an experiment on a pithed animal to
  test this theory, applying mechanical irritation and chemical agents to the ganglions
  and plexuses of the ganglionic nerves. He concludes that the brain and spinal marrow
  supply an inanimate agent, similar to galvanic influence, which affects the muscular
  fiber as a stimulant or sedative.
