tldr: The author presents a method to find a near value of a slowly-converging infinite
  series using Sir Isaac Newton's binomial theorem. The method involves using generating
  fractions and adjusting the values of m and n to approach equality with the series'
  coefficients. The author demonstrates this method with an example of the series
  x + xx/2 + x3/3 + x4/4 + x5/5 +... when x is nearly equal to 1.
