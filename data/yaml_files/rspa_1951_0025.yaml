tldr: This article explores the application of non-commutative algebra to the study
  of projective geometry, specifically focusing on the quadrangular figures studied
  by Hessenberg and Vahlen. The author develops a method for assigning numerical marks
  to points on lines and examines the properties of these marks in relation to the
  axioms of projective geometry. The article also discusses the transformation of
  points and lines in projective geometry and its implications for the study of quadrangles.
