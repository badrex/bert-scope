tldr: The study examines the effects of heat exposure on rat testes, focusing on the
  development of germ cells and the function of Sertoli cells. Different exposure
  times to heat were tested, revealing critical periods of damage to germ cells and
  changes in the lipid content of Sertoli cells. The research also investigates the
  role of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in recovery and the functional activity
  of Leydig cells.
