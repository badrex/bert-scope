tldr: The article explores the analysis of occluding contours in three-dimensional
  shapes, focusing on the assumptions made by our perception to infer the shape of
  a surface from its silhouette. The author proves that if the assumptions hold for
  distant vantage points, the viewed surface must be a generalized cone. This result
  helps in developing methods to interpret occluding contours and improve image analysis
  in artificial intelligence.
