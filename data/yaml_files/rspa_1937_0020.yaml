tldr: The author presents a method based on molecular orbitals to study the electronic
  structure of polyenes and aromatic molecules. They explain how the interaction between
  electrons in these molecules causes the lengths of carbon-to-carbon bonds to be
  intermediate between single and double bonds, leading to a concept of fractional
  bond order. This method allows for the calculation of resonance energy and provides
  insights into the nature of chemical bonds in these complex molecules.
