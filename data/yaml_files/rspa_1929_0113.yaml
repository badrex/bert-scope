tldr: The author investigates the effect of oxidation on the soft X-ray emission from
  various elements. They find that oxidation levels the efficiency of elements, suggesting
  that oxygen atoms introduce a common factor into the emitting targets. The study
  provides insights into the relationship between oxidation and X-ray emission, which
  can be useful for understanding the behavior of materials in various applications.
