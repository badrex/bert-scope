tldr: This article discusses the complex interactions between Earth tides, ocean tides,
  and tidal loading. The distortion of the Earth's gravitational potential field by
  the ocean tide has been calculated, accounting for both the elastic deformation
  of the Earth and the self-potential of the water. The potential field generated
  by the ocean tide is significant and may have a considerable influence on the tidal
  motion. The study of Earth tides and ocean tides is crucial for understanding their
  effects on the Earth's geophysics and oceanography.
