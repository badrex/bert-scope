tldr: This article discusses the various aspects of extensional tectonics associated
  with convergent plate boundaries. It reviews observations from different areas that
  illustrate the diverse features of this phenomenon, which is still not fully understood.
  The authors explore the geophysical and geochemical characteristics of crust formed
  by back-arc spreading and the different models proposed to explain the origin of
  extensional features in various regions. They also emphasize the importance of plate
  tectonics in understanding these extensional features.
