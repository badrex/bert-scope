tldr: The author investigates the development and morphology of teeth in Ornithorhynchus,
  a primitive mammal. They examine the early stages of tooth differentiation, the
  later stages of tooth development, and the dentition of monotremes. The study provides
  insights into the evolutionary relationships of mammals and the significance of
  tooth structures in their development.
