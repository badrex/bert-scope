tldr: This article discusses the importance of predictive models in soil productivity
  and environmental pollution. It highlights the need for adjusting agronomic practices
  according to different conditions and the significance of forecasting the consequences
  of changes in practice. The article also emphasizes the role of predictive models
  in law-making, particularly in controlling pollution. It presents various approaches
  to prediction and explores the correlation between average national yields and fertilizer
  application.
