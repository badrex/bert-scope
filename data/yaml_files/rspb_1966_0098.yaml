tldr: The authors investigated the toxic effects of copper on the pigeon brain through
  subarachnoid injections. They found that copper induced convulsions and death in
  pigeons and inhibited pigeon and rat brain mitochondria. The study also showed that
  chelating agents like penicillamine and lipoate could protect against the toxic
  action of copper. The results suggest that copper may directly affect cell surfaces,
  rather than altering the charge on some membrane surface.
