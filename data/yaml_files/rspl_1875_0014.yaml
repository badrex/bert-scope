tldr: The author studied the development of spinal nerves in elasmobranch fishes,
  specifically Scylium, Pristiurus, and Torpedo. They discovered that the posterior
  and anterior roots of the spinal nerves arise as independent outgrowths from the
  neural canal and eventually unite. The author also observed that the development
  of the posterior roots of some cranial nerves is similar to that of the spinal nerves,
  which has implications for their morphological relations.
