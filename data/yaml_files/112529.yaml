tldr: In this article, the author discusses the exploration of Central Australia and
  the various theories surrounding the interior of the continent. They describe the
  discoveries made by various explorers, including Burke and Wills, M'Dougal Stuart,
  M'Kinlay, Walker, and Landsborough, which debunked the desert theory. The author
  also provides an outline of the main characteristics of the ground to the north

  route through the center. They discuss the geological and meteorological aspects
  of the region, including the effects of floods and weather on the landscape, and
  the influence of the monsoon on the climate.
