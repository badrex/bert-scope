tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the ionization of atmospheric
  air and the leakage of electricity through dust-free air. They discovered that there
  is a continual leakage of electricity from a charged conductor suspended in a closed
  vessel containing dust-free air. The leakage rate is independent of the potential
  and is approximately proportional to the pressure. The loss of charge per second
  is such as would result from the production of about 20 ions of either sign in each
  cubic centimeter per second in air at atmospheric pressure.
