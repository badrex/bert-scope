tldr: William Rutherford investigates a new and simple series to compute the ratio
  of a circle's diameter to its circumference with high accuracy. He compares it to
  John Machin's series and provides a more efficient method for calculations. The
  resulting value of n is given to 208 decimal places, presumed to be accurate to
  the last figure.
