tldr: The article discusses the role of nerve growth factor (NGF) in mediating inflammatory
  pain in adult mammals. It presents evidence that NGF regulates the sensitivity of
  pain-signaling systems and is up-regulated in various inflammatory conditions. NGF's
  involvement in the development and maintenance of sensory neurons is also explored,
  highlighting its importance in pain-related behaviors.
