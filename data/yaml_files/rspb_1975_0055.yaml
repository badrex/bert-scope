tldr: The article discusses the potential existence of alien life forms and their
  bioenergetic processes. It explores the possibility of life based on RNA genomes
  and alternative energy carriers, such as GTP, ITP, XTP, and derivatives of uric
  acid, hypoxanthine, theobromine, caffeine, and theophylline. The author suggests
  that life on other planets or celestial bodies might be completely different from
  Earth's life, both biochemically and morphologically.
