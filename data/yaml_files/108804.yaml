tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the temperature of the melting
  point of mercury and the change of the elastic force of atmospheric air between
  32°F and 212°F. They developed an air thermometer and used it to measure the temperature,
  finding that the melting point of well-purified mercury is practically a constant
  temperature, regardless of the specimen or mass. This research contributed to the
  understanding of thermodynamics and temperature measurement.
