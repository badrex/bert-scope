tldr: The authors conducted experiments on chromium methylamine alum to study its
  thermal and magnetic properties at low temperatures. They determined the absolute
  temperature down to 0.01 K and found the Curie point at 0.7 K. The results were
  compared with theory and showed good agreement above the Curie point. The study
  enabled a comparison between the Curie points of two alums differing only in their
  monovalent cations.
