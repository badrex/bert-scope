tldr: Researchers have developed an NMR microscope with a 11.7 T operating frequency
  to generate high-resolution images of cellular structures in plant systems. The
  images reveal the effects of local magnetic susceptibility differences inside the
  sample, which can be used to study plant stem structures and improve understanding
  of their properties.
