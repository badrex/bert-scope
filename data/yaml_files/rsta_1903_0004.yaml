tldr: The author presents a new method for reducing a function of spherical coordinates
  to a series of spherical harmonics, focusing on definite integrals and tesseral
  functions. This method simplifies calculations and allows for the determination
  of coefficients independently of higher-degree terms. Applications include expressing
  constant quantities over a sphere and solving integrals involving tesseral functions.
