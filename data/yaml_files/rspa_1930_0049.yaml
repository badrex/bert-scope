tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the ranges of alpha particles from
  radium, thorium, thorium, and polonium in various gases. They found that the stopping
  powers of these gases were different, and the ranges in air for thorium, radium,
  and thorium were smaller than previously obtained values. The authors also tested
  Gaunt's theory of the stopping power of hydrogen, finding that it could be extended
  to molecular hydrogen with a new value of the ionization potential.
