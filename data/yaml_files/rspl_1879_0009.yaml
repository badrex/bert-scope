tldr: This article examines the relationship between the diurnal range of magnetic
  declination and horizontal force observed at the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, from
  1841 to 1877, and the period of solar spot frequency. The author finds a strong
  correlation between the magnetic and solar phenomena, with both showing an eleven-year
  cycle. The study also suggests that the annual inequalities of magnetic diurnal
  range may be subject to periodical variation, increasing at sunspot maxima and decreasing
  at sunspot minima.
