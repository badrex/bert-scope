semantic_tags:

tldr: The author studies the morphology, biology, and relationships of Archotermopsis
  wrou, Desn., a primitive termite species. They also investigate the presence of
  intestinal protozoa and their significance in the termite's biology. The author
  discusses the termite's polymorphism, suggesting a hypothesis based on Mendelian
  inheritance to explain the phenomenon. The study contributes to understanding the
  complex biology and taxonomy of termites and their symbiotic relationships with
  protozoa.
