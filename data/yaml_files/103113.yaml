tldr: In this article, Hauksbee describes his experiments on the time taken for different
  bodies of varying magnitudes and weights to descend in common air from a certain
  height. He uses a pendulum to measure the time and finds that air resistance affects
  the descent of the bodies. The experiments were conducted from the top of St. Paul's
  Church in London, with the balls dropped from a height of about 220 feet.
