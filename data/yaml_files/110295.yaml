tldr: In 1830, a new volcano erupted in the Mediterranean, and John Davy investigated
  the phenomenon. The volcano's crater contained saltwater and gas, and it emitted
  dense white vapor and black matter during eruptions. The surrounding sea was discolored
  by ashes and dust, and no strong odors were detected. The author's findings were
  mostly negative, similar to Sir Humphry Davy's observations of Vesuvius in 1828.
