tldr: The article investigates the impact of cadmium on cardiac fast Na channels in
  calf Purkinje fibres. It demonstrates that cadmium, a known calcium channel blocker,
  also blocks the low-affinity TTX-binding Na channel at concentrations below 1mm.
  This finding suggests a possible structural difference between various types of
  Na channels and provides insight into the molecular basis of the low sensitivity
  of cardiac Na channels to TTX. The study also helps clarify the effects of cadmium,
  a cardiotoxic environmental pollutant, on the conduction system of the heart.
