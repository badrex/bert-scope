tldr: The authors develop a covariant theory of strong interaction symmetries, focusing
  on the relativistic structure of meson multiplets, including spin 2 particles. They
  provide expressions for free Lagrangians, free propagators, and interaction Lagrangians
  for higher-order calculations. The study includes the 4212 and 5940 meson multiplets,
  which may contain some of the recently discovered resonances.
