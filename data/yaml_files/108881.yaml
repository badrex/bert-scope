tldr: The author, Peter Griess, describes a new series of nitrogen-substituted compounds
  derived from aniline and similar bases. These compounds are unstable in their free
  state but form stable compounds with various properties. One of the compounds, nitrate
  of diazobenzol, is highly explosive and can cause extreme destruction. The author
  also explains the process of analyzing the composition of these compounds, such
  as through the transformation of an aqueous solution into carbolic acid, nitrogen,
  and nitric acid.
