tldr: This article discusses the importance of destabilization in biological molecular
  recognition, emphasizing that weak binding interactions between small molecules
  and proteins are crucial for driving reactions and facilitating processes such as
  enzyme catalysis and coupled vectorial reactions. The author highlights the role
  of desolvation, physical distortion, and entropy loss in ground state destabilization,
  which enables the transition state to be reached more easily.
