tldr: This study investigates the response of normal men and women to changes in their
  environmental temperatures and ways of life. The research focuses on the acclimatization
  process, comparing the responses of British and Sudanese subjects in different climates.
  The results show that Sudanese subjects tended to gain weight in a temperate climate,
  while British subjects lost weight in a hot climate. The study also highlights the
  importance of understanding individual and ethnic differences in adapting to environmental
  temperature changes.
