tldr: The authors extend the concept of Farey sections to the quadratic field and
  study its properties. They use this theory to discuss the approximation of complex
  numbers by numbers of and and the related problem of the minimum of for, where are
  given. This work provides new proofs of Minkowski's theorems, which are more transparent
  than the original proofs.
