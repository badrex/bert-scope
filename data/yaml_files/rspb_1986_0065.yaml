tldr: The study investigates enzyme activities in symbiotic dinoflagellates from various
  marine organisms, focusing on phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEP-case) and other
  enzymes involved in (3-carboxylation reactions. The results show different levels
  of enzyme activities in algae from different hosts, suggesting the presence of functional
  P-carboxylation enzyme systems and a potential C4-like mechanism for carbon dioxide
  fixation in these symbiotic dinoflagellates.
