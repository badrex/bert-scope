tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical conductivity imparted
  to a vacuum by hot conductors, such as platinum and carbon. They found that the
  negative leakage from hot wires at low pressures is a definite function of the wire's
  temperature. The authors used the corpuscular theory of conduction in metals to
  explain their findings, and they concluded that the work required to force a corpuscle
  out of a metal varies approximately inversely as the cube root of the atomic volume
  of the metal. Their results provide a complete explanation of the phenomenon known
  as the Edison effect.
