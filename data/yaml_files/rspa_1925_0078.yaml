tldr: The authors study the intertraction phenomenon, where solutions mix by developing
  streamers or "pseudopodia" that start from the interface and move through the solutions.
  They find that this phenomenon is not caused by surface tension or capillary forces,
  but rather by the difference in the rates of diffusion of solutes in the solutions
  and the direction of gravity. The authors explain two cases of this phenomenon and
  provide possible explanations for the observed behavior.
