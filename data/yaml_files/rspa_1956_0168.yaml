tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of addition polymerization and its importance
  in chemical kinetics. They explain the process of radical growth and the role of
  radicals in initiating polymerization. The author also highlights the use of radioactive
  tracers to study the fate of radicals and the introduction of new terminal groups
  to create block or non-random macromolecules.
