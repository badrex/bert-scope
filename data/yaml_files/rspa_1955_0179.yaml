tldr: The author measures the interphase surface tension in superconducting aluminium
  using techniques previously applied to tin. The surface tension in aluminium is
  found to be several times larger than in tin, and it varies differently with temperature
  and purity of the specimen. The results are compared with predictions by Pippard
  and Bardeen, and it is shown that Pippard's theory is slightly more successful.
  The author also discusses the supercooling of aluminium specimens, which is explained
  in terms of a simple model based on the idea of coherence.
