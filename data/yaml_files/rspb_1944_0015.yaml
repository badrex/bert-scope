tldr: This study investigates the relationship between body temperature and the surrounding
  air in terrestrial annelids and molluscs, specifically focusing on oligochaetes
  and pulmonates. The research finds that snails can maintain a body temperature well
  below the surrounding air when fully extended, while earthworms have a relatively
  low upper thermal death-point, making them unsuitable for long-term survival in
  direct sunlight. The findings suggest that terrestrial annelids and molluscs have
  unique ways of adapting to land environments, with snails being more resistant to
  heat than native frogs.
