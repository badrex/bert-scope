tldr: This article discusses the ultrastructure and cytochemistry of the autonomic
  nervous system, focusing on large granular vesicles and the storage and release
  of neurotransmitters, particularly noradrenaline. The author presents findings on
  the distribution of these vesicles in different types of nerve fibers and the effects
  of reserpine on their contents. Additionally, the article explores the use of high-resolution
  autoradiography to study the cytochemistry of noradrenaline in sympathetic neurons.
