tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophin-3 (NT-3) in the development of
  the peripheral nervous system. It explains how NT-3 affects neuronal numbers in
  sensory and sympathetic ganglia during early development. The study found that NT-3
  can regulate cell numbers before the period of target-derived control and has different
  effects on sensory neurons during various phases of development.
