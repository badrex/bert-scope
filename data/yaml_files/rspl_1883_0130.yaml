tldr: The author investigates the electrochemical equivalent of silver and the absolute
  electromotive force of Clark cells. They find that the electrochemical equivalent
  of silver is 1.118 x 10^-3, in precise agreement with Kohlrausch's recent findings.
  The author also discusses the behavior of silver voltameters and the determination
  of electromotive force using standard cells, including a modified form of Clark
  cell with an amalgam instead of solid zinc.
