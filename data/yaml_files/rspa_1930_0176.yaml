tldr: The authors discovered that exposing a mixture of phosphine and oxygen to ultra-violet
  light lowers the pressure needed for an explosion. They found that a substance is
  formed by the light, which makes the mixture more explosive. This substance accumulates
  until it reaches a concentration that balances its formation and decay. The authors
  also found that the active substance is destroyed at the walls of the container,
  and only a small fraction of the collisions with the wall are effective in destroying
  it.
