tldr: The authors determined the coefficients of viscosity and mutual diffusion for
  atomic and molecular hydrogen mixtures. They used an improved version of Harteck's
  viscometer and analyzed the flow of the reacting gases. The results were in good
  agreement with the best theoretical values available at the time, providing a more
  accurate understanding of the transport properties of atomic hydrogen.
