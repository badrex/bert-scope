tldr: This study evaluates the use of higher taxa as a proxy for species-level biodiversity
  patterns using a large database of eastern Pacific marine molluscs. The research
  finds that while higher taxa can be useful for general species-level patterns, they
  cannot adequately resolve regional variations. The authors recommend calibrating
  genera as proxies for species-level patterns by using well-sampled local assemblages
  for regional studies.
