tldr: The authors developed a method to detect condensation in high-velocity steam
  using electrical resistance. They found that a wire's resistance changed sharply
  when it passed through the point where condensation began in a steam nozzle. This
  method could be used in pipes and turbine passages to study condensation behavior.
