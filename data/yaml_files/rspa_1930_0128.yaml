tldr: The authors investigated the hyper-fine structure of the arc spectrum of indium
  to determine if any lines had a quantized nuclear spin and a corresponding magnetic
  moment. They used a reflecting echelon grating to analyze the spectrum and found
  that the nucleus must possess one quantum of rotation. The results agreed with Fermi's
  theory of the interaction of nuclear and electron spins.
