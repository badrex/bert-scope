tldr: The article presents a continuum mechanics model for damage in composite materials,
  focusing on the characterization of damage through a set of internal vector field
  variables. The authors derive constitutive equations for the isothermal, small-deformation
  behavior of composite materials in a given damage state and discuss the usefulness
  of these relations in assessing damage development.
