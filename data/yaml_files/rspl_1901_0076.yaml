tldr: 'The author conducted experiments on frog skin to study electrical reactions
  and skin currents. They discovered that the normal current is negative and increases
  over time. The response to direct excitation is positive and influenced by factors
  such as temperature and strength of the excitation. The electrical response to indirect
  excitation through nerves is of three types: positive, mixed, or negative. The findings
  suggest that each effect is an algebraic sum of two opposite effects.'
