tldr: The study provides a detailed redescription of the postcranial skeletal anatomy
  of the Carboniferous tetrapod Greererpeton burkemorani, based on several well-preserved
  specimens. The analysis reveals that the vertebrae are rhachitomous and schizomerous,
  with neural arch elements in the atlas-axis complex consisting of paired pro- and
  atlas arches and a massive axis arch. The study also discusses the ribs, scales,
  appendicular skeleton, dermal pectoral girdle, pectoral limb, pelvic girdle, and
  pelvic limb of G. burkemorani. The findings contribute to understanding the early
  evolution of tetrapods and the sequence of characters diagnostic of smaller taxonomic
  groups.
