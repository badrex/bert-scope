tldr: The article investigates the process of immunological paralysis in mice by using
  bovine serum albumin (BSA) as an immunogen. The authors identify two zones of paralysis,
  one high in dosage and late in duration, and the other low and early. They propose
  an interpretation based on concomitant immunization and a double threshold of paralysis.
  The study confirms the highly specific nature of paralysis and its relationship
  to the immune response.
