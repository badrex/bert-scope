tldr: Edward Nairne discovered that electricity can cause iron wires to shorten in
  length when an electrical charge passes through them. He conducted experiments to
  demonstrate this phenomenon and found that the wires continued to shorten with each
  discharge of the battery. This discovery could have implications for the design
  and construction of electrical systems.
