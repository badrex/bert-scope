tldr: In March 1726, George Whiston observed four mock-suns, a rare meteorological
  phenomenon, in a garden at Kensington. He described the halo around the sun, the
  parhelia, and their colors. The upper part of the halo had a confused mixture of
  rainbow colors, and the parhelia had brightness and color similar to the upper part
  of the halo. This observation is significant as it provides insight into atmospheric
  optics and optical phenomena.
