tldr: In 1868, William Huggins used a spectroscope and a narrow slit to view a solar
  prominence without an eclipse. By limiting the light entering the telescope and
  using a piece of deep ruby glass to absorb unwanted light, the prominence was distinctly
  visible. Huggins planned to modify the method to make the outline of these objects
  more easily visible.
