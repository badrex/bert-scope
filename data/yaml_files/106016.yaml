tldr: In this account, Mr. Nicholson, a teacher of mathematics, describes a lightning
  storm he observed on March 1, 1774, near Wakefield, Yorkshire. He noticed the lightning
  affected horses and objects, such as the end of his stick with a brass ferule. The
  storm also produced beautiful streams of light resembling an Aurora Borealis. No
  thunder was heard during the storm, and a large ball of fire was seen passing under
  the zenith towards the southeast part of the horizon.
