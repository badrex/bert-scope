tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the disintegration of nitrogen and aluminum
  nuclei using alpha-particles. They found that the energy changes in the disintegration
  process can be used to determine the mass defects of the nuclei, providing insight
  into the structure of atomic nuclei. The results help explain the difficultly of
  certain types of disintegration and offer a picture of the nitrogen nucleus.
