tldr: This study investigates whether rats can form learning sets using olfactory
  stimuli. The authors found that although rats show progressive improvement in olfactory
  learning, they do not develop the abstract 'win-stay, lose-shift' strategy associated
  with learning set formation. This suggests that olfactory learning in rats may be
  rapid, but it does not involve higher-order cognitive processes.
