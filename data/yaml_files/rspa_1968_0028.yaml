tldr: The authors studied the freezing process of small supercooled water droplets
  as they fell through a controlled vertical temperature gradient in cold, purified
  air and other gases. They found that the median freezing temperature of the droplets
  was a function of their size and cooling rate, and that the results were consistent
  with the theory of homogeneous nucleation. This research provides valuable insights
  into the natural process of supercooled cloud droplets freezing while falling in
  the atmosphere.
