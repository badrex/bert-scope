tldr: The authors conducted research on the nucleoproteids found in the pancreas,
  thymus, and suprarenal gland, focusing on their optical activity. They discovered
  that nucleoproteids are dextrorotatory bodies, meaning they rotate plane-polarized
  light in a clockwise direction. This research helped expand the understanding of
  the complex albuminous substances found in the nucleated protoplasm of animal organs.
