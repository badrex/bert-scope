tldr: Edward Meyrick was a remarkable man who made significant contributions to the
  field of entomology, particularly in the study of Lepidoptera. He was a dedicated
  teacher and naturalist, and his work in reclassifying the order of Lepidoptera revolutionized
  the older artificial classification system. Meyrick's research focused on the principles
  of development and evolution, which he applied to his comprehensive studies of Microlepidoptera.
