tldr: This article explores the neuropsychology of lipreading, examining how it intersects
  with sensory and cognitive processes. It discusses the role of the right and left
  hemispheres in lipreading and face perception, and how different cognitive components
  of lipreading can be inferred from dissociations on various lipreading tasks. The
  article also highlights the potential connection between lipreading and reading
  processes, and the implications for understanding the organization of cognitive
  functions.
