tldr: This article discusses the measurement and interpretation of Earth's strain
  in Australia, with a focus on the Cooney Observatory. It describes various research
  programs and instruments used for strain determination, including rod, wire, and
  laser strain-meters. The Cooney Observatory's research program emphasizes instrument
  development and verification, aiming to improve established techniques for measuring
  Earth's crustal movements.
