tldr: The authors studied the electronic spectrum of nitrosomethane and found that
  the complex spectrum is due to torsional motion. They analyzed the vibrational and
  torsional frequencies and estimated the changes in the molecule's equilibrium geometry
  upon electronic excitation. The study provides insights into the molecular structure
  and behavior of nitrosomethane.
