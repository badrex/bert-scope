tldr: The author developed a new type of cylindrical lens that can be used for measuring
  astigmatism. The lens has a constant axis with varying refraction in the perpendicular
  meridian. It is made by mounting two concave cylindrical lenses with varying curvatures
  and sliding them along their axes. This lens allows for more accurate astigmatism
  measurements and can be used in various optical instruments.
