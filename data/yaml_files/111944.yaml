tldr: The author, B.C. Brodie, investigates the decomposition of various oxygenated
  substances by peroxide of hydrogen. The study includes the decomposition of permanganic
  acid, ferricyanide, hypochlorite, and chromic acid. The author concludes that the
  oxygen in different peroxides behaves similarly and that the peculiarities in their
  reactions are due to the physical conditions and the substances they are associated
  with.
