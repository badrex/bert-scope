tldr: The authors measured the rate at which negative ions nucleate charged vortex
  rings in isotopically pure superfluid helium. They used a novel electrostatic induction
  technique to study the breakdown of superfluidity and found that the nucleation
  rate is influenced by temperature and pressure. The experimental data supports the
  quantum transition model for vortex nucleation, which suggests that the process
  is probabilistic in nature.
