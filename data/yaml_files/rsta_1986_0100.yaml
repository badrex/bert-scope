tldr: The author surveys tetrahedral structures in crystal chemistry, focusing on
  structures built from regular tetrahedral groups. The study covers various types
  of structures, including finite, one-dimensional, two-dimensional, and three-dimensional
  structures, and discusses their classifications based on coordination numbers and
  topological features. The research provides insights into the construction and properties
  of tetrahedral structures and their importance in crystal chemistry.
