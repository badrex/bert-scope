tldr: The authors used X-ray analysis to study the molecular structure of actin and
  myosin proteins in muscle under various conditions. They discovered that the long
  molecules in muscle are arranged in a hexagonal array and that the presence of ATP
  affects the electron density between these molecules. This research provides insights
  into the mechanism of muscle contraction.
