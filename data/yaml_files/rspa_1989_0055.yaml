tldr: The authors calculate local three-spin correlations in the free-fermion and
  planar Ising models, using a method called'sum over star' identities. They find
  that these correlations are related to the spontaneous magnetization and can be
  expressed as algebraic functions of the Boltzmann weights. This research provides
  a better understanding of the physical properties of these models and can be applied
  to other exactly solved models in statistical mechanics.
