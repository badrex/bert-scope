tldr: The study examines the behavioral interactions between the swimming sea anemone
  Boloceroides mcmurrichi and the nudibranch Berghia major. When the aeolid nudibranch
  comes into contact with the anemone, the anemone detaches its pedal disc and swims
  away. This response is due to a chemical substance in the aeolid. The anemone's
  ability to swim and its tendency to shed tentacles (autotomy) help keep predation
  levels manageable. The anemone's tentacles are used as food by the nudibranch, and
  the two species have a mutually adaptive relationship.
