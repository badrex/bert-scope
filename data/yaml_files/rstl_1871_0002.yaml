tldr: The author conducted chemical and physiological experiments on living cinchona
  plants to study the formation and functions of the alkaloids, such as quinine, cinchonidine,
  and cinchonine. They found that most of the alkaloids exist in the bark in an insoluble
  form, as tannates, while a small portion exists in solution as quinates. The author
  also investigated the presence of alkaloids in different parts of the cinchona plant,
  such as the leaves, wood, and seeds, and found that the bark is the richest source
  of alkaloids.
