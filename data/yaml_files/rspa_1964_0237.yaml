tldr: 'The authors describe two methods for producing efficient X-ray gratings for
  spectroscopy: one using a conventionally ruled grating and the other a photographic
  process. These N.P.L. gratings show improved diffraction efficiency compared to
  conventional gratings, making them suitable for use in various applications, including
  space research and plasma analysis.'
