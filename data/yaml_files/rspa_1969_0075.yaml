tldr: 'The authors analyze the morphological stability of a two-dimensional nucleus
  growing on a substrate, focusing on two distinct cases: a conservative system and
  a non-conservative system. They find that the conservative system is less stable,
  while the non-conservative system is inherently more stable and shape-preserving.
  The study helps in understanding the growth and shape of nuclei in materials science.'
