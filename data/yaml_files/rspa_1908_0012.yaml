tldr: Sir G. H. Darwin examines the stability of pear-shaped figures of rotating liquid
  masses, discussing the disagreement with M. Liapounoff on the sign of a certain
  function. He reevaluates his previous computations using improved methods and expresses
  hope for further research on the topic.
