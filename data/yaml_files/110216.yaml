tldr: The author studied the stomach of the Zariffa, a ruminant quadruped, and found
  that it has four cavities. The stomach lining has a similar efflorescence to that
  of a bullock, but it is more prominent. The second cavity lacks the cellular structure
  found in other ruminants, while the third and fourth cavities exhibit no peculiarities.
  The Zariffa's diet of acacia leaves and twigs is so succulent that it does not need
  to be moistened in the second stomach, unlike grass-eating animals. Three drawings
  of the stomach structure accompany the paper.
