tldr: This study investigates the production and respiration rates of the Red Sea
  coral Stylophora pistillata at different depths. Corals at 35 meters have increased
  branch density, decreased zooxanthellae density, and higher chlorophyll a per algal
  cell compared to those at 3 meters. These adaptations help corals at deeper depths
  cope with limited photosynthetically active radiation. Deeper corals have a higher
  photosynthetic efficiency but lower respiration rates. The study concludes that
  deeper corals have an obligate requirement for heterotrophically obtained carbon,
  while shallower corals are more photosynthetic in terms of carbon required for respiration.
