tldr: The authors studied electron energy-loss spectra of triatomic molecules like
  CO2, N2O, COS, CS2, and SO2. They compared the observed Rydberg series with vacuum
  ultraviolet absorption spectra and identified new lowest members and series. The
  quantum defects of these series were discussed in terms of the orbitals of the active
  electrons. The results provide insights into the optical and generalized oscillator
  strengths, forbidden and allowed transitions, and Rydberg and auto-ionizing transitions
  in the continua of these molecules.
