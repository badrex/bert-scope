tldr: The authors observed two-photon transitions from the 5²P and 5²P states of indium
  to high-lying 2P and 2F states. They discovered a hybrid resonance through a dissociative
  intermediate state of In2 and discussed the atomic and molecular processes involved
  in the two-photon absorption. The study provides insights into the spectroscopy
  of elements with less volatility than alkali metals.
