tldr: This article examines the regulation of chloroplast development in plants, focusing
  on transcriptional, translational, and post-translational controls. The authors
  study the levels of key proteins and their corresponding mRNAs during the de-etiolation
  of pea seedlings under different light conditions. They find that phytochrome and
  protochlorophyllide play crucial roles in coordinating chloroplast development,
  with phytochrome regulating aspects of development in the nucleus, cytoplasm, and
  chloroplast.
