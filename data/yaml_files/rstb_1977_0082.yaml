tldr: The author discusses the geological structure of Antarctica and its role in
  understanding the evolution of Gondwanaland. Antarctica's geological position has
  allowed for the correlation of events throughout Gondwanaland and the deduction
  of possible relations between geological developments in the supercontinent and
  in the Pacific. The author highlights the contrast between tectonic changes in the
  interior of Gondwanaland and extensive deformation within the Ross and younger orogenic
  belts close to the Pacific, providing insights into the pre-break-up deformation
  of Gondwanaland and movements of the surrounding ocean floor.
