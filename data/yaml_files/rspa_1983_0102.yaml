tldr: The authors studied the dispersion of reactive species, specifically atomic
  hydrogen, in a flowing gas. They developed a theoretical model that takes into account
  irreversible loss of the reactive species by reaction on the tube wall and their
  reversible adsorption and desorption at the wall. The model shows that the longitudinal
  distribution of the reactive species becomes Gaussian eventually, and the dispersion
  of the reactive species increases linearly with time.
