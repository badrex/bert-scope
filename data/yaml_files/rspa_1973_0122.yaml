tldr: This article explores the phase integral method for studying the coupling between
  characteristic waves in the ionosphere at vertical incidence. The author extends
  the method, showing that previous conclusions must be amended. The study focuses
  on the behavior of the indices in the complex height plane and the coupling points,
  which play a crucial role in understanding radio wave propagation in the ionosphere.
