tldr: The authors studied the 3d and 4s photoabsorption spectra of Cr I using synchrotron
  radiation. They found that the spectra are simple and explained this within the
  spectator electrons approximation. The more intense transitions can be arranged
  in Rydberg series, and a prominent series of transmission windows arises by double
  excitation. A detailed analysis is presented, supported by ab initio Hartree-Fock
  calculations and comparisons with semi-empirical calculations.
