tldr: The authors examine the efficiency of muscular work and the human body's ability
  to transform energy. They discuss various methods of calculating efficiency and
  propose a new method based on the first derivative of heat production with respect
  to work. The study also highlights the importance of factors such as circulation
  and air currents in affecting the efficiency of muscular work.
