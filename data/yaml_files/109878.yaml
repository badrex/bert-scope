tldr: The author, Francis John Hyde Wollaston, developed a thermometrical barometer
  for measuring altitudes with greater accuracy and convenience than previous methods.
  The instrument measures the variations in heat of boiling water corresponding to
  changes in atmospheric pressure and barometer height. Wollaston describes the construction
  and use of the instrument, as well as experiments conducted to test its accuracy.
