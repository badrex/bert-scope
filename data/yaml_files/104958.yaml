tldr: A 94-year-old man suffered severe burns and injuries when he was caught in a
  fire at the Eddy-stone Lighthouse. He accidentally swallowed melted lead from a
  lantern, which caused stomach ulcers and inflammation. Despite the extreme pain
  and complications, the man survived for 12 days before passing away. The author
  shares this case study to demonstrate the possibility of surviving such an incident
  and to provide insight into the effects of melted lead on the human body.
