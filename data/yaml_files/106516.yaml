tldr: Nathanael Pigott discovered three new double stars in 1779 and shared his observations
  with the Royal Society. He used a three-foot achromatic telescope to determine the
  right ascensions and declinations of these stars. Pigott also developed a method
  to observe faint stars by using the transit instrument's wires, which could potentially
  be useful for other astronomers. The article includes the coordinates of the discovered
  double stars.
