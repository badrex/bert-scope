tldr: The authors study the motion of an elliptic cylinder in a fluid with constant
  vorticity. They derive equations of motion and calculate the pressure and forces
  acting on the cylinder. The study includes various cases of motion, such as uniform
  shear motion and rotation, and provides insights into the behavior of the cylinder
  in different scenarios.
