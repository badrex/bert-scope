tldr: The authors studied the absorption and diffusion of hydrogen and deuterium in
  tantalum at low temperatures. They observed large isotope effects and found that
  the ratio of diffusion coefficients for hydrogen and deuterium was approximately
  220 at 78 K, which diminished as the temperature increased. The results suggest
  that quantum mechanical tunnelling occurs between adjacent sites in the tantalum
  lattice.
