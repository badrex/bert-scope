tldr: Michael Faraday conducted experiments with a living Gymnotus fish to study its
  electric force and compare it with ordinary and voltaic electricity. He found that
  the electric current in the Gymnotus flows from its anterior parts through the water
  to the posterior parts. Faraday hoped that this research could help establish a
  relationship between electric and nervous powers.
