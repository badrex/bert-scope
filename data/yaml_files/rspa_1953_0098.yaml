tldr: The authors investigated the kinetics of the photo-oxidation of benzaldehyde
  in decane solution. They found that the rate of the reaction was proportional to
  the first power of the benzaldehyde concentration and the square root of the intensity
  of the absorbed light. The reaction was independent of oxygen pressure. The study
  suggests that the dehydrogenation of the aldehyde by the peroxy radical is the rate-determining
  step in propagation, and the termination step involves the interaction of two peroxy
  radicals.
