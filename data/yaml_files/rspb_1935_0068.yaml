tldr: Researchers treated male mice with oestrogenic compounds for 50 days or more
  to study their effects on cancer incidence. They observed abnormal structures, such
  as cysts and tubules, in the mice's reproductive system. These structures were lined
  with squamous keratinizing epithelium and were possibly remnants of the Mullerian
  duct, brought to view due to metaplastic changes induced by the oestrogenic compounds.
  Further research is needed to understand the normal occurrence of these structures.
