tldr: This article presents a powerful approximate solution to the Bloch equation
  by introducing the effective potential matrix, which is closely related to the potential
  in which particles move. The method allows for non-perturbative calculations of
  the density matrix and can be used for Hartree self-consistent field calculations
  on atoms and defect solids.
