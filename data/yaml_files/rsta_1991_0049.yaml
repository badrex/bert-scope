  Zones: Evidence from Cascadia Accretionary Prism'

tldr: This article investigates fluid expulsion and diagenetic carbonate deposition
  in subduction zones, specifically in the Cascadia accretionary prism off Oregon.
  The authors find that fluid expulsion occurs due to compaction and cementation of
  methane-rich pore waters, and that the extent and position of carbonate deposits
  on the accretionary prism indicate the magnitude and structural control of past
  fluid expulsion. The study provides insights into the processes occurring in subduction
  zones and the role of fluids in shaping these environments.
