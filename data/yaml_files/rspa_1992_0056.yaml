tldr: The author investigates the two-dimensional flow at low Reynolds numbers, specifically
  the motion of an elliptic cylinder. They use a singular perturbation problem approach,
  finding a solution of the Stokes equations that satisfies the boundary conditions
  on the body and matches the outer solution in the matching region. The study provides
  an unambiguous result for the lift on an elliptic cylinder at incidence and demonstrates
  the relationship between two-dimensional flow and equivalent three-dimensional flow.
