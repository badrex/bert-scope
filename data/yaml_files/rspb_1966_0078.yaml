tldr: The authors studied the photoassimilation of glucose in Chlorella and its relation
  to glycollic acid production. They found that glucose enters the photosynthetic
  carbon reduction cycle and leads to increased glycollic acid formation under certain
  conditions. The addition of isonicotinyl hydrazide (INH) stimulates glycollic acid
  and glycine production, but does not significantly affect the distribution of 14C
  between the carbon atoms of the glucose units.
