tldr: This article explores the intensity of light reflected from transparent substances,
  focusing on the influence of a uniform layer on the surface. The author investigates
  the effect of a layer of gradual transition and compares the results with experimental
  data, finding that certain laws of refractive index provide a closer match to the
  observed phenomena.
