tldr: The article discusses the evolutionary systematics and unique morphological
  features of the Trigoniidae family of bivalve molluscs. The Trigoniidae were dominant
  in shallow-burrowing and warm, shallow seas during the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous
  periods. The family's advanced features, such as efficient locomotion and muscular
  feet, allowed them to adapt to their environment. However, they suffered a mass
  extinction at the end of the Mesozoic era, leaving only the genus Neotrigonia, which
  has since evolved and adapted to different habitats.
