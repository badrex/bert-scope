tldr: The authors extend the method of successive approximations to construct relativistic
  models of gravitational fields due to symmetrical systems of bodies. They prove
  that the critical conditions are satisfied if certain symmetry requirements are
  met, allowing for the construction of models for Newtonian prototypes with density,
  stress, and velocity invariant under specific transformations.
