tldr: The authors cloned two potassium channel genes, NGK1 and NGK2, from neuroblastoma
  cells and studied their properties in Xenopus oocytes. They found that NGK1 and
  NGK2 channels have different activation and inactivation kinetics and pharmacological
  sensitivities. The NGK2 current has a more positive threshold potential and faster
  inactivation during a depolarizing pulse. The authors also discovered that both
  NGK1 and NGK2 proteins can form heteromultimeric K+ channels in addition to homomultimeric
  channels, which may be responsible for the native transient outward current with
  slow inactivation in NG108-15 hybrid cells.
