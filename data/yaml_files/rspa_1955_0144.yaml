tldr: This article discusses the molecular orbital theory of chemical valency and
  its application to the energy in higher approximations. It explains that bond energies
  in saturated molecules are nearly additive, while in conjugated molecules, this
  is not the case. The authors provide equations for determining the best orbitals
  and coefficients for an approximate wave function, and they explore the relationship
  between energy and orbital equations.
