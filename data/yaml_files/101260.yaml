tldr: Francis Smethwick, a fellow of the Royal Society, invented a new method of grinding
  non-spherical optical lenses. He demonstrated the effectiveness of these lenses
  in telescopes and reading glasses, which provided clearer and more accurate images.
  Smethwick also showcased burning-glasses that could warm objects at a distance and
  even ignite materials. The Royal Society encouraged him to continue refining his
  invention and share his techniques with others.
