tldr: This study investigates the effect of temperature on air viscosity using a constant
  volume method and vapor jackets to maintain precise temperatures. The results confirm
  that Sutherland's law holds true over the examined range, and a value of 118 is
  found for Sutherland's constant. The findings support the validity of previous observations
  and challenge the accuracy of some earlier experiments.
