revised_title: Pressure-Concentration Equilibria in Ferric Oxide Gels with Ethyl Alcohol,
  Benzene, and Water

tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the pressure-concentration equilibria
  between ferric oxide gels and various liquids, including water, ethyl alcohol, and
  benzene. They found that the absorption of these vapours into the gel did not result
  in the liberation of gas, except in the case of water. The study focused on understanding
  the behavior of the ferric oxide gel with different liquids and the factors affecting
  the equilibria.
