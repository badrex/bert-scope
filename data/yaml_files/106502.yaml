tldr: John Goodricke observed the periodic variation of the brightness of the star
  Algol and discovered that it changes from the second to the fourth magnitude in
  about three and a half hours, and then back to the second magnitude in the same
  time. The whole cycle takes about seven hours, and the variation likely recurs every
  two days and twenty-one hours. Goodricke's findings were significant for understanding
  the behavior of variable stars and inspired further astronomical investigations.
