tldr: This article provides a review of the basic equations and approximations used
  in magneto-hydrodynamics, a field that studies the motion of fluids in the presence
  of magnetic fields. It covers the scope of the subject, the electromagnetic and
  hydrodynamic equations, and the effects of motion and electromagnetic forces on
  fluid dynamics. The article also discusses the limitations of the macroscopic theory
  and the conditions under which it can be applied.
