tldr: This article discusses the author's research on the repulsion resulting from
  radiation. The author examines the repulsion exerted by a flame on various coated
  disks, such as lampblack, chemical precipitates, and other materials, suspended
  in a vacuum. The study investigates the effects of different types of radiation
  and materials, leading to the development of an improved radiometer called the otheoscope.
