tldr: This article discusses the contributions of Maxwell, Jenkin, and Cotterill to
  the development of the theory of statically-indeterminate structures in civil engineering.
  It highlights how their work helped solve the problem of calculating forces within
  frame structures due to applied loads and how their methods and principles are still
  relevant today.
