tldr: This article presents a general framework for mathematical modeling of heat
  and mass transfer in agricultural grain drying. The authors deduce equations for
  four basic types of convective grain driers and discuss the differences between
  their models and those of other researchers. The study aims to provide a three-dimensional
  formulation to help focus on the assumptions inherent in various models and to improve
  the understanding of the drying process.
