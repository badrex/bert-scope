tldr: The author, Erasmus Darwin, presents a new theory for the ascent of vapour,
  challenging the opinion of Henry Eeles. Darwin argues that the expansion of heated
  materials and the affinity of some materials to heat can explain the ascent of vapours
  without relying on the concept of electric fire. He also discusses the role of heat
  transfer and specific gravity in various phenomena, such as the behavior of bismuth
  and zinc, and the formation of buff coverings in inflammatory blood.
