tldr: This article discusses the diffusion of liquids and solubility of substances
  in solutions. The author conducts experiments with carbonic acid and nitrous oxide
  gases dissolved in water to understand the process of diffusion in liquids. The
  findings show that the diffusion of liquid carbonic acid is a slow process compared
  to its gaseous diffusion, and that the diffusion of liquids is not significantly
  affected by accidental disturbances. The author also investigates the role of solution
  density in the diffusion of various salts.
