tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of physical and chemical
  agents on the nervous system. He discovered that the electrogenic state of nerves
  can be induced by momentary and slight voltaic currents and can induce phenomena
  of voltaism in other nerves. The author also observed that new and superadded circles
  can be created, resulting in muscular contractions. He concluded by stating that
  he avoided theoretical views and focused on the accurate detail of experiments.
