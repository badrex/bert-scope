tldr: The authors studied the energy distribution of ions and electrons in a hydrogen
  discharge using a small probe. They found that the energy distributions of positive
  ions and electrons vary along the striation, with the maximum energy of positive
  ions observed in the striation tail. The results confirm the findings of Boyd and
  Twiddy and provide new information on the energy distributions of positive ions.
