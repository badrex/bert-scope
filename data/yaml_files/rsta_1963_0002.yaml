tldr: This article extends the work on spherical harmonics and their expansions for
  crystallographic point groups. The authors develop a new method for calculating
  auxiliary functions and provide fully orthogonal expansions for the cubic groups
  up to and including l. They also discuss the orthogonality of the expansions and
  the use of operators to generate functions that transform like the columns of irreducible
  representations.
