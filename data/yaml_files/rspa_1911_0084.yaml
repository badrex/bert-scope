tldr: The author examines the iron flame spectrum and compares it to the spectra of
  sun-spots and lower-type stars. They find that the lines in the iron flame spectrum
  are generally weakened in sun-spot spectra, and that the majority of these weakened
  lines are also relatively strong in the oxy-hydrogen flame spectrum. The author
  also notes that the lines in the more refrangible part of the spectrum are mainly
  unaffected in passing from the solar spectrum to that of Arcturus.
