tldr: The article discusses the implications of identifying a DNA restriction fragment
  length polymorphism closely linked to Huntington's disease on the short arm of chromosome
  4. This allows for presymptomatic prediction in first-degree relatives at risk,
  aiding in genetic counseling. However, there are serious ethical reservations concerning
  predictive tests in the absence of effective therapy. The author examines the situation
  in a stable population in south Wales, where a genetic register for Huntington's
  disease has been developed, and discusses the implications of these new developments
  for prevention and prediction.
