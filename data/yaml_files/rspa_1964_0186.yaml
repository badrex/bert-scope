tldr: The authors investigated the effects of ionizing radiations on Ni and Ni crystals
  using paramagnetic resonance methods. They found that when exposed to radiation,
  Ni ions trap electrons and form ions associated with various vacancy configurations.
  The study describes the annealing behavior of these complexes in room temperature
  and low-temperature irradiated crystals, as well as the symmetry of the complexes
  and their ground states. The fluorine hyperfine structure of the spectra is also
  investigated, providing insights into the environment of the Ni ions.
