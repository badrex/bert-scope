tldr: The authors propose a new approach to the atomic valence state, called the resonance
  valence state, which uses a valence bond wavefunction for molecules. This approach
  allows resonance among pairing schemes for ligand orbitals, making it easier to
  calculate molecular energies and simplifying the valence state compared to the perfect-pairing
  valence state. The resonance valence state can be a linear combination of terms
  with the highest multiplicity, and its energy can be directly available from spectral
  term values in many cases.
