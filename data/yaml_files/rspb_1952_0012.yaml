tldr: This study examines the distribution of nicotinic acid in wheat and maize, finding
  that the aleurone layer contains 82% of the total nicotinic acid in wheat and approximately
  60% in maize. The scutellum contains 1.3% of the total in wheat and around 11% in
  maize. The research also shows that sweet maize has a higher concentration of nicotinic
  acid in its carbohydrate endosperm compared to flint maize.
