tldr: This article discusses the penetration of particles into regions of negative
  kinetic energy using the method of geometrical optics. It shows that in multi-dimensional
  problems, an upper limit for the probability of penetration can be derived, and
  in some cases, the method provides the actual value of this probability. The study
  focuses on the behavior of particles in potential fields and the wave function,
  using the Hamilton-Jacobi equation to analyze the lines of steepest gradient and
  determine the probability density at specific points.
