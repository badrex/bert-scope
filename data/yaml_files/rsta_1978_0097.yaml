tldr: This study investigates the changes in sea level on the northern Great Barrier
  Reef during the Holocene epoch. The authors found that present sea level was reached
  around 6000 years ago, and identified oscillations in sea level since then. However,
  they were unable to separate eustatic from non-eustatic components of the changes.
  The research highlights the importance of detailed local studies to establish accurate
  sea level histories.
