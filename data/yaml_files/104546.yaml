tldr: Dr. James Mounsey describes the everlasting fire in Persia, a natural phenomenon
  that rises from the ground in the Abscheron Peninsula. The fire is used for heating,
  cooking, and even worship by Indian priests and devotees. The fire is so hot that
  it can turn stones to lime, but it does not produce smoke or smell. Mounsey also
  discusses the white naphtha wells nearby, which are used for medicinal purposes
  and as fuel. The fire and naphtha have significant impacts on the local culture
  and daily life.
