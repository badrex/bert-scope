tldr: The authors studied the resistance to motion of a thread of mercury in a glass
  tube, considering both surface tension and viscosity forces. They developed an expression
  for the pressure necessary to drive the drop with a given velocity and tested their
  formula using experiments with different tube diameters and mercury threads.
