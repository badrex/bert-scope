tldr: This article explores the evolutionary relationship between animals and plants,
  focusing on the morphological adaptations of insects in relation to their plant
  hosts. It highlights the challenges insects face while feeding on plants, such as
  dealing with plant surfaces, hardness, and toughness. The article discusses various
  adaptations in tarsi, rostra, and mouthparts that have evolved to overcome these
  challenges and improve the insects' ability to feed, escape predators, and survive
  on their host plants.
