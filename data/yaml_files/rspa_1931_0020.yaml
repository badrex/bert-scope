tldr: This study investigates the hardening of metals, specifically high-speed steel
  containing 18% tungsten, using rotating magnetic fields. The researchers found that
  the hardness of the metal increased significantly after being exposed to a single
  turn in the magnetic field. This discovery could have implications for the heat
  treatment of various materials, including Duralumin.
