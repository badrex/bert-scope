tldr: 'The article investigates the spontaneous interparticle percolation of small
  particles falling through a fixed bed of larger particles, a process relevant to
  particle mixing and static mixers. Two main cases are studied: elastic and inelastic
  interactions between particles. The percolation velocity, diffusion tensor, and
  Peclet numbers are calculated and compared with experimental results, providing
  insights into the behavior of particles in these systems.'
