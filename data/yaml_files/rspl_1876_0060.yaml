tldr: The author investigates the diurnal variations of wind and barometric pressure
  at Bermuda, discovering a system of diurnal wind currents that move synchronously
  with the diurnal variation of barometric pressure. This study supports the idea
  that these currents are a universal phenomenon and can help explain the diurnal
  variations of the barometer. The author also discusses the implications of these
  findings on the understanding of global wind patterns and weather systems.
