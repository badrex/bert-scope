tldr: This article investigates the chemical reactions between nitric acid and certain
  metals, such as copper, mercury, and bismuth. The authors found that the presence
  of nitrous acid affects the dissolution of these metals in nitric acid. They also
  discovered that the amount of metal dissolved and the amount of nitrous acid present
  are related variables when the nitric acid is in excess. The study provides insights
  into the chemical changes and reactions that occur during these processes.
