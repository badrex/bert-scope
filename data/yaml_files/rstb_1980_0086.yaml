tldr: The article explores the concept of motion perception and its relation to spatial
  representation. It discusses the phenomenon of 'apparent motion,' where a target
  appears to move continuously even when it makes discrete spatial jumps. The author
  proposes that the visual system's ability to perceive motion is limited by physiological
  constraints and that understanding these constraints can help us better understand
  how the visual system processes motion.
