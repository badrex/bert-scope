tldr: This study investigates the distribution of blood vessels in the lungs, focusing
  on the pulmonary and bronchial arteries. The author found that the pulmonary artery
  does not connect with other arteries, while the bronchial arteries have their own
  separate distribution. The bronchial membrane is richly supplied with a unique vascular
  plexus, which ultimately connects to the pulmonary veins. The study also discusses
  the injection process and the apparatus used to observe the blood vessels in the
  lungs.
