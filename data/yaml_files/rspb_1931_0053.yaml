tldr: The authors investigate the sandflies of the Mediterranean basin, focusing on
  their bionomics and distribution. They describe the identification methods for various
  sandfly species, emphasizing the importance of distinguishing between them due to
  their differing capacities to transmit disease. The study also discusses the differences
  in bionomics and armature between the Minutus group and the erect-haired group of
  sandflies.
