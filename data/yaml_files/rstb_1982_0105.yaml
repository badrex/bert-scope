tldr: This article discusses the mechanism of interferon production, focusing on the
  production of interferon-a and interferon-p. The author explains how cells are induced
  to produce interferons when treated with viruses or double-stranded RNA. The article
  also explores the molecular basis of gene expression and the control mechanisms
  involved in interferon production.
