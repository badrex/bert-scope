tldr: This study investigates the effect of potassium on the resting metabolism of
  the frog's sartorius muscle. The research finds that increasing potassium ion concentration
  in the surrounding fluid significantly increases the rate of heat production and
  oxygen consumption in the muscle. The findings suggest that a partial depolarization
  of the muscle fibers' surface can cause a change in internal organization, releasing
  some chemical processes that are usually activated by excitation. The study has
  implications for understanding the control of metabolic and contractile events within
  muscle fibers.
