tldr: The author presents a mathematical model for calculating wave profiles and surface
  elevation caused by ships. The model is based on the velocity potential of doublets
  and can be applied to various ship shapes. The results show the local disturbance
  and wave patterns created by the ship, which can be used to improve ship design
  and understand wave resistance.
