tldr: The authors measured the photoelectron spectra of allene, deuteroallenes, and
  tetrafluoroallene in the 6-20 eV range. Allene showed three vertical ionization
  potentials, with the first band involving ionization from an n orbital and displaying
  complex vibrational structure. The spectra of the deuteroallenes had similar bands,
  with vibrational intervals affected by the isotope effect. Tetrafluoroallene's photoelectron
  spectrum had three bands, with the first band associated with ionization from an
  n orbital and showing a coupled vibrational frequency of about 1450 cm-1. The infrared
  and Raman spectra of tetrafluoroallene were measured to determine molecular vibration
  frequencies, and all eleven frequencies were assigned.
