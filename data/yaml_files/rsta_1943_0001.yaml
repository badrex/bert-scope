tldr: This article examines the properties, modes of formation, and destruction of
  negative ions of atomic and molecular oxygen. Using quantal theory, the authors
  interpret the experimental information and discuss various attachment, detachment,
  and electron scattering phenomena. The study is important for understanding upper
  atmospheric and discharge tube phenomena, with implications for the ionosphere and
  negative ions in general.
