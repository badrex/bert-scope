revised_title: Influence of Competition between Nodule Bacteria Strains on Legume
  Infection

tldr: The authors studied the competition between related strains of nodule bacteria
  and its impact on the infection of legume plants. They discovered that in the presence
  of a dominant strain, other strains may be almost completely checked in their multiplication
  outside the plant. This dominance is independent of the strain's effectiveness in
  nitrogen fixation. The findings have implications for the practical application
  of knowledge about symbiotic nodule bacteria and their role in plant growth.
