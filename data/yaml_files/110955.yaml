tldr: The author, Francis Ronalds, describes a new type of photographic instrument
  called the Photo-Electrograph, which can record meteorological and magnetical data.
  The instrument uses a voltaic electrometer, a slit, and a photographic paper to
  create a self-registering image of the atmospheric electric tension. The instrument
  can also be adapted to record temperature, barometric pressure, and magnetic data,
  making it a versatile tool for scientific research.
