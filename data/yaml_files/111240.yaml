tldr: The author, Arthur Hill Hassall, discovered that indigo, a blue colorant, can
  be formed in human urine through a process of oxidation when exposed to air. This
  finding challenges previous theories about the presence of cyanurine in urine and
  raises questions about the relationship between indigo, hematin, and other animal
  colorants.
