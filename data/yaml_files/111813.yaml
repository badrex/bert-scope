tldr: The author proposes a decimal compass card with 36 points of ten degrees each
  to simplify navigation for mariners. This innovation eliminates the need for converting
  degrees to points and vice versa, reduces errors, and improves the efficiency of
  navigation. The author also suggests that the new system can be easily integrated
  with existing charts and compasses.
