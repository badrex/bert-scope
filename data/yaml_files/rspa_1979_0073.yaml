tldr: The authors analyze the gas-liquid surface properties of the penetrable sphere
  model using the van der Waals approximation. They compare the results with the mean-field
  approximation and find that the van der Waals approach is a tolerable approximation
  at temperatures down to about half the critical point but unsatisfactory at lower
  temperatures. A generalization proposed by Yang et al. (1976) is shown to overcome
  this difficulty and provide better results at all temperatures.
