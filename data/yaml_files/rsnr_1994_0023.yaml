tldr: This article discusses the story of John Gedde, a Scottish beekeeper who claimed
  to be the inventor of a unique beehive design. Gedde's beehive, known as the supered
  box-hive, was presented to the Royal Society, which helped promote its popularity.
  Gedde eventually patented the design and marketed it as a solution for beekeeping
  that prevented swarming and improved honey production. The article explores the
  impact of the Royal Society's involvement in the promotion and marketing of Gedde's
  invention.
