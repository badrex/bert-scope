tldr: The author discusses the adaptation of anaerobic organisms, particularly Escherichia
  coli, to life without oxygen. They explore the mechanisms that allow these organisms
  to switch between aerobic and anaerobic environments and the role of the citric
  acid cycle in this process. The author also highlights the challenges posed by oxygen
  toxicity and the importance of understanding these adaptations for biotechnology
  and medicine.
