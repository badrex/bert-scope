tldr: This article discusses the development and applications of quantum theory in
  predicting the properties of solid materials. It explains the use of models like
  jellium, pseudopotentials, and the local density approximation to calculate electronic,
  structural, and vibrational properties of solids. The author highlights successful
  predictions and future directions in the field of condensed matter physics.
