tldr: The authors discuss the impact of solvents on molecular energy levels and their
  effect on infra-red spectroscopy. They examine how the vibration frequencies of
  molecules change when dissolved in solvents containing halogen atoms, and explore
  the relationship between the solvent's electron density and the vibration frequencies.
  The study also investigates the variation of band intensity and the significance
  of dielectric effects on molecular interactions.
