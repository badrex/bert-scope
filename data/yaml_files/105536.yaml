tldr: In 1764, Samuel Dunn observed the solar eclipse using a reflecting telescope
  and a refracting telescope. He found that his watch lost 4 seconds of time compared
  to the clocks, and the eclipse ended at 12:03. Dunn's observations allowed him to
  create a map of the eclipse phases and confirm Brompton Park's location relative
  to Greenwich and Paris.
