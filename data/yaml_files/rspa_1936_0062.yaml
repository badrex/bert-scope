tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the temperature and ionization changes
  in the upper atmosphere. They discovered that the ionosphere moves bodily during
  the night, reaching a minimum height some 2 to 3 hours before sunrise. The results
  indicate that the upper atmosphere between 80 and 300 km contracts bodily during
  the early morning hours, suggesting that the atmosphere cools during this time.
