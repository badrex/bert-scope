tldr: This article investigates the solubility of bismuth, zinc, and tin in various
  alloys and how temperature affects their solubility. The authors found that the
  solubility of zinc in bismuth and tin, and bismuth in zinc and tin, increases with
  temperature. They also discovered that the solubility curves for these alloys lie
  below the base line, unlike lead-zinc-tin alloys. Additionally, the authors studied
  the behavior of bismuth, zinc, and silver alloys, finding that two definite compounds
  of zinc and silver are formed under specific conditions.
