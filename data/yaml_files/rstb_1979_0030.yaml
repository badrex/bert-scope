tldr: The article describes the characteristics and dynamics of Aldabra's seabird
  community, focusing on its ecological interactions and impact on the terrestrial
  ecosystem. It highlights the absence of certain species due to factors like predation,
  lack of nesting space, and insufficient feeding grounds. The seabird community plays
  a significant role in nutrient input to the terrestrial ecosystem, with consequences
  for the atoll's ecology as a whole. The article also discusses the influence of
  historical events, such as the introduction of rats and the impact of human activities,
  on the seabird community and its distribution.
