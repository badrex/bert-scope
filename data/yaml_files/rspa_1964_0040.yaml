tldr: The authors study the crystalline morphology of thin films of natural rubber
  when subjected to strain. They observe a transition from spherulitic to fibrillar
  structures as strain increases, with crystalline filaments growing perpendicular
  to the strain axis. The nucleation of these filaments is governed by the amount
  of strain, while their growth depends on temperature and time. This research provides
  insights into the molecular mechanisms of strain-induced crystallization in polymers.
