tldr: This article presents approximate solution methods for nonlinear acoustic propagation
  over long ranges, focusing on the generalized Burgers equations. The authors explore
  asymptotic solutions for weakly nonlinear acoustic waves under the influence of
  geometrical spreading and thermoviscous diffusion, considering both small diffusivity
  and large source disturbance amplitude. They discuss simpler approximate techniques
  and compare them with previously established methods, demonstrating their validity
  for various physical situations.
