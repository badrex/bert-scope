tldr: This article presents a kinematic description of the restrictions imposed on
  eye movements due to nonlinear interactions between desired changes in viewing direction
  and current eye position. The author develops a scheme that considers Listing's
  law as the basic relation between viewing direction and eye torsion, with convergence
  and head orientation modifying this relation. This descriptive scheme may help elucidate
  the control of eye torsion in the brainstem.
