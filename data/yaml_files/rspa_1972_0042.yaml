tldr: The authors study complex recurrent space-times, specifically focusing on Petrov
  type D and symmetric spaces. They show that complex recurrent spaces of type D are
  conformally recurrent spaces and decomposable into two 2-dimensional spaces of arbitrary
  curvature. The authors also determine the general metric of the complex recurrent
  space of Petrov type with recurrence vector proportional to the principal null vector
  of the Weyl tensor and discuss its properties.
