tldr: The author investigates the oxidation of ammonia in the human body and the presence
  of nitrous acid in urine. They find that ammonia is partly converted into nitrous
  acid during its passage through the body. The author also examines the effect of
  using phosphoric acid instead of sulfuric acid in urine distillation and its impact
  on nitrous acid detection. The study concludes that a delicate method is required
  to detect nitrous acid in urine after ammonia consumption, but it does not prove
  that a larger quantity cannot be lost during the extraction process.
