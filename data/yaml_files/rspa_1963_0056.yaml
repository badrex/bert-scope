tldr: This study investigates the propagation of finite elastic waves in rubber filaments
  during retraction and extension. The research focuses on natural rubber and a hysteretic
  synthetic rubber (butyl rubber) and provides a quantitative interpretation of the
  observed phenomena based on the measured force-extension relation of the materials.
  The findings reveal different patterns of behavior, including the passage of an
  unloading wave without dispersion in natural rubber and dispersion in butyl rubber.
  The study also explains the observed phenomena using the appropriate stress-strain-time
  relations of the materials.
