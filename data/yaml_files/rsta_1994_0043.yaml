tldr: The solid state dehydration of lithium potassium tartrate monohydrate is completed
  in two rate processes. The first reaction is deceleratory and controlled by diffusive
  water loss, while the second reaction is a nucleation and growth process. A kinetic
  and mechanistic study has been undertaken to understand the dehydration mechanism,
  including electron microscopic examinations of the cleaved surfaces of partly reacted
  crystals. The findings provide insight into the structure of the dehydration interface
  and the mechanism of water release.
