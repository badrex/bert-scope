tldr: This article examines the Carboniferous sedimentary basins of northern Europe
  and the mechanisms behind their formation. It explores the hierarchical nature of
  crustal changes and the role of lineaments and flexures in the development of these
  basins. The study also highlights the similarities between upper crustal mechanics
  and soft-rock mechanics in coal mining, suggesting that both may be products of
  the same underlying mechanism.
