tldr: The experiments conducted by Abbe Nolet and communicated by J. T. Desaguliers
  demonstrate the effect of different salts and temperatures on ice. They found that
  certain salts, such as sea salt and potash, can increase the cold of ice, which
  has implications for testing gunpowder and making ice cream. The authors also suggest
  using spirit of wine and ammonium salt to increase the cold of ice in the absence
  of ice itself.
