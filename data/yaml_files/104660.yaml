tldr: Euler discusses the contraction of planetary orbits and the possible shortening
  of the Earth's days. He raises questions about the accuracy of ancient observations
  and the invariability of gravity, and suggests that the Earth's rotation around
  its axis may be becoming more rapid due to the influence of Jupiter.
