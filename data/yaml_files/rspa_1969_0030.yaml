tldr: The authors investigated the effects of X-rays on undoped and hydrogen-doped
  alkaline earth fluorides using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) methods. They
  found that X-ray irradiation at low temperatures produces centers and trapped electron
  centers in undoped and hydrogen-doped crystals. The rate of generation of electron
  centers in hydrogen-doped crystals is greater than in undoped crystals. The study
  provides insights into the production of defects in alkaline earth fluorides and
  the behavior of trapped electron centers.
