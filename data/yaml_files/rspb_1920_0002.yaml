tldr: The author examines the vegetative morphology of Pistia and the Lemnaceae, comparing
  their structures and providing insights into the nature of their fronds and buds.
  The study reveals that the distal part of the Lemnaceae frond is a petiolar phyllode,
  similar to Pistia, and that the bud-containing pockets in Pistia are equivalent
  to the pockets of the Lemnaceae. This research contributes to a better understanding
  of the relationship between Pistia and the Lemnaceae.
