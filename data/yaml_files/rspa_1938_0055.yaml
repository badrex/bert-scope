tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the motion of a fluid heated from
  below. They observed the onset of convection and the change in heat transfer as
  the temperature difference between the plates increased. The results showed that
  the critical temperature difference at which the fluid began to move decreased with
  an increase in the distance between the plates. The authors also used an optical
  method to measure the temperature gradients in the moving fluid, providing further
  insight into the behavior of the heated fluid layer.
