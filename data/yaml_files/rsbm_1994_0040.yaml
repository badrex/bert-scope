tldr: The article is a biographical memoir of Peter Dennis Mitchell, a biochemist
  who developed a theory of energy transduction in biological systems. Mitchell's
  work transformed the field of bioenergetics and had widespread ramifications in
  cell biology. His research focused on understanding the properties of biological
  membranes and the mechanisms of energy transfer, leading to the discovery of chemiosmosis
  and the role of ATP synthase in energy production.
