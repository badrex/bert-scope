tldr: Researchers discovered that synthetic membrane filters, devoid of any added
  lipid or protein, exhibit current fluctuations similar to those observed in biological
  ion channels. These filters show rapid transitions between high-conducting and low-conducting
  states, ion selectivity, and inhibition by divalent cations and protons. These findings
  suggest that ion conductance at the interface may play a significant role in ion
  channel function.
