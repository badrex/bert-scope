tldr: The author examines the mechanism by which the Lacerta Gecko and house-fly are
  able to adhere to various surfaces, including ceilings and smooth walls, in opposition
  to gravity. They discover that both animals use a combination of specialized feet
  and vacua to create adhesion, with the Gecko's feet having unique cavities and the
  fly's feet having concave surfaces. This research provides insight into the evolutionary
  adaptations of these animals and their ability to navigate diverse environments.
