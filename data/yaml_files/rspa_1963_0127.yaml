tldr: This study examines the damage caused by fission fragments in various heat-sensitive
  crystals. The authors observe different types of tracks in crystals like silver
  cyanamide, silver thiocyanate, and mercury thiocyanate. They propose a thermal mechanism
  for the damage, attributing differences in the amount of damage to variations in
  the range of electrons in different materials. The observed damage is not enough
  to cause an explosion, supporting the conclusion that fission fragments would not
  induce an explosion in a heat-sensitive material.
