tldr: The article discusses the cognitive mechanisms involved in recognizing familiar
  faces. It proposes that familiar face recognition involves a fixed sequence of stages,
  including structural encoding, accessing long-standing visual representations, retrieving
  semantic information, and finally, retrieving the name. The article also examines
  factors that affect the ease of familiar face recognition, such as repetition priming,
  distinctiveness effects, and associative priming.
