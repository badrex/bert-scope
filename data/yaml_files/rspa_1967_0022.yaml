tldr: This article discusses the early history of the Moon and explores the possibility
  of its dynamical capture by the Earth. The authors investigate the process of capture
  through various mechanisms, including changes in solar eccentricity and lunar distances
  due to meteoritic bombardment. They also examine the role of tidal friction in altering
  the Moon's orbit and the importance of considering the angular momentum of incoming
  and outgoing meteoritic material.
