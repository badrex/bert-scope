tldr: The authors studied the effects of Leishmania infantum infection in hamsters,
  observing peculiar localized lesions in the animals. They found that the parasites
  primarily affected the joints, testes, and lymphatic glands, with minimal enlargement
  of the spleen. The study also revealed differences in the course of infection between
  the Chinese and Tunisian strains of Leishmania, suggesting they may be distinct
  varieties or species.
