tldr: The author conducted experiments with metal wires falling in glycerine solutions
  to study the drag of cylinders in fluids at slow speeds. They discovered that the
  resistance experienced by the cylinders is influenced by the distance of the fluid
  boundaries, and that Lamb's formula for drag is only applicable in an infinite or
  nearly infinite fluid. The experiments showed the existence of a purely viscous
  regime where fluid inertia can be neglected, and the resistance coefficient increases
  threefold as the distance to the boundaries increases.
