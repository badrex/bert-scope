tldr: The author, William Nicholson, describes an instrument that can produce the
  two states of electricity without friction or communication with the Earth. The
  instrument consists of two fixed plates, a revolving plate, and a ball. By rotating
  the plate, the instrument can generate and manipulate electricity, leading to increased
  intensities and even sparking. This discovery has implications for the study of
  electricity and could be useful in multiplying and manipulating electricities in
  the future.
