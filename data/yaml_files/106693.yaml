tldr: The author, Edward Waring, explores the resolution of attractive forces acting
  on a point and the attraction of surfaces and solids on a given point. He develops
  methods to calculate the force resulting from multiple forces acting on a point
  and applies these methods to problems involving lines, surfaces, and solids. This
  work contributes to the understanding of attraction laws and the mathematical foundations
  of mechanics.
