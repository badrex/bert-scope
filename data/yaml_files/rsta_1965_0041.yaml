tldr: This article discusses the possibility of thermal convection in the Earth's
  mantle, which is believed to be non-Newtonian and crystalline. The author proposes
  that convection in the mantle can take place with plausible values of the dimensions
  of the hot column and the yield stress, coinciding with the stress drop estimated
  from the energy release in deep focus earthquakes. This convection can explain the
  oceanic ridges, the direction of intersecting Murray-Menard wrench faults, and the
  relative incompressibility of continents. The author also estimates the velocity
  of the westward drift of the Americas and the plasticization and fluxing of the
  crust, which may be the consequence of the precipitation of water from serpentine
  flowing continentward from the oceanic ridge.
