tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the change in the area and catalytic
  activity of metallic surfaces when transitioning from the solid to the liquid state.
  They found that the accessible area of the surface remains constant, while the total
  catalytic activity depends on three factors. The study also showed a decrease in
  specific catalytic activity when a metal passes from the solid to the liquid state.
