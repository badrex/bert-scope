tldr: The author investigates the climbing organ of the insect Rhodnius prolixus,
  which is absent in nymphs but present in adults. The organ allows the adult insect
  to climb smooth surfaces, such as glass, by using a tibial pad. The author also
  discusses the possibility of an oily secretion being involved in the organ's function
  and suggests that it may serve as a sexual clasping organ during copulation.
