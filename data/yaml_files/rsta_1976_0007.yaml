tldr: This article discusses the palaeomagnetic evidence for the existence of a Proterozoic
  super-continent, which was made up of the majority of the Earth's ancient shields.
  The author analyzes apparent polar wander paths from various continents and finds
  that they align with each other, suggesting that these landmasses were once part
  of a single super-continent.
