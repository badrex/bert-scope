  Survey'

tldr: The authors conducted a geochemical survey of ultramafic xenoliths from various
  locations, finding regional differences in upper mantle material that can be explained
  by partial fusion and extraction of the liquid phase. They also discuss the relevance
  of chemical models for understanding the composition of the upper mantle and its
  implications for petrology and geophysics.
