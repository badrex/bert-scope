tldr: The authors investigate the oscillation spectra of ultra compact stars, focusing
  on polar and axial modes. They find that the characteristic frequencies of these
  modes approach each other as the star becomes more compact, and that both modes
  are essentially spacetime modes. This study helps to understand the origin of various
  oscillation modes of relativistic stars.
