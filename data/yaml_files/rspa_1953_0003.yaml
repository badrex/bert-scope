tldr: This study investigates the oxidation kinetics of benzaldehyde in benzene solution,
  focusing on the mechanism of peroxide formation and the effect of impurities. The
  authors found that the reaction is sensitive to the presence of catalysts and inhibitors,
  and they developed a purification method to obtain consistent oxidation rates. The
  results provide insights into the chain mechanisms involved in the oxidation process
  and the role of different chain carriers.
