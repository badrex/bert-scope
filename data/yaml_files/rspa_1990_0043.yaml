tldr: The author presents an analytical solution for the factorization of compound
  rotations using a calculus of rotation axes and quaternion variables. The solution
  is applied to the problem of orienting an object using rotation axes determined
  by stereochemical considerations, and it can be used to determine the rotation produced
  by given shaft setting angles.
