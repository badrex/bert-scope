tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the reaction between formaldehyde and proteins,
  discovering that the presence of salts can inhibit the formation of complex polymers.
  They also investigated the nature of globulins, explaining their solubility in certain
  salt solutions and their insolubility in water. This research provides insights
  into the chemical character of proteins and their interactions with salts.
