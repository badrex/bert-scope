tldr: The authors used radioactive thorium-B vapour to study the transport of gases
  to and from grass and grass-like surfaces in a wind tunnel. They found that the
  resistance to gas transport depends on the surface's geometry and wind speed, and
  that the eddy diffusivities of heat and gas in the boundary layer are nearly equal.
  This research provides insights into the complex processes of gas transport over
  natural surfaces.
