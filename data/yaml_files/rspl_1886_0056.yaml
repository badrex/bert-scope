tldr: This article presents a study on the thermal properties of ethyl oxide and the
  phenomenon of "transfer-resistance" in electrolytic and voltaic cells. The author,
  William Ramsay, and Sydney Young, discovered that transfer-resistance varies inversely
  with atomic weights of the electrolyte and is related to surface tension. They also
  studied the expansion of the liquid, pressure of the vapor, and compressibility
  of the substance in gaseous and liquid conditions, deducing the densities of the
  saturated vapor and the heats of vaporization for ethyl oxide.
