tldr: This article discusses the use of numerical models to understand the budgets
  of atmospheric trace gases, focusing on the global sources and sinks of radiatively
  active gases like methane. The authors present a two-dimensional model and a three-dimensional
  model to study the behavior of these gases, considering emissions, transport, and
  chemical transformations. The models help to calculate the budgets of these gases
  and provide insights into their role in climate change.
