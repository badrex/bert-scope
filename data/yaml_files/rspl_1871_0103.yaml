tldr: The article presents a study on the effects of various chemical compounds on
  vibrio-life. It classifies these compounds into six categories based on their actions
  on the vibrios, such as injurious, neutral, or promoting their growth and putrefaction.
  The findings provide insights into the role of these compounds in the life cycle
  of vibrios and their potential applications in controlling putrefaction.
