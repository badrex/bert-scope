tldr: The study examines the properties of the series elastic component in muscle
  contraction, which acts as a buffer and accumulates mechanical energy as tension
  rises. This component plays a crucial role in producing final velocities in movements
  like jumping and throwing. The research uses dynamic methods to analyze the tension
  and length relationship in actively contracting muscles, finding that a significant
  fraction of the mechanical energy is stored as elastic energy in tendons and recording
  systems.
