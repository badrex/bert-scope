tldr: The author, William Wales, explores the use of tables of natural and logarithmic
  sines, tangents, and secants in resolving affected equations. He demonstrates a
  new method for resolving equations, which can be applied to various fields such
  as geometry, astronomy, and optics. This method offers advantages over traditional
  algebraic methods, making it easier and faster to find the value of unknown quantities
  in equations.
