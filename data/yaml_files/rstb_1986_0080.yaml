tldr: The article discusses the importance of modeling biological invasions, considering
  factors such as chance, explanation, and prediction. It explores various models,
  including stochastic and deterministic approaches, to understand the spread and
  persistence of species in ecosystems. The author emphasizes the need for clear and
  robust models that can be applied to real-world situations and help in understanding
  the complex dynamics of biological invasions.
