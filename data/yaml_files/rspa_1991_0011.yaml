tldr: The author investigates the thermal conductivity of composite materials made
  of periodic arrays of spheres with some lattice sites unoccupied. They develop a
  method to account for multiparticle interactions and determine the effective conductivity
  for various ratios of particle diameter to lattice size. The study provides estimates
  of the effective conductivity for a wide range of parameters, complementing percolation
  calculations.
