tldr: In this letter, Henry Miles shares his observations of a very cold day in June
  and a very hot day in July 1749. He also discusses the agreement of thermometers
  in London and Tooting. Miles and his friend John Canton made similar observations
  and compared their findings, concluding that the temperature difference between
  the two places is imperceptible to the senses.
