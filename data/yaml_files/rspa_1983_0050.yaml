tldr: This article investigates the impact of meteorological phenomena on the Earth's
  rotation, focusing on fluctuations in the total angular momentum of the atmosphere.
  The authors demonstrate that changes in length-of-day and polar motion can be attributed
  to atmospheric contributions, providing a theoretical basis for future research
  in meteorology and geophysics.
