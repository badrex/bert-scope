tldr: The study investigates the effects of ultra-violet rays on skeletal muscle,
  specifically the frog's sartorius muscle. It shows that the muscle contracts remarkably
  when exposed to ultra-violet rays, and the contracture is dependent on the presence
  of calcium ions in the nutritive solution. The muscle's excitability does not recover
  after the irradiation, and the contracture is likely due to a kind of "rigor mortis."
  The study also highlights the importance of calcium ions in the process.
