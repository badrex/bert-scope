tldr: The author conducted experiments on the nerve roots of Macacus rhesus to understand
  their formation and function in the lumbo-sacral plexus. They found that each bundle
  of nerve fibers in a nerve root represents a single simple movement and remains
  distinct in its course to the muscles it supplies. The author also discovered that
  the group of muscles supplied by any given nerve root can have both flexion and
  extension movements, and that these movements alternate in consecutive nerve roots.
  The results of dividing nerve roots showed that the amount of paresis or paralysis
  produced is proportional to the number of roots divided and that no incoordination
  is produced in the remaining muscular combinations.
