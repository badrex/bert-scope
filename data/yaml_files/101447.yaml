tldr: The article describes the process of saltpetre production in the Mogol's dominions,
  as reported by Monsieur Thevenot. Saltpetre is extracted from three types of earth
  - black, yellow, and white, with the best quality coming from black earth. The process
  involves creating pits, filling them with earth, treading it to reduce its consistency,
  and then allowing it to crystallize into saltpetre. The final product is boiled
  and purified before being dried in the sun.
