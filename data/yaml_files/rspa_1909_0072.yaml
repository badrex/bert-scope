tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments to analyze the spectrum of radium
  emanation. They used various methods, including prism spectrographs and grating
  spectrographs, to measure the wave-lengths of the emanation lines. The results were
  compared with previous studies, and the authors provided a detailed method for calculating
  the wave-lengths of the lines in the spectrum. The accuracy of the results is estimated
  to be around 0.5 Angstrom units in the middle of the spectrum.
