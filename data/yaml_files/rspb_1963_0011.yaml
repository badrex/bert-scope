tldr: This article discusses the primary photoprocesses of chlorophyll and related
  molecules in photosynthesis. It explains how light absorption by photosynthetic
  pigments in plants is converted into chemical energy, which is represented by NADPH2
  and ATP, and accompanied by the liberation of oxygen. The article also covers the
  physical processes that follow light absorption by a polyatomic molecule in solution,
  focusing on chlorophyll a, and the role of solvent molecules in affecting the photoprocesses.
