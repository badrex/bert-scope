tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption spectra of five amino compounds,
  including glycine, diketopiperazine, tetramethyl-diketopiperazine, glycyl-glycine,
  and urea. They found that resonance between the C-N and bonds takes place in all
  the substances, confirming the zwitterion form in glycine and glycyl-glycine crystals.
  The results also showed that both diketopiperazine and tetramethyl-diketopiperazine
  possess a center of symmetry.
