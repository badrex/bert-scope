tldr: The author observed blood, plant sap, and the structure of sugar and salt under
  a microscope. They discovered that blood consists of small globules, and plant sap
  contains tiny particles and pipes that may be responsible for their taste. The author
  also explains the difference in taste between salt and sugar, suggesting that the
  shape and size of their particles affect the taste sensation.
