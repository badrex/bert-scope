tldr: This article discusses the repulsion and rotation produced by alternating electric
  currents. The author explains the phenomena of repulsion and rotation using the
  concepts of self-induction and phase lag in secondary currents. The experiments
  conducted by Professor Elihu Thomson are analyzed, and the author calculates the
  force and couple intensities in various cases. The article also debunks the misconception
  that a copper plate acts as a screen and causes unsymmetrical fields.
