tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the number of electrostatic units
  in the electromagnetic unit of electricity. They used a modified version of Maxwell's
  method to measure the capacity of a condenser and found that the time constant of
  the system was very small compared to the time during which the plates of the condenser
  were connected. This allowed them to calculate the electromagnetic measure of the
  capacity of the condenser and compare it with the electrostatic measure.
