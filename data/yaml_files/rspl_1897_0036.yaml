tldr: This article presents a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium,
  focusing on the relations with material media. The author introduces the concept
  of aether as the seat of the elastic transmission of electric and magnetic forces
  and discusses the interactions between different portions of matter. The theory
  provides a more precise understanding of electric currents, moving material media,
  and electric radiation.
