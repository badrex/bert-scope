tldr: The authors studied the gas phase electron resonance spectra of diatomic hydrides,
  specifically OH and OD, to analyze hyperfine and quadrupole interactions. They determined
  the magnetic hyperfine and electric quadrupole parameters and compared them with
  various molecular wavefunctions. This research provides detailed information about
  the molecular wavefunction and is important for understanding the structure and
  properties of diatomic molecules.
