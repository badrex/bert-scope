tldr: This study investigates the role of antiserum in tissue transplantation immunity.
  The authors found that high doses of antiserum can prolong the survival of skin
  homografts, but have no effect on the rejection of freshly transplanted skin homografts.
  Antiserum does not affect the sensitivity of mice that have already been sensitized.
  The authors propose that antiserum may act by a central inhibition of the sensitization
  process.
