tldr: This article discusses the distribution of flora and fauna in the southern cold
  temperature zones, focusing on the effects of continental drift and the significance
  of understanding the origins of plant and animal distributions. The authors explore
  various aspects of the topic, including the role of seed dispersal, the importance
  of taxonomic research, and the impact of Pleistocene coolings on plant distributions.
