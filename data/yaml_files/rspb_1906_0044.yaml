tldr: The authors studied the first maiotic division in various animals and plants,
  focusing on the forms assumed by the gemini (heterotype chromosomes). They discovered
  that six constant forms of gemini co-exist in every instance of the first maiotic
  division, and these forms are present before the spindle fibers have acted on them.
  This finding challenges existing conceptions about the nature of gemini forms and
  raises questions about the wider implications of these findings.
