tldr: The 1961 eruption of Tristan da Cunha's volcano caused significant damage to
  the island's vegetation due to toxic fumes, lava flows, ash, and fires. The study
  examines the extent of the damage and the recovery process of the affected plants.
  The primary factors determining the area of fume-damaged vegetation were the nature
  and volume of toxic gases released by the volcano, the direction of the prevailing
  wind, and the sensitivity of the dominant plants to the fumes.
