tldr: Lord Rayleigh's experiments and theories on capillary phenomena of jets explore
  the behavior of fluids as they flow through orifices of various shapes. He discovered
  that the wave-length of the figure formed by the jet is directly proportional to
  the velocity of the fluid, and that the elongation of the wave-length increases
  with the pressure. This research contributes to the understanding of fluid dynamics
  and the behavior of jets.
