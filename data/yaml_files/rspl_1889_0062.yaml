tldr: This study investigates the arrangement of excitable fibers in the internal
  capsule of bonnet monkeys (Macacus sinicus) to understand the relationship between
  the fibers and the basal ganglia. The authors expose the internal capsule through
  a horizontal section and use a minimal stimulus to record the movements. They find
  that the movements are arranged in the same way as observed in the cortex, with
  the representation of extension situated in front of flexion for the upper limb
  segments and toes.
