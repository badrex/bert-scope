tldr: The authors analyzed the band spectra of alkaline earth halides, focusing on
  the fluorides of calcium, strontium, and barium. They used quantum analysis to classify
  the band systems and study their gross structure, finding that these molecules have
  great vibrational stability and often exhibit long sequences in their spectra. The
  authors also discussed the molecular emitters and the vibrational effect in these
  molecules.
