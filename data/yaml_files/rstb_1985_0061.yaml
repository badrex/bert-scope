tldr: This study investigates the effects of opioid peptide agonists selective for
  different receptors on identified dorsal horn neurons and their role in nociception.
  The intrathecal infusion of these agonists reduces behavioral responses to noxious
  thermal stimuli. The dynorphin, a selective ligand for the K receptor, and other
  opioid receptor-selective compounds were tested on single identified dorsal horn
  neurons. The results suggest that the K receptor is involved in the selective antinociceptive
  effect of dynorphin on ascending somatosensory neurons. The effect of dynorphin
  was antagonized by naloxone and RX 781094, suggesting a novel mechanism for the
  mediation of segmental antinociceptive effects through activation of the terminals
  of descending tracts.
