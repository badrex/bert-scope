tldr: The authors studied the effects of isotope substitution and thermal expansion
  in furoic acid crystals. They found that substituting deuterium for hydrogen in
  the crystals led to an expansion along the direction of the hydrogen bonds. The
  thermal expansion, however, was found to be largely determined by van der Waals
  forces between the dimers and had no direct relation to the isotope expansion. This
  research confirmed that short hydrogen bonds, even in isolated pairs, show the usual
  isotope effects, but they do not control the thermal expansion.
