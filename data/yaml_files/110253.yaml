tldr: The author describes a new device for measuring tides and wind direction. The
  device uses a long sheet of paper with parallel lines representing feet in height,
  wound around a cylinder. A clock and a weather vane record hourly wind direction
  and tide levels, tracing lines on the paper. The author also discusses potential
  applications for tide prediction and the creation of accurate tide tables.
