tldr: The authors investigated the relationship between the morphology of nerve terminals
  and cutaneous sensibility in the human body. They found that there are only two
  types of nerve endings in the skin, and that the commonly recognized'modalities'
  of sensation cannot be associated with specific types of nerve endings. The results
  suggest that there may be a simple, consistent, and non-specific plan of construction
  underlying the diverse morphology of nerve endings in the skin.
