tldr: In 1761, Charles Morton and William Magee observed the transit of Venus over
  the Sun from Calcutta, Bengal. They recorded the event using a stopwatch and compared
  it with a meridian line to determine the accuracy of their timekeeping. The observations
  provided valuable data for understanding the solar system and the behavior of Venus.
