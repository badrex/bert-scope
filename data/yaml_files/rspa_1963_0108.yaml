tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the interfacial free energy of copper-antimony
  alloys and their surface composition. They found that antimony lowers the surface
  energy and causes embrittlement of copper at low temperatures. The creep behavior
  of the alloys was also investigated, revealing that the creep rate increases with
  increased antimony content.
