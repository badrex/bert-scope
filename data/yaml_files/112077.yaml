tldr: This study examines the spectra of nebulae and fixed stars, concluding that
  many nebulae are massive luminous gases rather than clusters of distant stars. The
  author uses a prism to analyze the light from various nebulae, discovering that
  their spectra consist of three distinct lines. This research challenges the idea
  that all nebulae are clusters of stars and suggests that they are composed of luminous
  gas or vapor.
