tldr: This lecture discusses the chemistry of nucleotides, focusing on the synthesis
  and structure of nucleic acids and nucleotide coenzymes. The author describes various
  methods for synthesizing nucleotides, including the use of dibenzyl phosphorochloridate
  as a phosphorylating agent. The lecture also covers the synthesis of adenosine triphosphate
  (ATP) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP), and explains the structures of ribonucleic
  and deoxyribonucleic acids as 3'-linked polymers.
