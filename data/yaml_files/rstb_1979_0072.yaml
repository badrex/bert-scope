tldr: The article discusses the development and performance of a forecasting service
  for infestations of the African armyworm, Spodoptera exempta, in East Africa. The
  service uses nightly moth catches, meteorological information, and reports of larvae
  to provide weekly forecast probabilities of larvae damaging cereal crops and grazing.
  The forecasting service has been successful in helping farmers organize control
  measures in time and improve the accuracy of the forecasting service.
