tldr: Arthur Stewart Eve was a pioneering scientist in the field of radioactivity
  and geophysics. He worked closely with Ernest Rutherford and made significant contributions
  to the understanding of radiation, including the discovery of secondary and beta-rays
  from primary alpha-rays, the measurement of radium in rocks and sea-water, and the
  determination of radioactive material in the atmosphere. His work on cosmic rays
  and their effects on ionization in the air helped shape the understanding of these
  phenomena in the early 20th century.
