tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of retinal-image movements
  on vision. They found that step-movements and pulse-movements have different impacts
  on visual perception. For step-movements, the target remains in a new position,
  while for pulse-movements, the target is displaced for a short time and then returns
  to its original position. The study helps to understand the importance of eye movements
  for normal vision and how they affect the perception of visual stimuli.
