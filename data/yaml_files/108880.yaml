tldr: This article presents algebraic research on Newton's Rule for finding imaginary
  roots in algebraic equations, specifically focusing on equations up to the fifth
  degree. The author, J.J. Sylvester, provides a demonstration of the rule's validity
  and discusses the application of invariant criteria to determine the character of
  the roots in these equations.
