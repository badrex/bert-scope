tldr: In this article, Robert Boyle presents several experiments and discoveries related
  to the nature of light and fire. He explores the subtilty, efficacy, and determinate
  nature of effluviums, and conducts experiments to make the parts of fire and flame
  stable and ponderable. Additionally, he investigates the perviousness of glass to
  ponderable parts of flame and discusses the implications of his findings for natural
  philosophy, chemistry, and other fields.
