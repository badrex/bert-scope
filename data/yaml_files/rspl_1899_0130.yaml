tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of extremely low temperatures,
  specifically the temperature of liquid hydrogen, on bacterial vitality. They found
  that exposing bacteria to a temperature of about -252°C for ten hours had no appreciable
  effect on their vitality. This research contributes to the understanding of life
  under extreme conditions and has implications for the study of bacterial survival
  in cold environments.
