tldr: The author integrates the boundary-layer equations using an asymptotic solution
  containing an unknown parameter. The method of steepest descent is applied to evaluate
  integrals, and Euler's transformation is used to sum divergent expressions. The
  results are applied to Blasius and Falkner-Skan equations, and the general boundary-layer
  equation for flow past an elliptic cylinder, showing close agreement with experimental
  data.
