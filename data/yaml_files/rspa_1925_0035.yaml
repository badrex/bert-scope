tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the vibrations and sounds produced
  by airscrews. The authors investigate the frequencies of the sounds due to flexural
  vibrations and rotation, and they use a hot-wire microphone and four-valve amplifier
  to measure these frequencies. They also analyze the resonance curves of the airscrews
  and discuss the possible types of vibrations, including those of the blades and
  shaft. The study contributes to the understanding of airscrew design and noise reduction
  in aviation.
