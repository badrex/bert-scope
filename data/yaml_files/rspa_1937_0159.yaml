tldr: The authors propose the cyclol hypothesis, which suggests that proteins have
  a folded structure. They explore the implications of this hypothesis and discuss
  the topological and metrical conditions required for space-enclosing cyclols. The
  study provides insights into protein chemistry and the potential role of topology
  in the future of macromolecular research.
