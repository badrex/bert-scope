tldr: The author studied the distribution and behavior of osteoclasts in the parietal
  bones of normal growing mice using supravital staining with neutral-red. They found
  that the staining reaction varied between individual cells and provided insights
  into the origin and fate of osteoclasts. The author also compared the distribution
  of osteoclasts in normal and mutant mice, such as grey-lethal and hydrocephalus-3,
  and observed differences in their number and size. This research contributes to
  our understanding of bone growth and development.
