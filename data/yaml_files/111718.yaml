tldr: This article discusses the discrepancy between the astronomical and geodetic
  amplitudes of the Indian Arc. The author concludes that the difference can be explained
  by a slight but widespread variation in the Earth's crust density, which causes
  deflections in the vertical line and affects the measurements. This discovery is
  important for understanding the accuracy of geographical maps and the need to consider
  local factors when measuring distances and positions.
