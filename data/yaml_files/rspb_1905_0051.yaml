tldr: The authors conducted experiments to find a therapeutical agent for treating
  trypanosomiasis in animals. They found that arsenic and trypan red were the most
  effective drugs. Atoxyl, a compound of arsenic and aniline, showed promising results
  in treating trypanosomiasis. The treatment was effective in reducing the number
  of parasites in the blood and improving the general condition of the animals. The
  authors also discussed the use of trypan red in combination with atoxyl and its
  potential benefits in treating human trypanosomiasis.
