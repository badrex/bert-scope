tldr: 'This study examines thorium haloes in biotite using a halo photometer, providing
  measurements of ring diameters and intensity of blackening throughout the halo.
  The research classifies thorium haloes into three stages of development: embryonic,
  normal, and over-exposed. The distribution curve of ring radii shows eight well-defined
  groups, with five ascribable to the thorium family, two to members of the uranium
  family present in compound haloes, and one of unknown origin. The study finds good
  agreement between the mean group radii and accepted alpha-particle ranges.'
