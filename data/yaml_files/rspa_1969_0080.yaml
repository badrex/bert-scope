tldr: The author investigates the fluid dynamics of a rotating disk thrust into an
  interface supporting an insoluble, viscous surface film. They develop a theory of
  absolute surface shear viscosity, taking into account the hydrodynamic coupling
  between the internal viscosity of the substrate and the surface viscosity of the
  adsorbed surface film. The study provides a better understanding of the flow patterns
  near the rim of the disk and helps improve the interpretation of surface viscometry
  experiments.
