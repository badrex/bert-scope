tldr: Dr. Arthur Bury explains the use of sea-sand and lime as fertilizers in Devonshire.
  Sea-salt and lime, when mixed together, improve soil fertility and produce rich
  pastures for grazing sheep year-round. Bury suggests that every gentleman should
  learn this method to enrich their country and themselves. Glauber's method of creating
  a compost mix using quicklime, salt, and water is also discussed.
