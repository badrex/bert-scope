tldr: A child was born with an extraordinary tumour near the anus, containing rudiments
  of an embryo. The tumour was examined and found to have cartilaginous joints resembling
  a sheep's tail and an embryo-like structure with a brain, cerebellum, mouth, and
  ear. The child eventually died due to the tumour and its complications.
