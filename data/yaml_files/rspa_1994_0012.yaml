tldr: The authors derive doubly uniform approximations for the remainder in the optimally
  truncated saddle-point expansion for integrals containing a large parameter. They
  unite two types of asymptotic singularities in a common framework, incorporating
  the Stokes error function and canonical catastrophe integrals. This study provides
  a better understanding of the appearance of subdominant exponentials and the coalescence
  of exponential contributions as parameters vary.
