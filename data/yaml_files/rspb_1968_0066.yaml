tldr: The authors investigated the electrochemistry of cochlear endolymph in rats,
  focusing on its electrical potential and ionic composition. They discovered that
  the endolymph's high potassium and low sodium concentrations are maintained by an
  active transport mechanism, which is dependent on oxidative metabolism. This study
  provides insights into the physiological mechanisms of the hearing process and may
  help understand disorders like Meniere's disease.
