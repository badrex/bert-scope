  Effects'

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frog and mammalian muscles to study the
  effects of heat-contraction and temperature on muscle length. They discovered that
  heat-contraction is caused by the heat-coagulation of different proteins in the
  muscle tissue. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of muscle contraction
  and the role of proteins in the process.
