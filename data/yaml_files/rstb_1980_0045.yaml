tldr: This article discusses the biochemical and genetical approaches to understanding
  the mechanism of action of penicillin. It explains how penicillin inhibits the transpeptidation
  reaction in peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to bacterial cell wall disruption and
  ultimately killing the bacteria. The article also highlights the identification
  of three penicillin-binding proteins as the primary targets for penicillin in Escherichia
  coli and the use of genetic mutants to study the consequences of inactivating these
  proteins.
