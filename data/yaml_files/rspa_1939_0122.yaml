tldr: This article investigates the production of cosmic ray showers by penetrating
  cosmic rays. The knock-on theory, which suggests that a mesotron knocks an electron
  in a direct collision, is found to be capable of accounting for the observed showers.
  The probabilities for other possible shower production processes are also analyzed.
