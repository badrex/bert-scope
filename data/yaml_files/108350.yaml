tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the relationship between the
  intensity of the electric current and the physiological effects it produces when
  transmitted through a nerve. They discovered that the contraction of a muscle is
  proportional to the amount of electricity passed through it, and that the limited
  current can be determined by the depth of a column of water in the circuit. This
  research helps to further our understanding of electro-physiology and the underlying
  mechanisms of muscle contraction.
