tldr: The authors use X-ray analysis to study the structure of quartz and its transformation
  at 575Â°C. They discover that the hexagonal form of quartz has a simpler structure,
  which helps in determining the positions of atoms in the trigonal form. The study
  also examines the physical properties of quartz, such as its expansion coefficient,
  rotatory power, and refractive index, which change suddenly at the critical temperature.
