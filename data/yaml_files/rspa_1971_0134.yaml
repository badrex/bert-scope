tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study superelastic collisions between slow
  electrons and excited mercury atoms. They measured the corresponding cross-sections
  and found that the concentration of excited atoms is nearly independent of pressure,
  while the concentration of ground state atoms rises with pressure. The superelastic
  cross-section in the pressure range of 20-40 mTorr for electron energies of 1-5
  eV was found to decrease with increasing pressure, showing branches corresponding
  to the fine structure of the excited state. The authors also obtained approximate
  values for the momentum transfer cross-section for electrons in mercury by measuring
  the current of elastically scattered electrons as a function of energy.
