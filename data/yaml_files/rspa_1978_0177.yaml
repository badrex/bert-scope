tldr: The authors study the space of asymptotically shear-free cuts of an asymptotically
  flat space-time, known as H-space, and explore its connection with twistor theory.
  They find that H-space is a 4-dimensional complex manifold with a complex Riemannian
  metric and demonstrate that its curvature is always self-dual. This research provides
  an alternative approach to understanding the asymptotic structure of space-time
  and has implications for the study of gravitational radiation and the geometry of
  space-time.
