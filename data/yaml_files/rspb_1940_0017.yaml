tldr: The author investigates the hardening mechanism of the ootheca of the cockroach
  Blatta orientalis. They find that the ootheca is mainly composed of a protein, likely
  keratin, with a well-developed system of primary valence cross-linkages responsible
  for its resistance to enzymes and chemical reagents. The ootheca hardens due to
  the oxidation of an ortho-dihydroxyphenol, and its secretion is derived from the
  colleterial glands of the female cockroach.
