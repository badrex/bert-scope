tldr: The authors conducted experiments on pea-root tips to study the effects of oxygen-lack
  and cyanide on mitosis. They discovered that mitosis is arrested in the absence
  of oxygen or in the presence of cyanide. This finding challenges previous generalizations
  that mitosis can proceed without oxygen once it has begun. The results suggest that
  all stages of cell division depend on the presence of oxygen.
