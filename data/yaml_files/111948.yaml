tldr: The authors conducted experiments with hydriodic acid and mannite, a six-atomic
  alcohol. They discovered that when heated together, iodine is released and a heavy
  oily liquid distills. The reaction produces iodide of hexyl, which is further analyzed
  and confirmed to be hexylic alcohol. This research contributes to the understanding
  of the hexyl group of compounds.
