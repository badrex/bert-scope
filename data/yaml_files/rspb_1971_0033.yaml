tldr: This article discusses the biological effects of pollution in the sea, specifically
  the influence of pesticides on marine ecosystems and estuarine fauna. The author
  highlights the importance of understanding the toxicity of pesticides to estuarine
  animals and the potential consequences of long-term exposure to sublethal amounts
  of pesticides. The article also describes a bioassay program that evaluates the
  toxicity of pesticides to estuarine fauna and the development of techniques for
  assessing pesticide pollution in estuaries on a national scale.
