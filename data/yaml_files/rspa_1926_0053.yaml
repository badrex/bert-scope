tldr: This paper explores the motion of two spheres in a viscous fluid and compares
  the results to Bohr's quantized orbits. The authors use Stokes' stream-function
  to calculate the forces necessary to maintain the spheres' motion and find that
  the analysis is applicable to a similar problem where the spheres are fixed and
  the fluid streams past them. The study suggests that the principles of fluid dynamics
  can be related to the quantum mechanics of atomic orbits.
