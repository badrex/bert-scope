tldr: This article investigates the phenomenon of creep buckling in structures, focusing
  on the influence of post-buckling characteristics. It examines the behavior of structural
  models with one or two degrees of freedom and explores the relationship between
  creep buckling and the structure's behavior without creep. The study considers different
  material behaviors, including viscoelastic models that allow for limited and unlimited
  increases in creep strain.
