tldr: The author discusses the classification of fossil animals commonly known as
  dinosaurs, focusing on the ilium morphology and vertebrae structure. They propose
  two types of iliac bones for classification purposes and analyze the differences
  in pelvic construction and pneumatic condition of vertebrae among various dinosaur
  groups. The author suggests that these differences can help distinguish between
  dinosaur orders and sub-orders.
