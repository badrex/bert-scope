revised_title: Analyzing the Internal Structure of Charged Spherical Black Holes

tldr: The authors study the internal structure of charged spherical black holes, focusing
  on the mass-inflation phenomenon at the Cauchy horizon. They find that an approximate
  analytic solution exists, allowing the mass-inflation singularity at the Cauchy
  horizon to exist, and they provide evidence that the Cauchy horizon is not preceded
  by a spacelike singularity.
