tldr: The study investigates the feeding behavior of the piper Hyporhamphus ihi, focusing
  on their nocturnal feeding habits and the role of the lateral line system. Field
  studies show that piper feed primarily on demersal zooplankton at night, while during
  the day they consume copepods and terrestrial insects trapped on the water surface.
  Laboratory experiments confirm that piper can locate and consume prey in total darkness,
  supporting the hypothesis that they use their anterior lateral line to feed on zooplankton.
