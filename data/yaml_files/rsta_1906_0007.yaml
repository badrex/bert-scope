tldr: This article investigates the optical properties of metal glasses, colloidal
  solutions, and metallic films by analyzing their microstructures and calculating
  their optical constants. The author discusses the effects of different microstructures,
  such as amorphous, granular, and spicular, on the colors and properties of these
  materials. The study provides a foundation for understanding the behavior of metals
  in various forms and applications.
