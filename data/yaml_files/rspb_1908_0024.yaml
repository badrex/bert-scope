tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the physiological effects of calcium
  and magnesium in the animal body. They found that calcium neutralizes the inhibitory
  effects of magnesium, demonstrating an antagonistic relationship between the two
  elements. This finding has implications for understanding the functioning of both
  animals and plants.
