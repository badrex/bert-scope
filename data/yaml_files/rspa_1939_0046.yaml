tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the absorption of neutrons in various
  elements using radioactive isotopes. They found that the absorption cross-section
  for different elements increased with atomic weight, but there were significant
  fluctuations in the results. The authors discussed possible reasons for these deviations
  and compared their findings with theoretical predictions.
