tldr: The authors study the development of teeth in Elasmobranch Fishes and Teleostei,
  focusing on the unique process of tooth formation in these species. They describe
  the stages of dental development, the role of enamel-organ, and the differences
  in tooth formation between these fish groups and mammals. The research provides
  valuable insights into the evolution of teeth and dental development in vertebrates.
