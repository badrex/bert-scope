tldr: This article investigates the electrical breakdown of rod/rod, rod/sphere, and
  rod/plane gaps in the atmosphere using impulse potentials. The study examines the
  breakdown process, time-lag characteristics, and the influence of various factors
  such as electrode geometry and impulse voltage wavefront. The findings reveal that
  the breakdown voltage of a rod/rod gap depends on the wavefront of the impulse,
  and the breakdown process can be better understood by considering the electric field
  distortion due to space charge.
