tldr: The authors conducted experiments to examine the carcinogenic properties of
  various tetracyclic and pentacyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. They found that 3:4-benzphenanthrene
  had pronounced carcinogenic activity, while other compounds showed varying levels
  of activity or none at all. The results suggest that the ring system of 1:2-benzanthracene
  is responsible for the cancer-producing properties and that certain substitutions
  in the molecule can enhance or inhibit this activity.
