tldr: The article discusses the Antarctic Expedition led by Sir James Clark Ross,
  which aimed to map the magnetic elements in the southern hemisphere. Edward Sabine
  describes the magnetic survey conducted by Lieutenant Henry Clerk, who used a magnetic
  observatory at the Cape of Good Hope to gather data. The survey aimed to complete
  the mapping of high latitudes and understand the influence of a ship's iron on magnetic
  instruments. The findings of this survey would help improve the accuracy of compass
  readings and contribute to the understanding of terrestrial magnetism.
