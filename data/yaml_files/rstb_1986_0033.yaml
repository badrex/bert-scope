tldr: This article explores the genetic basis of plant form and architecture, focusing
  on the role of meristems in plant development and the impact of genetic changes
  on plant morphology. The author discusses the differences between discrete and continuous
  morphological changes and the importance of understanding these differences for
  plant breeding and adaptation to environmental conditions.
