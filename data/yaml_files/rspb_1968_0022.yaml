tldr: The authors discovered that neurophysin, a protein associated with oxytocin
  and vasopressin hormones, exists in multiple subtypes. They isolated and studied
  two main neurophysin subtypes, neurophysin-I and neurophysin-II, which have different
  properties and electrophoretic mobilities. The researchers found that these subtypes
  are present in neurosecretory granules in the pituitary gland and that their complexity
  is due to proteolytic degradation during extraction processes.
