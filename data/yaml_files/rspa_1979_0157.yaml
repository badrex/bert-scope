tldr: The article discusses the isoparametric transformation method, which is used
  to approximate complex geometries in finite element methods. It focuses on the Steiner
  surface, a simple non-trivial case of piecewise rational surface approximations,
  and provides examples of its occurrence and some of its properties.
