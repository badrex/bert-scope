  Increasing Ambient Temperature'

tldr: This study investigates the effects of increasing ambient temperature on exothermic
  reactions, considering factors such as heat loss, heat generation, and reactant
  consumption. The authors provide a mathematical model for spatially uniform reactions
  and determine the conditions for thermal ignition when the ambient temperature increases
  linearly over time. The findings can be applied to understanding and interpreting
  experimental measurements of ignition temperatures in various chemical processes.
