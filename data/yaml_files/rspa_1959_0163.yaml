tldr: The author investigates the stress distribution in materials with rigid inclusions,
  such as crystals, and its implications for geological processes like metamorphism.
  The study shows that stress differences are mainly determined by the greatest principal
  stress, and suggests that stress may not be the primary factor in crystal formation,
  but rather the rotation of crystals in the surrounding rock during flow.
