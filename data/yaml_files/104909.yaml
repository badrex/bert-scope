tldr: In 1753, George William Richman, a professor of experimental philosophy, was
  tragically killed by a thunderstorm while conducting an experiment on electricity.
  Richman was studying the electrical power of thunderclouds and had set up a system
  to collect and measure the electricity. During a powerful thunderstorm, a lightning
  strike hit Richman's house, causing a massive electrical discharge that killed him
  instantly. This event highlights the dangers of electricity and the power of natural
  phenomena.
