tldr: This article discusses the enhanced nuclear acoustic resonance in insulating
  crystals, focusing on the theoretical considerations and matrix elements of the
  spin-strain Hamiltonian. The authors derive the spin-strain Hamiltonian for crystals
  of tetragonal symmetry and explain the mechanisms of energy transfer from paramagnetic
  impurities to the thermal bath. The article also explores the hierarchy of acoustic
  interactions with a spin system and the differences between non-Kramers and Kramers
  systems.
