tldr: The authors describe the determination of the framework structure of zeolite
  beta, a high-silica zeolite with a complex stacking disorder. They used high-resolution
  electron microscopy, electron diffraction, computer-assisted modeling, and powder
  X-ray diffraction to analyze the structure. Zeolite beta can be regarded as a highly
  intergrown hybrid of two distinct structures with 12-ring pore systems. The authors
  also discuss the synthesis, sorption properties, and ion-exchange characteristics
  of zeolite beta, highlighting its potential applications in various hydrocarbon
  conversion processes and as a sorbent.
