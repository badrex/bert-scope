tldr: The author examines the development of Echinus esculentus by studying its larvae.
  They describe the formation of various organs and structures, such as the coelom,
  hydrocoele, madreporic vesicle, and oral disc, as well as the transformation of
  the larva into the adult form. The study provides insights into the developmental
  stages and processes of echinoderms.
