tldr: Dr. Schwediawer presents an account of Ambergrise, a solid, opaque, and inflammable
  substance found near the sea or in the bowels of whales. Ambergrise has a peculiar
  smell and is used in various industries. The author discusses the origin and nature
  of Ambergrise, examining its properties and possible origins, such as being an animal
  production or excrement of the whale. The author also investigates the relationship
  between Ambergrise and the spermaceti whale, which is believed to be the source
  of the substance.
