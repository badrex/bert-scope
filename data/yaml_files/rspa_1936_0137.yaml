tldr: This article describes a method to significantly increase the intensity of polarized
  X-ray beams, allowing for their use in experimental studies of vectorial phenomena
  in the interaction of X-rays and matter. The author discusses the challenges of
  producing, detecting, and using polarized X-rays, and presents a solution using
  a single crystal surface as a scatterer, which provides a one-thousandfold increase
  in intensity.
