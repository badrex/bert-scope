tldr: This study investigates the sperm precedence pattern in harlequin beetle-riding
  pseudoscorpions when females mate with multiple males. The researchers found that
  last-male sperm precedence breaks down when females mate with three males, unlike
  in two-male mating experiments. This suggests that the opportunity for post-copulatory
  sexual selection may be greater in nature than previously thought. The findings
  have implications for understanding the impact of female promiscuity on sexual selection
  and reproductive success in natural populations.
