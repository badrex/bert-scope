tldr: This article discusses the constancy of sensitivity of a photocell during a
  specific period, from 1930 to 1934. The author examines the effects of changes in
  the opal-flashed diffusing glass and anode potential on the photocell's sensitivity.
  The results show that there was no significant decrease in sensitivity during this
  time, and the photocell maintained consistent performance.
