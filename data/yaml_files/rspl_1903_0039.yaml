tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the oxidizing action of rays from
  radium bromide on the decomposition of iodoform. They discovered that the rays from
  radium can cause the oxidation process, which requires the presence of oxygen and
  light. The authors also found that the radium rays are different from the active
  rays of light and that the most active rays are the beta rays, which are a stream
  of negative electrons. The results of these experiments have implications for understanding
  the physiological effects of radium rays and the potential role of pigmentation
  in protecting against their lethal effects.
