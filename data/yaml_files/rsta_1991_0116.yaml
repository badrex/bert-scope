tldr: This article provides an overview of chemical instabilities, oscillations, and
  traveling waves in various systems. It discusses the role of nonlinearity and feedback
  in these phenomena and highlights recent research in gas-phase reactions, gas-solid
  interactions, and enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The authors emphasize the importance
  of understanding these responses in chemical science and their potential applications
  in other systems.
