tldr: The article discusses the discovery of prostacyclin, a substance produced by
  the vessel wall that acts as a potent vasodilator and inhibitor of platelet aggregation.
  It explains how prostacyclin is synthesized from arachidonic acid and its role in
  regulating platelet-vessel wall interactions. The article also explores the potential
  therapeutic uses of prostacyclin in treating conditions related to increased platelet
  aggregation and prostacyclin deficiency.
