tldr: This study uses random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) markers to assess male
  mating success in the compound ascidian Diplosoma listerianum. The research investigates
  the blockage of sperm movement in the oviduct, which prevents cross-fertilization
  in certain clones. The findings suggest that a somatic-gametic incompatibility mechanism
  regulates mating in D. listerianum, possibly involving the differential phagocytic
  removal of sperm sharing self-recognition markers with maternal tissue.
