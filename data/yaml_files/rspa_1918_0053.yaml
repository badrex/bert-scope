tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the spectrum of cadmium in various
  inert gases, such as helium, neon, argon, and xenon. They observed that the intensity
  and visibility of cadmium lines varied significantly depending on the gas type and
  pressure. The study provides insights into the behavior of metal spectra in different
  gas environments.
