tldr: A lady born blind received sight at an advanced age due to the formation of
  an artificial pupil. The author performed three operations to remove a portion of
  the closed iris, which successfully imparted vision. The lady could distinguish
  colors, forms, and relative situations in angular positions, and was profoundly
  affected by the grand features of nature.
