tldr: This article discusses the cultural evidence and its chronological context to
  imply behavioral patterning and identify possible causes of change in the transition
  from Middle to Upper Palaeolithic technology. It examines the spread of modern humans
  and the disappearance of archaic hominid populations, focusing on African and Asian
  perspectives. The article highlights the importance of improved dating methods,
  firmly dated fossil hominids, and new regional localities for a better understanding
  of the origin and spread of the modern genepool.
