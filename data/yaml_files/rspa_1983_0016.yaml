tldr: This article explores the evolution of temperature profiles in systems capable
  of reacting exothermically and potentially exploding, focusing on distributed temperatures
  and heat conduction. The authors provide analytical solutions for temperature histories
  in subcritical, critical, and supercritical circumstances, with a particular emphasis
  on marginally supercritical cases. The results have a simple and readily computable
  form for various geometries and rate laws, making the calculations easily extendable
  to further scenarios.
