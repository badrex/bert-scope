tldr: This article presents a summary of papers read to the Royal Society of London
  on February 8, 1900. The papers cover topics such as the spectrum of a star, electric
  touch, molecular changes due to electric waves, and electrification effects of sodium
  in air and other gases. The research on sodium electrification was suggested by
  Professor J. J. Thomson and aimed to determine if evaporation of an unelectrified
  liquid produces any electrification.
