tldr: The authors investigated the hydration of cations in polystyrene sulphonates
  using an isopiestic method. They obtained adsorption isotherms and calculated the
  heats and entropies of hydration for various monovalent and divalent cations. The
  results showed that the hydration water associated with cations varies with water
  activity and temperature, and the amount of hydration water is not related to the
  co-ordination number of the ions.
