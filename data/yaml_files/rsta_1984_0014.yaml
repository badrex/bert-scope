tldr: This article investigates the petrogenesis of Andean volcanic rocks, focusing
  on the relative contributions of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental crust to
  magma formation. The authors analyze the chemical and isotopic characteristics of
  volcanic rocks from different zones of the Andes, concluding that the complex process
  of magma formation involves source composition, fractional crystallization, and
  crustal contamination during the ascent through the continental crust.
