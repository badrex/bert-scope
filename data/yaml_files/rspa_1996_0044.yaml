tldr: This study investigates the fuel-type characterization of carbonaceous fly-ash
  particles using energy-dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) surface chemistries. The technique
  is applied to particles extracted from lake sediments, providing information on
  potential sources of associated airborne pollutants and aiding in indirect dating
  of sediment cores. The method can be used in various environments and has potential
  applications in Britain, Europe, and globally.
