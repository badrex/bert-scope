tldr: This study investigates the vertical migration of Daphnia magna in a laboratory
  setting using a tank filled with a suspension of indian ink in tap water. The results
  show that light is the primary factor influencing the animals' movements, and they
  undergo a complete cycle of vertical migration when an overhead light source is
  cyclically varied in intensity. The study provides insights into the physiological
  mechanisms underlying diurnal migration and the role of light in these movements.
