tldr: The study investigates the ultrastructure and function of antennal sensilla
  in Acetes shrimps. It describes the morphology of the antenna and the ultrastructure
  of five types of antennal setae. The authors discuss the setal function and arrangement
  in relation to the behavior and ecology of sergestids. The study provides insights
  into the sensory capabilities of a planktonic animal.
