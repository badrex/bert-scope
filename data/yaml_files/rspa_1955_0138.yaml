tldr: 'The authors measured the isothermal Joule-Thomson coefficient of four binary
  gas mixtures: carbon dioxide-nitrous oxide, carbon dioxide-ethylene, nitrous oxide-ethylene,
  and nitrous oxide-nitrogen. They compared these measurements with a statistical
  theory of mixed gases composed of non-spherical molecules and found that the change
  of the zero-pressure coefficient with composition in the binary mixtures agrees
  better with the calculated values for mixtures of non-spherical molecules than those
  for mixtures of spherical molecules.'
