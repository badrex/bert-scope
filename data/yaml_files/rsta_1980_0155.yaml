tldr: This study analyzes data from the selective chopper radiometer on the Nimbus
  5 satellite to understand the temperature structure of the middle atmosphere. Spectral
  analysis reveals the structure of large-scale planetary waves and their differences
  between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The research also identifies westward-traveling
  wave 1 components with periods of 5.8, 8.3, and 12.3 days.
