tldr: The article discusses the potential applications of chaos theory in psychology,
  particularly in understanding the dynamics of the human brain and the disorder schizophrenia.
  It suggests that the limbic brain, responsible for emotions and moods, can be modeled
  using high-dimensional dynamical systems, and that schizophrenia may be explained
  by chaotic oscillations in the limbic brain. This theory could provide a simple
  explanation for the disorder's complex and diverse symptoms.
