tldr: This article investigates the relationship between pathogenic viruses and their
  host cells. The authors propose that viruses are obligatory parasites that multiply
  either in or on living cells. They use photodynamic inactivation to study the behavior
  of viruses in infected animals and determine the time of their entry into susceptible
  cells. The results show that the protection afforded by living cells to different
  viruses varies in degree and that viruses need a certain amount of time to penetrate
  the host cells.
