tldr: The authors studied the cells of the islets of Langerhans and found that their
  secretory activity is associated with changes in the form and size of the Golgi
  apparatus. They observed that during pregnancy and after exposure to heat, the islet
  cells show more uniform activity and distinct morphological changes. The authors
  suggest that the secretory products are formed within the Golgi apparatus and then
  discharged into the cytoplasm of the cell.
