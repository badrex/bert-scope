tldr: This paper explores the application of the Theory of Local Probability to random
  straight lines. The author demonstrates how this theory can be used to solve various
  problems related to probability and provides several integrals of a singular character.
  The paper also discusses the extension of these results to the cases of lines and
  planes taken at random in space.
