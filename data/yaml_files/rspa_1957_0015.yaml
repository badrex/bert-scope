tldr: This study examines the mild wear process in tool steels by rubbing two hardened
  high-speed tool steel surfaces against each other. The research team used various
  surface examination techniques, including radioactive tracers, optical microscopy,
  and electron microscopy, to understand the wear mechanism. They discovered that
  the main cause of wear in mild conditions is abrasion by loose wear particles, and
  the wear rate increases as the scale of the wear process decreases.
