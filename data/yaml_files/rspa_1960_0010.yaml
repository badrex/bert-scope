tldr: The authors study the acoustic radiation from a turbulent fluid containing foreign
  bodies, focusing on the pressure fluctuations and their sources. They use Green
  functions to solve the inhomogeneous scalar wave equation for density fluctuations
  and derive relationships between radiated pressure and fluctuations on the surface.
  The analysis is useful for understanding the interaction between the fluid and the
  boundaries, as well as the scattering of radiation from the sources.
