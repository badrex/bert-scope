tldr: The authors explore cylindrical wave solutions in general relativity, demonstrating
  that these waves can propagate energy. They also study the interior and exterior
  field of a static cylinder of approximately constant density and discuss the energy
  transfer by pulse waves. This research contributes to the understanding of gravitational
  waves and their effects on matter distribution.
