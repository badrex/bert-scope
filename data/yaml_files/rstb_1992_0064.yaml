tldr: The article investigates the processing of complex sounds by the auditory system,
  focusing on sensory transduction and frequency selectivity in the basal turn of
  the guinea-pig cochlea. It compares outer hair cell (OHC) and inner hair cell (IHC)
  receptor potentials, finding that IHC receptor potentials are maximized to ensure
  a voltage response to high-frequency tones, while OHC receptor potentials are minimized
  for sensitive transduction. The study concludes that OHCs generate feedback that
  enhances IHC responses only at the best frequency, providing insight into the cochlea's
  frequency tuning and sensitivity.
