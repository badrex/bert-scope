tldr: This study examines the olfactory responses of Drosophila melanogaster larvae
  to a series of primary alcohols and identifies genetic and developmental factors
  influencing these responses. The research finds that larvae show varying responses
  to different alcohols, with some attracting and others repelling them. The authors
  also discover three new mutant strains with abnormal olfactory responses. These
  findings contribute to the understanding of olfaction in Drosophila larvae and its
  genetic basis.
