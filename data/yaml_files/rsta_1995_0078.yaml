tldr: The article investigates the nonlinear effects in boundary-layer transition,
  focusing on solitary-like waves in boundary-layer flows and their randomization.
  The authors analyze the forced Korteweg-de Vries equation and study the wave generation
  process, discovering two bifurcations that lead to erratic elements in fluid motion.
  The research provides insights into the mechanisms behind the onset of random elements
  in fluid motion before laminar-turbulent transition.
