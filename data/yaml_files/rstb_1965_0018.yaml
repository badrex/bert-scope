tldr: The study investigates the dual control of hormone synthesis and release in
  the pituitary gland of the dogfish Scylliorhinus stellaris. It examines the morphology
  and ultrastructure of the neuro-intermediate lobe, revealing that neurosecretory
  fibers innervate the intrinsic secretory cells, suggesting a dual control mechanism
  involving both type A and type B neurosecretory fibers.
