tldr: The author presents a comprehensive theory of glacial motion, discussing the
  sliding of ice masses, internal pressures and tensions in glaciers, and the role
  of regelation in maintaining the continuity of ice structures. The study aims to
  provide a more complete and systematic understanding of glacial motion and its related
  phenomena.
