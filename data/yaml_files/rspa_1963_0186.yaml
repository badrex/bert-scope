revised_title: Kinetics of the Reaction of Hydrogen Atoms with Molecular Oxygen
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Chemical kinetics
semantic_tags:
- Chemical kinetics
- Hydrogen-oxygen reaction
- Atomic oxygen
- Hydroxyl radicals
- Reaction rates
tldr: The authors studied the reaction between hydrogen atoms and molecular oxygen,
  discovering that the rate-determining step is a third-order reaction. They also
  found that atomic oxygen and hydroxyl radicals are produced in the process, and
  determined the rate constant for the reaction. This research provides valuable insights
  into the kinetics of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction and its related processes.
