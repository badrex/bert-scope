tldr: The author applies wave mechanics to a complicated collision problem, demonstrating
  how the correct result arises naturally from the consideration of waves alone. This
  study aims to gain a clearer understanding of the relationship between particle-like
  and wave-like properties of matter, and to explore the potential of the quantum
  theory in explaining various physical phenomena.
