tldr: The authors developed a semi-automatic apparatus for measuring specific heats
  and used it to study the specific heat of sodium between 55 and 315 K. The apparatus
  uses continuous heat input and maintains adiabatic conditions automatically. The
  specific heat measurements were found to be accurate within 0.1%, with a small anomaly
  observed in the region of 200 K.
