tldr: The article describes the British submarine gravity surveys conducted in 1938
  and 1946, focusing on the exploration of the continental shelf and seafloor topography.
  The surveys used specialized equipment, including echo sounders and pendulum apparatus,
  to gather valuable data on the Earth's gravitational field and the complex underwater
  landscape. These surveys provided important insights into the geophysics of the
  ocean floor and contributed to the understanding of the Earth's structure and dynamics.
