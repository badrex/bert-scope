tldr: The authors investigated the metal content in coal, focusing on the metal complexes
  associated with the organic structure of coal. They used solvent extraction with
  organic solvents to analyze the metal content and discovered the presence of metalloporphyrins,
  which are thought to be derived from the chlorophylls and haems of the biological
  precursors of coal. This research has implications for coal liquefaction processes
  and the search for alternative sources of products previously derived from crude
  oil.
