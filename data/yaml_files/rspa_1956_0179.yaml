tldr: 'The authors studied the oxidation of acetaldehyde in glacial acetic acid, catalyzed
  by manganese, copper, and cobalt acetate. They found that the reaction proceeds
  in two stages: the oxidation of the aldehyde to peracetic acid and the reaction
  of peracetic acid with acetaldehyde to form a second peroxide. The metal-salt-catalyzed
  decomposition of both peroxides was determined. The results indicate that the initiating
  process is an electron-transfer reaction between the aldehyde and the higher valence
  state of the metal catalyst, leading to a chain process and a unified reaction scheme
  for the metal-salt-catalyzed oxidation of acetaldehyde.'
