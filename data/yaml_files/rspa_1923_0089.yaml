tldr: This article investigates the spectrum of ammonia and its emission bands, specifically
  the Schuster bands, the "a-band," and the ultra-violet band. The study examines
  the bands in various conditions, such as in vacuum tubes and ammonia-oxygen flames,
  and discusses their possible origins and the role of nitrogen and hydrogen in their
  formation. The findings suggest that the Schuster bands represent the true spectrum
  of ammonia, while the other bands are due to different stages of ammonia molecule
  dissociation.
