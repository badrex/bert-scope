tldr: The authors conducted precise measurements of the energies of beta-rays from
  radium B and C using a magnetic spectrograph. They found that their values agreed
  closely with those of Rogers for the lines measured by him. The energies were calculated
  using weighted mean values of e/m and c, and the error in the energies was approximately
  1 part in 10^3. This research helped improve the accuracy of determining nuclear
  levels and energy differences in radium isotopes.
