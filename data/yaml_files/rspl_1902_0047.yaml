tldr: The authors studied the correlation between barometric heights at various stations
  on the eastern side of the Atlantic Ocean. They discovered that the correlation
  between stations varies in summer and winter months and that there is a zone of
  positive correlation followed by a zone of negative correlation. The authors also
  found that the barometric height at a station is more closely related to stations
  in the southern hemisphere than to those closer by.
