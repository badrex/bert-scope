tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of using submarine cables as electromagnetic
  oceanographic flowmeters. The authors develop a numerical model to calculate the
  response of submarine cables to different sea flow velocities and explore the effects
  of seasonally varying sea conductivity and tidal range on the cable's sensitivity.
  The study aims to provide a method for modeling and evaluating the reliability of
  submarine cables as flowmetering devices in various oceanographic situations.
