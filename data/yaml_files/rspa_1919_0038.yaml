tldr: The author analyzes the observed errors of the Moon's longitude and argues that
  the secular acceleration cannot be determined until the nature and quantity of the
  periodicity of the errors are determined. The author also criticizes previous work
  that attempted to explain the errors as being due to incorrect long-period terms,
  stating that there is substantial agreement among theoretical and numerical work
  that these errors cannot be explained in that way.
