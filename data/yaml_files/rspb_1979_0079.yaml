tldr: The author discusses the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations
  and challenges the idea that heterozygous advantage is the primary factor. Instead,
  the author proposes that frequency-dependent selection, where predators, parasites,
  and competitors favor rare phenotypes, can explain the maintenance of genetic variation
  and continuous variation in both molecular and morphological characters.
