tldr: This article introduces new numerical invariants called secondary torsions,
  which, along with Betti numbers and coefficients of torsion, help characterize the
  homotopy type of a certain class of polyhedra. These invariants are also applied
  to classify continuous mappings of an n-dimensional polyhedron into an n-sphere.
  The study provides a new approach to understanding the topology of polyhedra and
  their mappings.
