tldr: The article discusses the microbial membrane transport system in Escherichia
  coli, specifically focusing on fructose transport. The author explains the role
  of HPr and FPr proteins in the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase
  (PT) system, which is responsible for the uptake and phosphorylation of fructose.
  The study also highlights the differences between the fructose enzyme II and other
  enzymes II in the PT-system, emphasizing the uniqueness of the fructose transport
  system in E. coli.
