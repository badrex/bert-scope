tldr: This study investigates the time relations of tendon reflexes in humans, focusing
  on the knee-jerk reflex. The authors found that the magnitude of the response is
  directly related to the strength of the stimulus, and the latent period decreases
  with increased cortical activity. They also discovered that the refractory period
  of the reflex is influenced by the effectiveness of the stimulus, and the knee-jerk
  reflex appears to be an "all-or-none" reflex based on the participation of neurones.
