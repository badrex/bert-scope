tldr: The authors redetermined and refined the crystal structures of a-D-glucosamine
  hydrochloride and hydrobromide using modern computing methods. They found that the
  inter-ionic hydrogen bonding, dominated by the coordination around the NH3 groups
  and anions, plays a significant role in the structure. This study confirmed the
  original solution to the crystal structure and provided insights into the hydrogen
  bonding and molecular packing of these compounds.
