tldr: The authors develop a Green function method to study electronic surface states
  and interfaces. They clarify the foundations of the method and provide a general
  formalism for obtaining the desired information, such as the density of states and
  wavefunction matching at the interface. The method can be applied to various physical
  situations and does not require assumptions about the abrupt termination of potentials
  at a geometrical plane.
