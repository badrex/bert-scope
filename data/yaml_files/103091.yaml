tldr: The author observed mold growth on a melon and discovered that it propagates
  rapidly through spores. He found that the mold growth could be compared to a type
  of bullrush plant. The mold eventually led to the putrefaction of the melon, which
  produced maggots that later turned into flies. This observation highlights the connection
  between vegetable life and fermentation, as well as animal life and putrefaction.
