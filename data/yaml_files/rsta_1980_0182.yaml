- Cosmology

- Redshift
tldr: The authors analyze the spatial distribution and evolution of active galaxies,
  such as quasars and radio galaxies, using the luminosity-volume test and the Hubble
  diagram. They find evidence for the cosmological evolution of active galaxies and
  discuss the implications of their findings for the luminosity function and the nature
  of the universe.
