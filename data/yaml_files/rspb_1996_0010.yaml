tldr: Researchers developed a method to create large and representative cDNA libraries
  from a small number of identified leech neurons using polymerase chain reaction-based
  technology. The libraries contain a high proportion of cDNAs larger than 500 base
  pairs and are free from contaminating rRNA or PCR artifacts. This is the first report
  of constructing cDNA libraries from identified neurons, providing a valuable resource
  for studying gene expression in the nervous system.
