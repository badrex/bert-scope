tldr: The author presents a numerical disproof of a conjecture in projective geometry
  by using modern computers and integer arithmetic. They provide two counterexamples
  that disprove the conjecture for any number of lines greater than six. The method
  involves calculating line coordinates and determining the intersection of lines,
  verifying theorems, and checking the accuracy of calculations.
