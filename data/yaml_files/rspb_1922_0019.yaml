tldr: The author examines the development and morphology of palm leaves, focusing
  on the unique structure and growth patterns of these plants. They propose a new
  theory for the development of palm leaves, suggesting that the plications originate
  by invagination, or differential growth, rather than folding or splitting of tissues.
  This theory challenges previous interpretations of palm leaf development and provides
  a new understanding of the complex structure of these plants.
