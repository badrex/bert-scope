tldr: This article discusses the motion of fluid elements and small spherical and
  non-spherical particles in non-uniform flows. It explores the differences in their
  responses and how these particles are influenced by factors such as inertia, gravitational
  settling, and the surrounding fluid's properties. The study focuses on laminar flows
  and highlights the complexity of particle motion compared to the simple motion of
  fluid elements.
