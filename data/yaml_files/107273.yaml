tldr: This article discusses the effect of westerly winds on the water level of the
  British Channel and the resulting currents. The author, James Rennell, explains
  how these currents can impact the navigation of ships in the area, particularly
  during storms. He also describes the differences in current direction and strength
  on either side of the Strait of Dover and how this influences the overall water
  flow.
