tldr: This article presents the results of a series of measurements of photochemical
  action made during the total solar eclipse of December 22, 1870. The authors aimed
  to determine the relationship between photochemical action and changes in the sun's
  exposed area. They found that the chemical intensity of total daylight follows a
  straight-line relationship with the sun's altitude. The authors also compared their
  findings with previous observations made in Moita, near Lisbon, and discussed the
  variation of direct and diffused radiation during the eclipse.
