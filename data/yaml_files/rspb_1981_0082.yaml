tldr: The authors investigate how intracellular geometry affects auxin transport in
  plants, specifically in shoots. They propose a mechanism by which statolith movement
  influences auxin transport, leading to a downward diversion of auxin when a plant
  is tilted. This mechanism explains the geotropism observed in plants, where shoots
  bend to maintain their original growth direction when tilted. The study provides
  insights into the cellular processes involved in plant growth and response to gravity.
