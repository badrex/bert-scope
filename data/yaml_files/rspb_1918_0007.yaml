tldr: The author investigates the formation of nitrites from nitrates in aqueous solutions
  through sunlight exposure and the assimilation of these nitrites by green leaves.
  They discover that sunlight can convert nitrates into nitrites, and green leaves
  can absorb these nitrites in the presence of sunlight. This process is essential
  for the growth and sustenance of plants.
