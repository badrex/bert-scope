tldr: The Soviet-American gallium experiment aimed to measure the solar neutrino flux
  using a radiochemical gallium experiment. The experiment began in 1990 and involved
  measuring the number of 71Ge atoms extracted from tons of gallium. The results showed
  a lower solar neutrino flux than predicted by the Standard Solar Model, which may
  indicate the existence of new neutrino properties or deficiencies in the solar model.
