tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure Poisson's ratio, a measure of the
  ratio of transverse strain to axial strain in materials. They used two instruments
  to measure the cross contraction of test pieces while subjected to a longitudinal
  pull. The results showed that Poisson's ratio varied for different materials, such
  as cast iron and copper. This research helped to improve the understanding of material
  properties and their behavior under stress.
