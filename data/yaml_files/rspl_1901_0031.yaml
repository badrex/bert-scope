tldr: The authors investigated the presence of choline in the blood and cerebrospinal
  fluid of patients with various nervous system degenerative diseases, such as General
  Paralysis of the Insane, combined sclerosis, and beri-beri. They found that choline
  could be detected in the blood of these patients using chemical and physiological
  tests. The authors also studied the ionization of cats' sciatic nerves and the behavior
  of positively and negatively charged ions in atmospheric electricity.
