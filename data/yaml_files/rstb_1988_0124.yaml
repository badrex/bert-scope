tldr: This study investigates the Holocene vegetation history at Waun-Fignen-Felen,
  an upland site in South Wales, using pollen analysis and radiocarbon dating. The
  research reveals the development of woodland, heath, and blanket peat over time,
  as well as the impact of human activities on the local vegetation. The findings
  provide insights into the three-dimensional vegetation history and the role of human
  influences on the environment.
