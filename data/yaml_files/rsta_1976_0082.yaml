tldr: This article discusses the nature of volume diffusion during metamorphism and
  examines compositional zoning in metamorphic minerals, specifically focusing on
  garnets. The author presents a theoretical and experimental investigation of diffusion
  in silicates, simplifying the analysis by constructing lattice-fixed reference frames
  to reduce the number of flux equations and diffusion coefficients. The study aims
  to understand the processes of intergranular and volume diffusion in metamorphic
  rocks and their implications on domains of local chemical equilibrium among minerals.
