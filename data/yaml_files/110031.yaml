tldr: The author, John Pond, conducted observations of the star a Lyrae using a mural
  circle instrument to determine its parallax. He found that the parallax of a Lyrae
  did not exceed a small fraction of a second. The author also discussed the effects
  of temperature on the instrument and observations, as well as the limitations of
  the Dublin instrument in determining parallax.
