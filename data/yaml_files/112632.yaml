tldr: The author examines the structure of the optic lobes in cuttlefish, describing
  their composition, layers, and connections. The optic lobes are found to be larger
  than other cerebral masses and have a kidney-like shape. The lobes consist of three
  layers, with the inner layer containing a nuclear network and descending nerve fibers.
  The author also briefly discusses the structure and connections of the remaining
  cerebral ganglia in cuttlefish.
