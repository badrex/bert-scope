tldr: The authors discovered a population of bilaterally distributed cells (CBW cells)
  in the medicinal leech's CNS that are sensitive to water movement. These cells,
  located in each segmental ganglion, respond to water movement on both sides of the
  body and are involved in the leech's ability to orientate and swim towards the source
  of water disturbance. The CBW cells' morphology and physiological properties are
  described, providing insights into their role in water movement detection and sensory
  integration in the leech.
