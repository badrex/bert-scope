tldr: The authors determined the self-diffusion coefficients of sodium and chlorine
  ions in molten sodium chloride using the capillary method with 22Na and 36Cl radio-tracers.
  The results showed that the Nernst-Einstein equation does not accurately represent
  the equivalent conductance of molten salts, suggesting that there are two diffusion
  mechanisms at play. This study provides insights into the structure of molten salts
  and the relations between kinetic properties and the properties of constituent ions.
