tldr: Dr. Beale proposed experiments to study the effects of the Pneumatic Engine's
  exhaust on plants, seeds, and silkworm eggs. He suggested testing whether seeds
  would germinate and plants would grow in an air-exhausted environment. The experiments
  aimed to understand the role of air in plant growth and whether plants live on air
  as much as they do on the earth. A previous experiment showed that lettuce seeds
  grew in open air but not in an air-exhausted environment, highlighting the importance
  of air for plant growth.
