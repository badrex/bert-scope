tldr: The authors study linear adiabatic perturbations of differentially rotating,
  axisymmetric perfect-fluid stellar models. They show that the normal modes are complete,
  meaning any perturbation can be expressed as a superposition of normal modes. The
  analysis provides bounds on the spectrum of normal modes and demonstrates the completeness
  of the normal modes in rotating stars.
