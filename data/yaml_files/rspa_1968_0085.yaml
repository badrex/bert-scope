tldr: The authors numerically investigated the one-dimensional unsteady flow at infinite
  Mach number to understand the role of the blast wave analogy in interpreting experimental
  data on fluid motion past an obstacle at hypersonic speeds. They found that the
  blast wave is the correct limit of the flow, and the integral in question is very
  small, within the anticipated numerical error. However, they also discovered that
  an infinite set of integrals must vanish to prevent a contradiction in the matching
  procedure.
