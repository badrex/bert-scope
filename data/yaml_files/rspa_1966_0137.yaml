tldr: The authors explore the coupling of non-compact group representations, specifically
  focusing on the problem of coupling three'most-degenerate' representations of an
  SL(v, group. They demonstrate that the number of amplitudes to be expected for a
  vertex function based on collinear symmetry is infinite, and further approximations
  must be made to extract meaningful predictions. The study has implications for understanding
  the dynamics of elementary particle multiplets and their interactions.
