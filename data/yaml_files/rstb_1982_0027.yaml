tldr: The article discusses the importance of creating nitrogen cycles in derelict
  land to establish sustainable ecosystems. It explains that derelict land has a low
  nitrogen content, which limits the growth of vegetation. The author suggests that
  nitrogen capital must be built up in the soil through the use of legumes and other
  methods to enable a self-sustaining ecosystem. The study focuses on the reclamation
  of china clay sand spoils, which are an extreme example of nitrogen-deficient material.
