tldr: The author discusses the vital role of the vascular endothelium in controlling
  the blood circulation. The endothelium metabolizes various vasoactive substances,
  converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and secretes potent vasodilators like
  prostacyclin and EDRF (nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1. The
  balance between these mediators determines the cardiovascular system's response
  in diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction. The author
  also highlights the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
  which are valuable drugs for treating hypertension and heart failure.
