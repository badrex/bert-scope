tldr: The author, John Hill, describes the unique properties and uses of Windsor Loam,
  a valuable soil found in Hedgerley. This loam is famous for its ability to withstand
  high temperatures without turning into glass, making it essential for various industries
  like brick-making, iron melting, and glass production. However, the loam is at risk
  of being exhausted, so Hill suggests exploring potential substitutes by analyzing
  its composition and comparing it to other soils.
