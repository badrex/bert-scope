tldr: This article explores the graph-theoretical aspects of simple ring current calculations
  in conjugated systems. It examines the relationship between the adjacency matrix
  of the graph representing the -bond skeleton of a conjugated system and the secular
  equations arising in the theory. The article emphasizes the importance of graph-theoretical
  ideas, such as circuits and spanning trees, in understanding ring currents and highlights
  the significance of determining whether a molecular graph is semi-Hamiltonian or
  non-Hamiltonian.
