tldr: The author observed a remarkable aurora borealis in 1726. The event began as
  a white arch and evolved into a glory with rays extending from east to west. The
  aurora continued for several nights, providing various phenomena for the author
  to study. Despite the aurora, the author was able to observe celestial objects through
  their telescope.
