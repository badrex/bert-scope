tldr: The author, J. Norman Lockyer, conducted spectroscopic observations of the Sun
  and discovered new solar lines in the solar spectrum. These lines were found to
  be coincident with the Fraunhofer lines C and F, and were observed in solar prominences.
  The discovery of these new lines helped to understand the behavior of the solar
  spectrum and the nature of sunspots.
