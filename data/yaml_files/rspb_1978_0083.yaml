tldr: This study examines nuclear DNA variation and chromosome sizes in acridid grasshoppers.
  It found that DNA amount varies threefold among species, and chromosome size is
  closely correlated with nuclear DNA amount. The research also discovered a striking
  uniformity in the relative sizes of chromosomes within complements, despite the
  large-scale variation in DNA amount and chromosome volume. The study suggests that
  the uniformity may be maintained despite disproportionate distribution of DNA changes
  within chromosomes, indicating a possible adaptive importance of a particular distribution
  of chromosome material within complements.
