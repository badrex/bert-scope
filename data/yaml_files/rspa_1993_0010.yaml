tldr: The authors derived rigorous bounds on the complex bulk modulus of isotropic
  viscoelastic two-phase composites using a new variational principle and two established
  techniques, the translation method and the Hashin-Shtrikman method. These bounds
  provide a benchmark for testing experimental results, approximation theories, and
  can help identify optimal structures for use in design. The effective bulk modulus
  is constrained to a lens-shaped region in the complex plane, and the bounds are
  similar to those obtained for the complex dielectric constant but with different
  methods.
