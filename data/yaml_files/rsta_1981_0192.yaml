tldr: This article discusses circulation and fronts in continental shelf seas, focusing
  on the influence of the deep ocean, shelf break, and continental shelf. It highlights
  the importance of wind-driven circulation, density-driven circulation, and the role
  of fronts in cross-frontal mixing. The authors also explore the need for further
  research on the evolution and stability of fronts, the processes of cross-frontal
  and cross-shelf mixing, and the relation of physical processes to the growth of
  phytoplankton in the vicinity of fronts.
