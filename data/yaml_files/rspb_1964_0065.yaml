tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate the essential role of calcium ions in excitation-contraction
  coupling in skeletal muscles. By soaking the muscles in calcium-free solutions,
  the mechanical response to membrane depolarization can be eliminated. The study
  shows that calcium ions play a crucial role in linking electrical events to the
  contractile process within muscle fibers.
