tldr: Gideon Algernon Mantell presents his supplementary observations on the structure
  of the Belemnite and Belemnoteuthis, two genera of fossil Cephalopoda found in the
  Oxford clay of Wiltshire. He provides evidence to support the distinction between
  these two extinct forms of Cephalopoda and describes the various parts of their
  organization, such as the external capsule, osselet, and phragmocone. Mantell also
  discusses the differences between the Belemnite and Belemnoteuthis, as well as the
  soft parts of the animals, which are still unknown.
