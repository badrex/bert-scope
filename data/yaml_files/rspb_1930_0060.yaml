tldr: This study investigates the frozen state in mammalian muscle and the equilibrium
  temperatures at which ice forms. The researchers used dilatometry to measure the
  volume changes in muscle samples from beef, mutton, and pork as they froze and thawed.
  They found that there was very little "bound water" in the muscle, suggesting that
  most of the water in muscle is not tightly bound to the tissue. This finding supports
  recent work by A.V. Hill and contradicts the idea that some water in muscle may
  be present in capillary spaces.
