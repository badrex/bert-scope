tldr: The authors examine the surface forces in fluids and their effects on capillarity.
  They explain how surface layers exert tension or pressure on any material wall and
  how this leads to the phenomena of capillarity. They also discuss the difference
  in density near the surface and the interior of the fluid, and how this affects
  the equilibrium of a fluid in contact with a solid. The authors explore various
  scenarios, including the contact of two fluids, a fluid and its vapor, and a fluid
  and a solid, to demonstrate the surface forces at play.
