tldr: The authors conducted experiments on frog kidneys to study the function of the
  glomerulus and the capacity of tubules to absorb water and solids. They used various
  perfusing fluids and observed the effects on urine production and concentration.
  The results showed that the kidneys could maintain normal histological appearance
  and secrete urine even after complete occlusion of the glomeruli, suggesting that
  the tubules play a crucial role in kidney function.
