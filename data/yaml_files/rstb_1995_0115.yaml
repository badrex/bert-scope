tldr: The article discusses the intracellular membrane morphology and the role of
  vesicle-mediated transport in the exocytic and endocytic pathways. It explains how
  membrane-bound organelles are linked by vesicles that bud from one membrane compartment,
  carry selected cargo, and fuse with the next compartment. The article also explores
  the process of mitotic fragmentation and the role of periplasmic fusion in membrane
  reassembly during mitosis.
