tldr: This article investigates the influence of physical conditions on the velocity
  of decomposition of certain crystalline solids. The authors found that the temperature
  coefficient is a complicated quantity dependent on several factors, and the heat
  of activation cannot be calculated directly. They also discovered a simple relation
  connecting the rate of evolution of oxygen from solid solutions of potassium permanganate
  in potassium perchlorate and the heats of activation of potassium permanganate in
  the various solid solutions.
