tldr: This study investigates the contribution of solar radiation to the thermal environment
  of humans in Antarctica. The authors measured solar radiation, air temperature,
  and wind speed at coastal stations and the South Pole. They calculated the solar
  heat gain on clothing and the body, as well as the cooling power of the environment
  under Antarctic conditions. The results are expressed in terms of a temperature
  increment to be added to the ambient air temperature, providing valuable insights
  into the effects of solar radiation in extreme cold climates.
