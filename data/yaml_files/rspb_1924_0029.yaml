revised_title: Antiseptic Properties of Compounds in the Apocyanine, Carbocyanine,
  and Isocyanine Series

tldr: The authors investigated the antiseptic properties of compounds in the apocyanine,
  carbocyanine, and isocyanine series. They found that xantho-apocyanine compounds
  were more potent antiseptics than erythro-apocyanine compounds. The presence of
  amino groups tended to decrease the antiseptic effect. These compounds were also
  tested on Staphylococcus aureus and B. coli bacteria, showing varying degrees of
  effectiveness depending on the compound and concentration.
