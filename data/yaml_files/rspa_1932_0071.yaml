tldr: This study investigates the mobility of positive alkali ions in argon, neon,
  and helium gases using Kunsman sources. The authors found that the mobility of ions
  in argon closely follows the mass relation, while there is some deviation in neon
  and helium. The results demonstrate the sensitivity of the method in detecting traces
  of heavier alkalies and the profound effect of impurities on ion mobility.
