tldr: The author presents a method to obtain boundary-layer equations in the linear
  theory of thin elastic shells, focusing on the stress equations of equilibrium and
  stress-strain relations. The study aims to satisfy arbitrary edge conditions on
  the shell's boundary while considering the interior problem's major terms. The author
  also discusses the scaling factors for stress components and displacement vectors,
  providing a first approximation to the boundary-layer equations.
