revised_title: FNR's Dual Role in Transcription Regulation

tldr: The study investigates the role of FNR, an iron-binding transcriptional regulator,
  in activating and repressing transcription in vitro. FNR is found to bind to specific
  DNA sequences and can activate or repress transcription at different promoters.
  The findings provide insights into FNR's dual role in regulating gene expression
  under anaerobic conditions in Escherichia coli.
