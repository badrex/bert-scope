tldr: The author, L. H. Walter, developed a method to obtain continuous unidirectional
  currents from a magnetic detector of the self-restoring type. This method uses a
  magnetic mass undergoing reversals of magnetism in the magnetic field of the generator,
  which generates a unidirectional electromotive force (EMF). The generated EMFs are
  equal and opposite, resulting in a continuous unidirectional current during the
  time that oscillations act upon the magnetic mass. This discovery could improve
  telephonic reception and rapid recording work.
