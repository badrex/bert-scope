tldr: The author examines the development of ova and pseudova in insects, focusing
  on Coccus hesperidum, Cynips, and Solenobia. They compare the formation of ova in
  insects generally and conclude that the processes of oogenesis and pseudovogenesis
  are identical. The study provides insights into the reproductive mechanisms of insects
  and contributes to the understanding of their development and anatomy.
