tldr: The authors studied the interaction of protein monolayers with dissolved proteins,
  focusing on fibrinogen, thrombin, and plasma albumin. They found that the increase
  in surface pressure depends on the initial surface pressure of the monolayer and
  the ionic strength of the substrate. No specific interaction was observed between
  fibrinogen and thrombin, suggesting that the specific interaction involves at least
  two groups in each protein held at a critical spacing. The study provides insights
  into protein-protein interactions and their structural changes.
