tldr: This article discusses the complex responses of germ cells to mutagenic agents
  and the challenges in studying germ cells in humans. The author highlights the importance
  of understanding the effects of radiation, chemicals, and other factors on mutation
  rates and their potential impact on genetic diseases. The research focuses on experimental
  work in animals, including the effects of radiation on different germ cell stages
  and the relationship between dose-response and genetic sensitivity.
