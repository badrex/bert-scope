tldr: This article explores the effects of nonlinearities on waves near caustics,
  specifically focusing on dispersive waves. The authors classify caustics into two
  categories (R and S) and provide examples of each in the context of deep water waves
  on currents. They also discuss the role of Airy functions in linear theory and how
  they are replaced by Painleve transcendents in nonlinear cases. The study has implications
  for understanding wave behavior near caustics and the analysis of higher-order ray
  singularities.
