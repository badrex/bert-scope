tldr: The author discovered a new compound formed by reacting cyanogen with anthranilic
  acid. The compound, C10 H10 N2 O2, is difficultly soluble in water but dissolves
  readily in boiling alcohol and ether. The formation of this compound is expressed
  as a reaction involving anthranilic acid, alcohol, and cyanogen. The author also
  studied the reaction of hydrochloric acid on this compound, which leads to decomposition.
