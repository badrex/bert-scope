tldr: The authors study the interaction between kinks and elastic waves in isotropic
  media. They treat a kink as a 'point defect' with a certain mass, constrained to
  move along a line and subject to a radiation reaction. They calculate the rate at
  which an oscillating kink radiates energy into the medium and find that the kink
  has a ring cross-section for elastic waves proportional to the square of its width.
  The kink moving through an isotropic flux of elastic waves experiences a retarding
  force proportional to the product of its velocity and the energy density of the
  waves.
