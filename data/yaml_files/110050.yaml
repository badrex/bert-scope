tldr: Dr. Wollaston found that metallic titanium exhibits a slight magnetic attraction,
  which he initially thought was due to iron contamination. However, upon further
  examination, he discovered that the magnetic power could be attributed to about
  4-th part of iron alloyed with the titanium. This led him to suspect that titanium
  might be contaminated, and he concluded that it should not be classified as a magnetic
  metal.
