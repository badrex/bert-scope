  Laminar Boundary Layers

tldr: The authors extend the method of integral relations to solve three-dimensional
  compressible boundary layer flows with and without separation. They apply the method
  to two incompressible model problems and a supersonic laminar boundary layer flow
  over a swept back wedge, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency compared to finite
  difference methods.
