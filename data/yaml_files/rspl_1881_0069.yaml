tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the inhibitory nerves in the medulla oblongata
  and found that they have an inhibitory influence on the origins of vagus fibers
  that supply the oesophagus, the ends of vagus fibers that control respiration and
  heart movements, and the center in the medulla regulating blood vessels. This research
  shows that inhibitory excitations can extend to neighboring centers, and further
  studies on these inhibitory nerves may lead to interesting discoveries.
