tldr: The study investigates the mass transport velocity in water waves propagating
  over an elastic bed. Analytical solutions for the mass transport velocity inside
  the boundary layer adjacent to the elastic seabed and in the core region of the
  water column are obtained. The mass transport velocity above a soft elastic bed
  could be twice that over a rigid bed in shallow water. The effects of bed deformations
  on the mass transport velocity induced by surface water wave motions are examined.
