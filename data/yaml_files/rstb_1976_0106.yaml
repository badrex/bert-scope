tldr: The article discusses the assembly of tobacco mosaic virus and the role of disk
  aggregates in the process. The virus requires the presence of a specific protein
  aggregate called the disk, which interacts with the RNA to initiate the assembly.
  The disk aggregate acts as a 'jig' and provides a surface for the formation of the
  nucleoprotein helix. The study shows that the presence of disks increases the rate
  of assembly and that they can act as a protein source for the elongation of the
  virus structure. The disk's role in the assembly process is crucial for understanding
  the formation of regular viruses.
