tldr: The author investigates the physiological actions and potential antidotes of
  colubrine and viperine snake venoms. They find that the symptoms produced by these
  venoms are similar to those caused by cobra venom, and that Calmette's antivenin
  may be effective against them. The study also examines the haemolytic action of
  the venoms and their effects on blood pressure and respiratory curves.
