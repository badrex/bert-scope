tldr: The authors analyze the thermal radiation and absorption in the upper atmosphere,
  calculating the rate of absorption of energy and the temperatures at which radiative
  equilibrium is attained. They consider the effects of solar radiation, water vapor,
  ozone, and molecular oxygen on the temperature and absorption rates, providing graphs
  and tables to help understand the complex interactions. This study supports the
  idea that the highest possible daytime equilibrium temperature in the upper atmosphere
  is around 3300K, and the actual temperature can vary depending on the concentrations
  of different gases.
