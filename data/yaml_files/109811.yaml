tldr: The author, Robert Porrett, investigates the nature of salts called triple prussiates
  and the acids formed by combining certain elements with prussic acid. He proposes
  that these salts are binary, consisting of a single base and a complex acid containing
  iron and prussic acid elements. The author also discovers that substances like sulfur
  can form unique acids with prussic acid elements, leading to the creation of Chyazic
  acids. These findings contribute to a better understanding of acid-base chemistry
  and the properties of prussian blue.
