tldr: The article presents a mathematical invariant for the motion of particles, such
  as classical particles, relativistic particles, and photons, when repeatedly reflected
  inside an expanding ellipsoid. The invariant is derived using a specific form of
  the ellipsoid's expansion and is shown to be related to the Hamiltonian of the image
  motion in a transformed reference frame. The findings have implications for understanding
  the behavior of particles in expanding force fields and could be useful in various
  applications, such as in the design of particle accelerators and the study of expanding
  cavities.
