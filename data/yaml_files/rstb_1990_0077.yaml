tldr: This study examines the impact of Iron Age de-settlement in northern Sweden
  on lake acidification. By analyzing pollen and diatom samples from two lakes, researchers
  found that while there was a clear settlement horizon indicating catchment disturbance,
  there was no change in diatom-reconstructed pH after de-settlement. This suggests
  that land-use change alone is not sufficient to cause lake acidification, and that
  atmospheric pollution from fossil-fuel combustion plays a significant role in the
  process.
