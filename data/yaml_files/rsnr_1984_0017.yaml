tldr: The authors discuss the history and sign reversal of the electron-releasing
  effect of the methyl group. They mention that in 1926, the late Professor Sir Christopher
  Ingold reversed the sign convention from -I to +I, as the differential coefficient
  of an increasing quantity is positive. This sign reversal has been generally accepted
  and is used worldwide.
