tldr: The authors find solutions to Einstein's gravitational equations for static
  and rotating systems. They explore the effects of angular velocity and discuss the
  energy tensor, Riemann tensor, and the relationship between the Newtonian potential
  and the distribution of matter. The study illustrates how mechanical properties
  of matter arise from its gravitational field.
