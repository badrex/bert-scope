tldr: The author investigates the center of motion in the human eye and finds that
  it is not in the cornea's axis but in the visual line, approximately one inch behind
  the cornea. The study uses geometrical diagrams, experiments, and anatomical examinations
  of both living and dissected eyes to support the findings.
