tldr: The 1971 Royal Society - Percy Sladen Expedition to the New Hebrides aimed to
  study the flora and fauna of the islands, focusing on their biogeography and the
  ecology of representative plant communities. The expedition explored six major islands
  and collected data on climate, geology, soils, and forest types. The findings provide
  insights into the unique characteristics of the New Hebrides' ecosystems and their
  distinctiveness compared to other island groups in the region.
