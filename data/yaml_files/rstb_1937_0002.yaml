tldr: The author examines the nervous system of the starfish Marthasterias glacialis,
  focusing on the ectoneural and hyponeural systems. They provide a detailed description
  of the various elements of the nervous system, including sensory cells, supporting
  cells, bipolar and multipolar ganglion cells, and the motor functions of Lange's
  nerve and the apical nerve. The study aims to confirm and expand upon the generally
  accepted view of the distribution and function of the nervous system in starfish,
  as described by Cuenot.
