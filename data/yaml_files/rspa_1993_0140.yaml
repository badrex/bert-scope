tldr: The author introduces a new type of harmonic wavelet with a simple structure
  and a compact frequency spectrum, which is useful for analyzing signals in engineering
  problems, particularly in vibration analysis. The harmonic wavelet can be efficiently
  computed using the fast Fourier transform and can be used for both forward and inverse
  transforms. The wavelet's properties, such as orthogonality and scalability, make
  it a valuable tool for signal processing and analysis.
