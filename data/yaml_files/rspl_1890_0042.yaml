tldr: This study investigates the central motor innervation of the larynx through
  excitation experiments. The authors explore the representation of intrinsic laryngeal
  movements in the central nervous system and discuss the physiological differentiation
  in functional activity of these centers and fibers. They also analyze the effects
  of stimulation on the cortex cerebri, respiratory movements, and the floor of the
  fourth ventricle, localizing adduction and abduction movements.
