tldr: The study investigates the anionic permeability of inhibitory postsynaptic membranes
  in hippocampal pyramidal cells. The researchers found that there is a sharp dichotomy
  between permeant and impermeant anions, with permeable anions including Br-, NO3-,
  NO3, SCN-, OCN-, CIO3, and HCO2, while impermeable anions include citrate, glutamate,
  sulfate, methylsulphate, bromate, chromate, acetate, and fluoride. The findings
  suggest that the anion permeability of the inhibitory postsynaptic membrane in hippocampal
  pyramidal cells is similar to that reported for spinal motoneurons.
