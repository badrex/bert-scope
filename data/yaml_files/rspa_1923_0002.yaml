tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the characteristic X-rays emitted
  from light elements, such as carbon and boron, when bombarded by electrons. They
  determined the critical absorption wave-lengths for these elements and discussed
  the implications of their findings in relation to atomic models and spectral series.
  Their work contributed to the understanding of X-ray emission and atomic physics.
