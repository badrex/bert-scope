tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of hydrogen halides (HCl, HBr, and HI)
  on alkali halide surfaces using infrared spectroscopy. The research shows the presence
  of a dominant surface species involving hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen halide
  molecule and a surface anion. The findings reveal interesting differences in adsorption
  on fluoride surfaces compared to chloride to iodide surfaces, providing insights
  into the interactions between adsorbates and alkali halide surfaces.
