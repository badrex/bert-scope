tldr: The authors analyzed the spectrum of H2 molecules and identified the 3d singlet
  bands. They found that the bands have a unique intensity distribution and discussed
  the vibrational and rotational intervals of the bands. The study provides insights
  into the behavior of hydrogen molecules and the underlying quantum mechanics.
