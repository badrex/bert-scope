tldr: This article discusses the origin and early evolution of galaxies, focusing
  on the search for optical evidence of galaxy evolution. The author explores the
  use of deep photographic plates for statistical studies of faint galaxies and the
  implications of their evolution on astrophysics and cosmology. The study of galaxy
  clustering and the correlation of positions can provide insights into physical models
  of clustering over large look-back times.
