tldr: The author discusses the role of covalency in the hydrogen bond and its impact
  on the properties of water and ice. They propose that liquid water consists of co-operatively
  bonded clusters of ice-like material surrounded by non-bonded fluid. This concept
  explains various properties of water, such as its dielectric constant and the behavior
  of aqueous solutions. The author also suggests that the degree of covalency in the
  hydrogen bond may affect the structure and properties of ice.
