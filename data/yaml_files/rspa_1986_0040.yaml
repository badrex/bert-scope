tldr: This article investigates the behavior of an alternating or rotating magnetic
  field diffusing into a two-dimensional wedge of arbitrary angle. The authors reduce
  the problem to a pair of integral equations over the boundary of the wedge, which
  they solve numerically. The results show the variation of the field lines over a
  time period and discuss the implications of the locally large Lorentz force for
  the fluid flow.
