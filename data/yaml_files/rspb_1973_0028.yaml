tldr: 'The authors examined the reflecting materials in the tapeta lucida of three
  teleost fish species: bay anchovy, gizzard shad, and pigfish. They identified the
  reflecting materials as different substances in each species, including triglycerides,
  guanine, and a reduced pteridine. This study provides insights into the variety
  and common characteristics of retinal reflectors in teleost fish eyes.'
