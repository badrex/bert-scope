tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific rotation of crystalline
  ovalbumin and serum albumin to study their purity. They compared two methods of
  coagulation and found that both methods yielded consistent results. The specific
  rotations obtained were constant after the second crystallization, and the authors
  discussed the possibility of slight molecular differences in the albumin from different
  egg sources or differences in crystal formation.
