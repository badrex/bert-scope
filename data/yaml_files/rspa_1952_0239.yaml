tldr: This article discusses experiments on the wear between a metal pin and a hardened
  steel disk. It focuses on the adhesion or galling mechanism, which is responsible
  for friction and wear. The authors found that the volume of material worn away is
  proportional to the load and the distance traveled, and directly proportional to
  the true area of contact. They also discovered that a large increase in wear rate
  occurs at higher loads due to the self-accelerating process of loose wear particles.
