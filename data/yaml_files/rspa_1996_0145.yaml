tldr: The authors developed an advanced optical imaging system that can produce coded
  color images of birefringent materials, representing optical retardation, orientation
  of the optical indicatrix, or transmittance. This system separates the contrast
  components usually seen in a standard crossed-polars experiment, making it a versatile
  and quantitative tool for studying various materials, including crystals, rocks,
  and biological specimens.
