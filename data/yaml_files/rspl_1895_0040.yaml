tldr: The authors investigated the vesicating constituent of croton oil and discovered
  a resinous substance called croton-resin. They found that croton-resin is responsible
  for the vesicating property of croton oil and has a complicated constitution, possibly
  being a lactone or anhydride. The resin is nearly insoluble in water and some organic
  solvents but dissolves in alcohol, ether, and chloroform.
