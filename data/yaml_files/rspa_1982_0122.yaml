revised_title: Asymptotic Analysis of the Barenblatt-Pattle Similarity Solution in
  Nonlinear Diffusion

tldr: The authors study the large-time behavior of the nonlinear diffusion equation
  with compact initial data. They find that the solution approaches the Barenblatt-Pattle
  similarity solution through an infinite sequence of negative real powers of a constant,
  which are called eigenvalues. These eigenvalues and their interactive product terms
  determine the power-series development of the solution as it approaches the similarity
  solution.
