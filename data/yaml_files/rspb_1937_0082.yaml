tldr: The study investigates the impact of various androgenic and oestrogenic compounds
  on the histological structure of the pituitary gland in castrated rats. The results
  show that certain hormone preparations can prevent the development of characteristic
  histological changes in the anterior pituitary of castrated rats. The effectiveness
  of these compounds varies, and they are compared with oestrone and crude testis
  extracts. The study highlights the importance of understanding the oestrogenic and
  androgenic properties of these compounds in treating castration-related changes
  in the pituitary gland.
