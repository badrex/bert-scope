tldr: This article presents an experimental study on the dehydration of copper sulphate
  pentahydrate, investigating the rate of decomposition and the effect of water vapour
  pressure on the reaction. The results show that the dehydration process occurs in
  multiple stages, with the rate of loss of water molecules controlled by the linear
  rate of advance of the interface between the solid phases. The study also highlights
  the influence of water vapour pressure on the reaction, with higher pressures retarding
  the process.
