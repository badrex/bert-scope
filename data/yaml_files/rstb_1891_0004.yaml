tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of increased intra-cranial
  pressure on circulation and respiration. They found that a rise in pressure led
  to changes in the pulse and breathing, which could be used to estimate the severity
  of the condition. The experiments showed how the "centers" regulating heart rate,
  blood pressure, and respiration could be impeded or stopped, allowing for a better
  understanding of their interactions.
