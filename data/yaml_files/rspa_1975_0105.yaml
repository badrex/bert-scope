tldr: The study investigates the interaction of sound with a subsonic cylindrical
  vortex layer, focusing on the generation of instability waves. The research introduces
  a source of sound into the problem and uses a causality criterion to eliminate non-physically
  triggered solutions. The analysis confirms that the central instability wave is
  the only one to be triggered, ruling out other possible solutions as physical impossibilities.
