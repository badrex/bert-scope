tldr: The authors constructed mercury resistance standards to improve the accuracy
  of electrical measurements. They determined the temperature coefficient of resistance
  of mercury, which is essential for calibrating the standards. The study also discussed
  the challenges in measuring the resistance of mercury columns, such as the presence
  of air and moisture films between the mercury and the glass tube. The authors provided
  methods to overcome these challenges and improve the accuracy of the measurements.
