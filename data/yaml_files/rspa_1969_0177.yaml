tldr: The authors investigated the radiation chemistry of liquid and glassy methanol
  using pulse radiolysis, low-temperature optical spectroscopy, and electron spin
  resonance. They studied the behavior of solvated and trapped electrons, as well
  as the reactions of these intermediates with the solvent and various solutes. The
  results provide insights into the radiation-induced processes in alcohols and related
  systems.
