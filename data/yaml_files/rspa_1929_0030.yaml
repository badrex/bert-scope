tldr: The authors studied the effect of an electric field on the adsorption of organic
  molecules in heterogeneous systems, including electrolytes. They found that the
  amount of adsorption depends on the potential difference between the interface and
  the solution, and the electric field strength. The maximum adsorption occurs when
  the potential difference is zero. This research helps to understand the behavior
  of organic molecules at the interface and can be applied to various fields, such
  as electrochemistry and surface chemistry.
