tldr: This article discusses three hypotheses about developmental commitments in the
  Drosophila embryo, including micromosaic models, monotonic gradient models, and
  models based on sequential formation of monotonic and non-monotonic gradients. The
  author assesses current data and experiments related to these hypotheses, focusing
  on the two-dimensional fate map and the role of positional information in embryogenesis.
  The article highlights the need for a better understanding of gene expression patterns
  and the potential of combinatorial systems to encode differentiated states in metazoans.
