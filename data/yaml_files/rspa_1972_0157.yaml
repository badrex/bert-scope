tldr: The author investigates the Bondi-Metzner-Sachs group, a larger group than the
  Poincare group, and its potential role in classifying elementary particles in quantum
  theory. They determine the unitary representations of the group, which are induced
  from irreducible unitary representations of the connected little groups. The author
  shows that the connected little groups are compact, leading to discrete particle
  spins and finite-component wavefunctions, in contrast to the Poincare group, which
  allows both discrete and continuous spins.
