tldr: The author examines the evolution of the vertebral column in fishes, focusing
  on the development of the axial skeleton. They describe the process of segmentation
  and differentiation of the protovertebrae, including the roles of myotomes, sklerotomes,
  and the skeletogenous layer. The study provides insights into the complex development
  of the vertebral column and its significance in the evolution of vertebrates.
