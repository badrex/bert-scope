tldr: The author conducted experiments on isolated human uterus and Fallopian tubes
  to study their response to certain drugs, specifically adrenine and pituitrin. The
  results showed that adrenine has a powerful motor effect on both non-pregnant uterus
  and Fallopian tubes, suggesting that the sympathetic nerve supply to the human uterus
  is motor in quality. In contrast, pituitrin stimulated the contraction of the non-pregnant
  uterus but had no significant effect on the Fallopian tube. This study is important
  for understanding the use of adrenine and other sympathomimetic substances in human
  labor and medical treatments.
