tldr: The author investigates the forces experienced by a body moving through a viscous
  fluid, focusing on the asymptotic flow field at large distances from the body. The
  study provides explicit formulae for the force and couple acting on the body, applicable
  to various shapes and motions, and offers insights into the influence of the far
  field on the drag, side force, and couple experienced by the body.
