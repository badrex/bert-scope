tldr: The article reports on the Fluid-Lens Telescope constructed for the Royal Society,
  with observations and evaluations from members J.F.W. Herschel, G.B. Airy, and W.H.
  Smyth. The telescope is found to have remarkable color dispersion and efficient
  aperture, making it suitable for observing nebulae and other astronomical objects.
  However, it is not ideal for examining bright planets due to color issues and the
  need for a better eyepiece design.
