tldr: The authors study three classic host-parasitoid models and find that chaos in
  these models occurs via quasiperiodicity, a route not commonly associated with population
  models. They also discover that chaos can persist in these models even in the presence
  of small levels of immigration, suggesting that chaos could exist in some natural
  populations despite external perturbations.
