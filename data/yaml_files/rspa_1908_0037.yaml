tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the electrical resistance of
  a wire moving through the ether, aiming to detect the Fitzgerald-Lorentz contraction.
  They used a modified Wheatstone bridge setup and encountered various challenges,
  such as thermoelectric currents, heating effects, and mechanical stress. Despite
  these difficulties, they were unable to observe any significant effect on the electrical
  resistance due to the ether drift or the contraction.
