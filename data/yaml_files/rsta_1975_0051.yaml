tldr: This article discusses the Quaternary glaciation and geomorphology of the English
  Channel. It examines various lines of evidence for former glaciation, including
  geomorphological features such as flat featureless sea beds, terrace forms, and
  palaeovalley systems. The distribution of erratics on the Channel floor and in modern
  and raised beaches of its coasts is attributed to widespread Saalian glaciation.
  The article also explores the different geomorphological features of the Channel
  floor, such as low relief areas, submarine shelves, and submerged cliffs, and their
  significance in understanding the Quaternary history of the region.
