tldr: This study investigates the interaction between the anaesthetic halothane and
  haemoglobin using Fourier transform n.m.r. techniques. The research reveals that
  halothane causes small perturbations in haemoglobin's structure, which persist at
  clinical concentrations and across a wide pH range. These perturbations suggest
  that halothane's interaction with the protein is either highly selective or allows
  only specific distortions to occur. The authors attempt to locate the area of strongest
  interaction between halothane and haemoglobin by analyzing the histidine residues
  affected by the perturbations.
