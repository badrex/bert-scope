tldr: The authors developed a radial-motion expansion cloud-chamber and a falling
  cloud-chamber to study particle tracks and improve cloud-chamber technology. The
  radial-motion cloud-chamber provided a uniform two-dimensional expansion, reducing
  track distortion, while the falling cloud-chamber eliminated the effects of gravity
  and convection currents. These advancements allowed for clearer and more accurate
  track photography in particle physics experiments.
