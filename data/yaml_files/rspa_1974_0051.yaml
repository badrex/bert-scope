tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the chemical shifts of caesium ions
  in solution and tested the validity of the Halliday, Richards, and Sharp (H.R.S.)
  theory. They found that the empirical logarithmic law is an adequate approximation
  for a limited concentration range, and proposed a nonlinear regression method to
  obtain infinite dilution resonance frequencies. The results provide substantial
  confirmation of the H.R.S. theory, showing that the bulk dielectric constant of
  the solvent is a good parameter in the theory.
