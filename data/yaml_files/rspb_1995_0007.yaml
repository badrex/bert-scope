tldr: Dyslexic children show time estimation deficits, suggesting cerebellar dysfunction.
  A time estimation task, considered a sensitive index of cerebellar function, was
  administered to dyslexic and control children. Dyslexic children demonstrated a
  predicted deficit in time estimation but not in a control loudness estimation task.
  Cerebellar dysfunction provides a parsimonious explanation for various deficits
  in dyslexia.
