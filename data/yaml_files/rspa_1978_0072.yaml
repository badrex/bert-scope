tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to measure the optical radiation pressure
  in dispersive media using a torsion balance and a laser beam. They confirmed the
  results of the Jones-Richards experiment, showing that the momentum associated with
  electromagnetic radiation increases directly with the refractive index of the medium.
  The experiment also demonstrated that the magnitude of recoil of a mirror in oblique
  incidence does not vary when the plane of polarization is changed.
