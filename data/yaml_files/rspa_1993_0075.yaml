tldr: The authors used molecular dynamics simulations to study the interactions between
  C60 fullerene molecules and a graphite surface. They found that at low energies,
  the fullerene molecules reflect off the surface with little deformation, while at
  higher energies, the molecules can disintegrate on impact, causing sputtering and
  implantation of denser amorphous carbon beneath the surface.
