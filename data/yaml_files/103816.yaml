tldr: The author presents a new theory on elasticity and its application to the propagation
  of vibrations in elastic bodies. He also explains how this theory can be used to
  understand the behavior of the barometer and predict changes in weather based on
  atmospheric conditions. The author introduces new terms and concepts, such as natural
  and violent equilibrium, and demonstrates their relevance to the study of atmospheric
  phenomena.
