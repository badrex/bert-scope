tldr: This study investigates surface waves on liquid helium-4 and determines their
  velocity over a range of temperatures. The authors compare their findings with classical
  hydrodynamic theory and find no two-fluid effects below the lambda point. They also
  determine the surface tension as a function of temperature and compare it with other
  measurements. The results confirm that surface waves on liquid helium are not affected
  by the superfluid nature of helium below the lambda point, suggesting that the two
  fluids are locked together and move as one under the forces of gravity and surface
  tension.
