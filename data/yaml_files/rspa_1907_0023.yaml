tldr: The author developed a recording calorimeter using a continuous copper strip
  to measure the heat loss during and after explosions. This method allowed for more
  accurate determination of heat loss without relying on specific heat values, providing
  valuable insights into the cooling of hot gases and the combustion of various materials.
