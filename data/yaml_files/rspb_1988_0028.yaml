tldr: The study presents evidence for the synaptic connectivity between a physiologically
  characterized GABAergic interneuron (clutch cell) and a corticotectal pyramidal
  neuron in area 17 of the cat visual cortex. The clutch cell, located in layer 4,
  received direct X-type innervation from the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus, indicating
  that a GABAergic neuron is involved in the first cortical stages of geniculocorticotectal
  interactions.
