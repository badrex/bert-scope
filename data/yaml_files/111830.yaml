tldr: The author, Edward Schunck, investigates the decomposition of rubian and its
  products. He discovers three distinct bodies formed when rubian is exposed to oxygen
  and alkaline substances. These bodies are Rubianic Acid, Rubidehydran, and Rubihydran.
  Schunck also examines the properties and compositions of these substances, as well
  as their reactions with other chemicals. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of the chemical structure and behavior of rubian and its derivatives.
