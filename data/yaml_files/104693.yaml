tldr: The author, Arthur Dobbs, shares his observations on bees and their method of
  gathering wax and honey. He disagrees with some of the findings of M. Reaumur and
  provides alternative insights into bees' foraging behavior and the formation of
  wax. Dobbs also discusses the role of bees in pollination and their contribution
  to the health and life of their own species.
