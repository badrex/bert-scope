tldr: The author examines the Group IV lines of silicium and their presence in stellar
  spectra. They analyze the behavior of these lines under different experimental conditions,
  such as in vacuum tube and spark spectra, and find that the lines are not due to
  air but are strongly connected to silicium in some form. The author concludes that
  the Group IV lines are present in the spectra of belt stars of Orion and other stellar
  spectra, supporting their identity with stellar lines.
