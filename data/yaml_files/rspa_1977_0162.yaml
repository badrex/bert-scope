tldr: The authors studied the effect of viscosity on the free-radical polymerization
  of methyl methacrylate. They found that at high viscosities, chain termination reactions
  are influenced by the rate of translational diffusion of polymer radicals. The polymerization
  rate's dependence on viscosity is less than predicted by a simple kinetic scheme.
  The authors propose that only radicals above a certain size have their chain termination
  reactions controlled by solution viscosity, and this limiting size decreases as
  viscosity increases.
