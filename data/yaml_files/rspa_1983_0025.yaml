tldr: This article presents an exact analysis of the natural frequencies and mode
  shapes of an unsupported elliptical plate with variable thickness, considering the
  influence of middle-surface stresses arising from a planar quadratic temperature
  distribution. The study focuses on the vibrations of plates in high-speed aerodynamics,
  where they may form lifting and control surfaces of missiles.
