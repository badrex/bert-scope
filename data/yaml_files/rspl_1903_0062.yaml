tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the role of blood fluids in
  phagocytosis, a process where white blood cells engulf and destroy bacteria. They
  developed three experimental procedures to test the phagocytic power of blood and
  found that blood fluids play a minor role in the process. This study helps to understand
  the body's immune response to bacterial infections.
