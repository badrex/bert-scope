tldr: This article investigates bounds for the least non-trivial solutions of diagonal
  cubic equations and inequalities. The authors use the Hardy-Littlewood method and
  modify the proof of Birch and Davenport to obtain the required conclusions. The
  results have implications for understanding real cubic forms and their solutions
  in the context of Diophantine analysis.
