tldr: The resistance porometer is a tool used to measure stomatal resistance and study
  stomatal movement in plants. This method allows researchers to observe how stomata
  open and close in response to various factors, such as light and temperature. The
  porometer is particularly useful for studying small stomatal apertures and provides
  a continuous curve of stomatal opening and closing, making it a valuable tool for
  understanding plant physiology and photosynthesis.
