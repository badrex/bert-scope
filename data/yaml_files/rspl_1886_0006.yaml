tldr: This article investigates the straining actions and stresses caused by rolling
  in ships, challenging existing theories and assumptions about stress distribution
  in ship hulls. The author argues that twisting moments have a significant impact
  on stress and that current rules for regulating ship strength do not adequately
  account for these forces.
