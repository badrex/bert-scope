tldr: The authors used Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) to study the conformational
  equilibria in fluorinated alkenes. They found that there are two rotameric forms
  with significant population for each isomer and calculated the enthalpy differences
  between rotamers. The study also revealed that long-range F-F coupling constants
  are large when the interacting nuclei are in close proximity. This research provides
  valuable information on the classification of coupling constants in fluorinated
  alkenes and their characterization.
