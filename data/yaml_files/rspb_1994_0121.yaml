tldr: The author's study investigates the brain's response to the Enigma illusion,
  a static image that some people perceive as moving. Using positron emission tomography
  (PET), the author found that when subjects see motion in the rings of the Enigma,
  increased regional cerebral blood flow occurs in the region of human area V5, a
  visual motion area in the brain. This research shows that activity in specific visual
  areas of the cerebral cortex contributes to the perception of motion in the Enigma
  illusion.
