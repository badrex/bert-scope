tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of light by chlorine,
  bromine, and their gaseous mixtures. They found that the absorption of pure chlorine
  was not affected by the intensity of the light source, and they provided extinction
  coefficients for both chlorine and bromine. The authors also investigated the behavior
  of a chlorine-bromine light filter and observed a "time effect" in its transmission,
  which later disappeared.
