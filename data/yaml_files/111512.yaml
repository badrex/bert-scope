tldr: The author investigates the impact of the Gulf Stream on the winters of the
  British Islands. They argue that an abnormal extension of the warm waters of the
  Gulf Stream towards the British Isles can lead to remarkably mild winters. The author
  provides evidence from temperature data of recent winters, showing that during mild
  winters, the difference in temperature between coastal and inland stations is greater
  than during cold winters. This supports the idea that the Gulf Stream's thermal
  influence plays a significant role in the climate of the British Islands.
