tldr: This article discusses the properties of coherent VLF waves in the magnetosphere,
  focusing on chorus and triggered emissions. It explains their origin, interaction
  with electrons, and their potential applications in diagnostic studies of the magnetosphere,
  plasma physics experiments, controlled precipitation, and VLF communications.
