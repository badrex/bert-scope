tldr: This article investigates the effects of variations in the radiation factor
  on the efficiency of Dewar vessels. The researchers found that the efficiency of
  a Dewar vessel is significantly influenced by the radiation factor, and they provide
  a modified form of the phase rule for neutral masses containing electrolytes. The
  study helps to improve the understanding of heat transfer in Dewar vessels and contributes
  to the development of more efficient storage systems for cryogenic liquids.
