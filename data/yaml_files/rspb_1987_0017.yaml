tldr: This article describes a significant vertebrate fossil assemblage from the Lower
  Cretaceous of Nehden, Sauerland, West Germany. The fossils, including those of Iguanodon,
  were found in a cavern-like deposit at a quarry. The clays in which the fossils
  were buried have been dated as Aptian (Lower Cretaceous) and are similar to those
  found in the Wealden Formation of southeast England and the Bernissartian of southwest
  Belgium. The article discusses the excavation, conservation, and analysis of the
  fossils, and provides insights into the possible causes of the mass accumulation,
  such as flash floods or mudslides.
