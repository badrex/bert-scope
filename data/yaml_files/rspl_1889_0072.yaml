tldr: The author investigates electric discharge between electrodes at different temperatures
  in air and high vacua, focusing on incandescent lamps with an insulated wire or
  plate. They discover that the potential difference between the insulated metal plate
  and the negative electrode is equal to the working potential difference of the lamp.
  The author also observes that the position and material of the metal plate influence
  the current flowing through a galvanometer connected to the lamp.
