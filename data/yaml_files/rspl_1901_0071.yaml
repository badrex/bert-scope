tldr: The report covers the work and findings of the Observatory Department at the
  National Physical Laboratory in 1900. It discusses magnetic observations, meteorology,
  seismology, atmospheric electricity, and platinum thermometry. The Magnetographs
  were in constant operation, and the magnetic elements for the entire year were analyzed.
  The electrograph functioned well, and the International scheme of balloon ascents
  was initiated. The report also includes details on inspections, seismograph operations,
  fog and mist observations, and the performance of various instruments.
