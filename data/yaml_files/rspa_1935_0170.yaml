tldr: This article investigates the thermal stability of the lower atmosphere, focusing
  on the vertical conduction of heat by turbulence. The author derives an equation
  for heat conduction and discusses the conditions for equilibrium, including the
  role of the lapse rate and eddy friction. The study also considers the effects of
  general atmospheric motion and boundary conditions, such as rigid and free surfaces.
