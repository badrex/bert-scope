tldr: The authors present a theoretical investigation of the temperature distribution
  along a thin rod electrically heated in a vacuum. They show that the distribution
  is determined by three parameters and can be expanded as a convergent power series.
  The rod can be divided into two regions, and the temperature distribution in each
  region is found to be parabolic. The results can be used to design heating elements
  and improve understanding of heat transfer in materials.
