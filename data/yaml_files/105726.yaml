tldr: The author, Moses Lindo, discovered a new potential source of dye from the berries
  of a weed in South Carolina. He observed that the berries were initially thought
  to be poisonous, but after seeing birds excreting the same colored waste, he decided
  to experiment with extracting a dye from them. He successfully extracted a black
  dye from the berries without the use of alum, which turned the juice in another
  container containing alum black as well.
