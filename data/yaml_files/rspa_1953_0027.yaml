revised_title: Equilibrium Constants and Bond Dissociation Energies of C2H4+HCl=C2H5Cl
  and C2H4+HBr=C2H5Br Reactions

tldr: The authors studied the equilibrium constants and bond dissociation energies
  of the reactions C2H4+HCl=C2H5Cl and C2H4+HBr=C2H5Br. They used a flow method to
  measure the equilibrium constants and calculated the entropy changes to obtain the
  heat content changes. The results provide valuable information for understanding
  the heat of formation of ethyl halides and the bond dissociation energies of the
  Et-X bonds.
