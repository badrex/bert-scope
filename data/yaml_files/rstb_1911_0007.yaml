tldr: This study investigates the effect of gravity on the movements and aggregation
  of Euglena viridis, a common micro-organism found in water with organic matter.
  The author found that gravity, combined with cohesive forces, causes the organisms
  to form networks or separate groups while remaining in an actively motile condition.
  The research also discusses the seasonal distribution and behavior of Euglena viridis,
  as well as its competition with other organisms.
