tldr: This article discusses the complex mechanisms of anion transport in the colon,
  focusing on the absorption of organic anions like acetate, butyrate, and propionate.
  The author explains that the colon plays a significant role in the conservation
  of inorganic ions and water, and that the anion transport mechanisms are essential
  for understanding cation movements. The study also highlights the importance of
  the colon in the absorption and secretion of anions, and the various factors that
  can influence these processes.
