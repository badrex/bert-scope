revised_title: 'Hopkinson Techniques for Dynamic Recovery Experiments: Enhancing the
  Split Hopkinson Bar Method'
scientific_discipline: Engineering and Technology > Materials Science
semantic_tags:

- Strain Rate
tldr: The authors introduce novel techniques to improve the split Hopkinson bar method
  for dynamic recovery experiments, allowing for full recovery tests on various materials
  in compression, tension, and stress reversal. These techniques enable better understanding
  of material properties and microstructural evolution under different loading conditions.
