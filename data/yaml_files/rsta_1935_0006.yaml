tldr: The author analyzes the mathematical aspects of the zenith-light method for
  studying ozone distribution in the atmosphere. They focus on primary scattered light
  and examine special cases of ozone distribution, such as uniformly exponential atmospheres
  and atmospheres with varying air density. The study aims to improve our understanding
  of the method and its applications to atmospheric problems, including radio waves
  scattered and absorbed in the ionosphere.
