tldr: This study investigates the impact of lesions in the middle sector of the dorsolateral
  frontal cortex on non-human primates' ability to recall their choices of visual
  stimuli. The results show that these lesions cause a significant impairment in recall
  without affecting the recognition of the stimuli. The findings highlight the critical
  role of the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex in monitoring self-generated responses.
