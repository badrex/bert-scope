tldr: The author, Dionysius Lardner, challenges the assumption that compressing aqueous
  vapor would restore a portion of it to the liquid state. He argues that this idea
  contradicts the doctrine of latent heat and the results of experiments showing that
  the amount of heat needed to convert water into steam remains constant under all
  pressures. Lardner suggests that compression only evolves heat and raises the temperature,
  while expansion absorbs heat and lowers it. The restoration of vapor to the liquid
  form is due to the abstraction of heat, regardless of the state of density. He also
  considers permanent gases as vapors containing a large amount of redundant heat.
