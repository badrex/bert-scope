tldr: The author conducted a magnetic survey in the east of France in 1869 to study
  the Earth's magnetic field. They collected data on magnetic declination, dip, and
  intensity at various locations using multiple instruments. The results showed a
  mean annual change in the dip and provided insights into the secular variation of
  the Earth's magnetic field in the region. The study also compared the findings with
  previous observations in the west of France.
