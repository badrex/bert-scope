tldr: The authors investigate the order-disorder phenomena in α-brass by studying
  the development of order in slowly cooled and isothermally annealed specimens. They
  observe an absorption of energy associated with the destruction of order and attribute
  it to the destruction of long-range and short-range order. The results provide insights
  into the ordering process in α-brass, which can be useful for understanding its
  properties and potential applications.
