tldr: This article discusses the tectonic settings of regional metamorphism and the
  connection to the history of continental crust. It highlights the importance of
  understanding processes associated with continental growth and the role of subduction
  and collision-related phenomena in shaping the Earth's crust. The author emphasizes
  the need for integrating petrology and geophysics to develop better models of dynamics
  and thermal history.
