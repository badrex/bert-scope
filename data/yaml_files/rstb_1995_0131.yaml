tldr: The authors present a novel cell-ablation strategy for studying plant development,
  using promoters with distinct cell specificities fused with cytotoxic and anticytotoxic
  genes. They demonstrate the potential of this strategy by applying it to anther
  development, highlighting the importance of understanding plant cell differentiation
  processes.
