tldr: The article discusses the geological evolution of Tibet, focusing on the structure
  of the 1985 Tibet Geotraverse from Lhasa to Golmud. It describes the accretion of
  various crustal blocks onto the Asian continent and the different phases of deformation
  that occurred during the process. The study provides insights into the complex history
  of Tibet's geological structures and helps to understand the formation of the Tibetan
  Plateau.
