tldr: This study examines the genetic success and gene flow in a population of mice
  after introducing mice from the islands of May and Eday. The results show that introduced
  male genes spread more extensively than maternally inherited genes, suggesting that
  sexual selection plays a role in gene flow. This research has implications for understanding
  the genetic structure of populations and the reintroduction of endangered mammals
  into wild populations.
