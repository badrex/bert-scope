tldr: The author, Thomas Grubb, discusses improvements to the spectroscope design
  to enhance its research capabilities. He proposes a simple solution to straighten
  spectral lines by using a special slit instead of a rectangular one, which can improve
  the overall performance of the spectroscope. This innovation can be particularly
  useful in spectroscopes with multiple prisms, where the curvature of spectral lines
  becomes more pronounced.
