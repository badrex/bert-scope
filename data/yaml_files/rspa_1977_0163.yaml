tldr: This article extends the general theory of elastic stability to include the
  imperfection-sensitivity of twofold compound branching points with symmetry of the
  potential function in one of the critical modes (semi-symmetric points of bifurcation).
  The author introduces a subclassification into monoclinal, anticlinal, and homeoclinal
  semi-symmetric branching and relates this bifurcation theory to Rene Thom's catastrophe
  theory. The paper presents an imperfection-sensitivity perturbation analysis for
  semi-symmetric branching, providing a complete description of the imperfection-sensitivity
  surface in the dimensional space.
