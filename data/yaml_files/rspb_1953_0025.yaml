tldr: The authors used X-ray scattering to study the structure of various proteins
  in their native and denatured states. They found that the fundamental structure
  of the proteins remains the same in both states, with the polypeptide chains folding
  in a similar way. The results support the alpha-helix model for protein structure
  and suggest that the alpha-helix is resistant to moderate heating in the absence
  of other factors.
