tldr: The author's study found that in a muscle twitch, the heat produced is independent
  of the work done, as long as the amount of shortening remains constant. The energy
  liberated during a muscle twitch can be expressed as (A - W + ax), where A is the
  heat of activation, W is the work, and ax is the heat of shortening. This relation
  holds true for any part of the contraction. The study also confirmed that the rate
  of extra energy liberation during a muscle twitch is a linear function of the load.
