tldr: The authors developed a new differential dilatometer to measure volume changes
  during solidification accurately. They tested the device on lead-tin and tin-bismuth
  eutectic alloys, demonstrating its reliability and usefulness in studying the factors
  affecting casting production. The new dilatometer eliminates many errors from previous
  methods, making it a valuable tool for the metal industry.
