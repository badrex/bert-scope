tldr: The authors present a method for accurately calculating eigenvalues and eigenfunctions
  of the anharmonic oscillator, a quantum mechanical system with applications in molecular
  physics and field theory. Their approach uses an appropriately scaled basis for
  the expansion of each eigenfunction, allowing for uniform and high accuracy in all
  regimes of the quantum number and anharmonicity constant. This method also provides
  eigenfunctions of comparable accuracy for computing matrix elements of operators.
