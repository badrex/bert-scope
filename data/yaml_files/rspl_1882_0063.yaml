tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the absolute value of the British
  Association unit of resistance and the pitch of a standard tuning-fork. They used
  different methods, including Lorentz's method, and found close agreement in their
  results. The authors also discussed the determination of the absolute pitch of a
  tuning-fork used as a time standard in their work.
