tldr: The article describes the crystal and molecular structure of a 1:1 complex of
  5-bromouridine and dimethylsulphoxide. The structure was determined using X-ray
  diffraction data and revealed that hydrogen bonds form between the oxygen atom of
  the DMSO molecule and the 03' and 05' of the BUR molecules. The findings provide
  insights into the interactions between purines and pyrimidines, which are crucial
  for understanding the structure of nucleic acids.
