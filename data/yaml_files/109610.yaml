tldr: Dr. William Herschel observed the planet Saturn and found it to have a unique
  flattened shape at the poles. He compared Saturn's shape to that of Jupiter and
  found differences in their figures. He also measured the dimensions of Saturn's
  figure and provided a corrected drawing. These observations may help understand
  the matter in Saturn's ring and the effect of gravity on planetary figures.
