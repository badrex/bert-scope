tldr: This article presents a new method for solving systems of linear indeterminate
  equations and congruences using the concept of fundamental sets of solutions. The
  author demonstrates a criterion for resolubility or irresolubility of these systems
  and applies the method to various problems in number theory, including the Pellian
  equation and the norm of complex integral numbers.
