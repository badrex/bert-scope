tldr: The authors studied the effect of linear energy transfer on the radiolysis of
  cyclohexane. They found that iodine acts as a radical scavenger, reducing dimer
  yield and producing cyclohexyl iodide. The effectiveness of iodine depends on the
  concentration, phase, and temperature of cyclohexane. The results show that iodine
  is more effective in solid and liquid cyclohexane irradiated near the melting point
  but less effective for low-temperature irradiation followed by warming. The data
  are compared with a one-radical diffusion model, showing good agreement.
