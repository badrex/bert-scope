tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the brightness of luminescence
  and the concentration of activators in solid solutions. The authors propose that
  the luminescent center consists of a definite number of solvent molecules associated
  with one molecule of the activator. They develop a theory and provide experimental
  evidence to support their findings, which can help explain the existence of an optimum
  concentration for luminescence.
