tldr: The author, Henry Foster, conducted experiments with an invariable pendulum
  at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich and Port Bowen to measure the rate of a clock
  and determine the latitude of Port Bowen. The experiments involved precise observations
  of the pendulum's vibrations, taking into account various factors such as temperature,
  elevation, and buoyancy. The results allowed the author to calculate the ellipticity
  of the Earth and improve timekeeping and navigation.
