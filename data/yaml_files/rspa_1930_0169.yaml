tldr: The authors, Cockcroft and Walton, conducted experiments with high velocity
  positive ions and developed methods to accelerate them. They used a canal ray tube
  as a source of ions and explored various techniques for ion acceleration, including
  Tesla coils, impulse voltages, low frequency alternating potentials, and rectified
  steady potentials. Their work contributed to the understanding of nuclear physics
  and artificial disintegration.
