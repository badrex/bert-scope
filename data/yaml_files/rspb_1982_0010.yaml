tldr: The author studies the heterostyled tropical tree, Cratoxylum formosum, and
  its unique pollen economy and incompatibility system. The tree has two types of
  flowers with different stamen and stigma heights, ensuring that only compatible
  pollinations occur. The author discovers that the tree's anther arrangement and
  stamen movement play a crucial role in effective pollination, and that the pollen
  transport system is safe and efficient despite the tree's unusual morphology.
