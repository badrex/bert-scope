tldr: The author discovered a new constituent in the blood that plays a crucial role
  in blood coagulation. This substance, found in the plasma, is responsible for inducing
  coagulation and is influenced by an individual's diet. The author also found that
  leucocytes break down to contribute to this substance, providing insight into the
  process of assimilation. Additionally, the author observed that fibrin can be deposited
  from blood by simple physical means, without any ferment process, which may be important
  in thrombus formation.
