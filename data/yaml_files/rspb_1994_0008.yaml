tldr: The author conducted experiments with the ant species Leptothorax acervorum
  to study egg cannibalism and its effect on reproductive skew in multiple-queen ant
  societies. The results showed that queens preferentially ate non-nestmate eggs but
  did not show a significant preference for nestmate or their own eggs. This suggests
  that mutual egg-eating within colonies does not affect the stable reproductive skew,
  and once established, indiscriminate egg-eating could be evolutionarily stable.
