tldr: The authors conducted a detailed study of the reaction and energy levels of
  Be and Beryllium using nuclear emulsions and synchrotron bremsstrahlung. They determined
  the mechanism of the reaction, the multipole character of the initial gamma-ray
  interaction, and the properties of energy levels. The study also discussed the relationship
  of the reaction to other photodisintegration reactions and demonstrated the strong
  influence of isotopic spins on the decay of the nucleus.
