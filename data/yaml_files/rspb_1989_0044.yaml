tldr: The study investigates the foraging behavior and shell crushing efficiency of
  the tropical crab Ozius verreauxii, which feeds on gastropods like Nerita scabricosta.
  The crab's specialized chelal morphology allows it to break open shells effectively,
  and its foraging tactics differ from those of the temperate crab Carcinus maenas.
  The research finds that the crab can assess the defensive strength of its prey and
  select suitable sizes for consumption.
