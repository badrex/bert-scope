tldr: This article critically examines three common methods for estimating amino nitrogen
  in complex fluid mixtures, discussing their limitations and proposing a more accurate
  approach for their application. The authors analyze the distribution of nitrogen
  in plant extracts and explore various methods of decolorization, ultimately concluding
  that electrodialysis is not suitable for routine analysis due to its inefficiency
  and potential for errors.
