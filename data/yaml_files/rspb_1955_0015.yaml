tldr: The authors studied the reactions of earthworm and lugworm hemoglobins with
  oxygen and carbon monoxide, finding that the rates of reaction are similar to those
  of mammalian hemoglobin. They discovered species differences in the course of the
  reactions, which may be attributed to variations in the arrangement of hem groups
  within the molecule. The research provides insights into the kinetics of hemoglobin
  reactions in invertebrates.
