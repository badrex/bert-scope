tldr: This study investigates the palaeomagnetism of Mount Etna's lavas to determine
  the history of the geomagnetic field direction over the past centuries. The research
  uses lavas that became magnetized during cooling and employs modern techniques to
  reduce measurement errors. The results show a trend of the archaeomagnetic variation
  over 600 years, in agreement with other observatories' findings. However, reaching
  further into the past is limited by the lack of accurate historical records and
  thermoluminescence dating methods.
