tldr: The author investigates the effects of heparin on blood coagulation and its
  role as an antithrombase, antiprothrombase, and antikinase. They find that heparin
  acts as a powerful antithrombase when added to oxalated plasma but has little effect
  on the coagulation of fibrinogen. The study also shows that heparin's antithrombase
  action is dependent on the presence of neutral salts, and it does not prevent the
  activation of prothrombase by kinase and calcium salts.
