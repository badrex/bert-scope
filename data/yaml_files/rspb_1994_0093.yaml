tldr: The study investigates the composition of the interstitial fluid in the honeybee
  drone's retina, focusing on the supply of substrates for energy metabolism from
  blood to neurons. The research reveals that the extracellular concentrations of
  amino acids, such as proline, glutamine, alanine, and (3-alanine, are higher than
  in the haemolymph. The identified carbohydrates, trehalose, glucose, pyruvate, and
  fructose, are less concentrated than in the haemolymph. These findings suggest that
  the extracellular concentration of alanine is ample for it to serve as a major substrate
  of neuronal energy metabolism in the retina.
