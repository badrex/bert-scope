tldr: In 1769, Alexander Aubert observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from Austin
  Friars, London. He recorded the event, noting that Venus appeared to be in contact
  with the Sun at 7:26:45 and the Sun's limb was completed about 6 minutes later.
  The clock used for the observation was accurate to within less than one second,
  having been compared with other solar altitudes.
