tldr: This article discusses the life and work of George Boole, who developed an algebraic
  approach to logic. Boole's work built upon the foundations of symbolic algebra and
  expanded the scope of mathematical analysis. His ideas were influenced by contemporaries
  like De Morgan and Hamilton, and his work laid the groundwork for modern logic and
  probability theory.
