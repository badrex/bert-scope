tldr: This preface discusses the history and growth of interest in neurotrophic factors,
  particularly neurotrophins, and their roles in the development, maintenance, and
  injury of sensory neurons. The text highlights the expanding multidisciplinary research
  on neurotrophins and their potential applications in various fields, such as signal
  transduction pathways and therapeutic agents.
