tldr: The authors extend Sverdrup's critical depth model by removing its simplifying
  assumptions and provide an exact expression for the critical depth in terms of a
  generalized, biomass-specific, loss term. They calculate the loss term as the sum
  of contributions from algal respiration and excretion, grazing by micro- and macro-zooplankton,
  and sedimentation. The study highlights the importance of refining the model rather
  than rejecting it, as it remains relevant for understanding the progression and
  biogeochemical significance of the spring bloom in the ocean and the ocean carbon
  cycle.
