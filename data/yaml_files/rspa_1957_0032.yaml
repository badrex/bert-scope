tldr: The authors used an optical method called Lipson's optical diffractometer to
  study the diffraction patterns of crystals with dislocations. They found that the
  intensity distribution around ideal reciprocal lattice points is complex, but for
  certain points, it is in agreement with Suzuki's theory. The study also revealed
  that the diffraction patterns from crystals with various arrays of dislocations
  can be determined using the optical method.
