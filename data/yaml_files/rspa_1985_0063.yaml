tldr: This article examines the existence and multiplicity of capillary-gravity waves
  when the surface tension is close to a value where the critical phase speed has
  multiplicity two. The authors analyze the bifurcation and secondary bifurcation
  of these waves using a new integral equation formulation and Lyapunov-Schmidt reduction
  procedure. The study provides a rigorous treatment of the capillary-gravity wave
  problem and reveals the main phenomena involved in this significant setting.
