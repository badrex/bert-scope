tldr: This article discusses the methods for solving systems of simultaneous partial
  differential equations, focusing on the concept of complete bidifferentials. The
  author presents a method to find the complete primitives of such systems, considering
  cases of equations of the first order and second order with two independent variables.
  The importance of complete bidifferentials in the theory of differential equations
  is also explored.
