revised_title: Pressure Dependence and Kinetics of Paraffin Hydrocarbon Decomposition

- Pressure dependence
- Paraffin hydrocarbons
- Reaction order
tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of normal paraffin hydrocarbons
  and found that the reaction order changes from the first to the second and back
  to the first as pressure increases. This unusual behavior is due to a kinetically
  composite mechanism, which is physical in nature and related to modes of activation
  rather than chemical decomposition. The findings have significant theoretical implications
  for understanding the decomposition process.
