tldr: The study investigates the role of extracellular anions in the secretion of
  saliva by the rabbit mandibular gland in vitro. The researchers found that complete
  replacement of with also enhances secretion, while replacement with or isethionate
  supports secretion but at diminishing rates. The data suggest that an electroneutral
  cotransport model or a double countertransport plus model may be the basis of primary
  salivary secretion. Ductal modification of primary saliva is inhibited by omission,
  which may be related to an effect on the postulated exchange mechanism in the luminal
  duct membrane.
