tldr: This article explores the legacy of Sir Isaac Newton's Principia and its applications
  in various scientific fields. It discusses the impact of computers on the study
  of chaotic motions, the use of Newtonian mechanics in molecular dynamics simulations
  of protein molecules, and the application of Newtonian mechanics in engineering,
  particularly in assessing the dynamic stability of structures in waves and currents.
