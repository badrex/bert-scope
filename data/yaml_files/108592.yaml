tldr: The author presents a mathematical study on the enumeration of polyhedra with
  triangular summits and a (x-1)-gonal base. The paper explores the properties of
  these polyhedra, including their faces and summits, and provides methods for cutting
  and rearranging them to create different polyhedra. The study covers various types
  of polyhedra, such as reversible, irreversible, doubly reversible, and triply irreversible,
  and their corresponding arrangements.
