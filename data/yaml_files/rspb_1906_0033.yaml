tldr: This study investigates the effects of increased barometric pressure on human
  health and diving safety. The authors found that an adult can safely experience
  a total barometric pressure of at least 7 atmospheres, which is higher than previous
  limits. They also discovered that the limit for safe diving is about 210 feet, which
  could be extended by diluting the air with nitrogen. The researchers emphasize the
  importance of proper decompression techniques to prevent accidents and fatalities
  in caisson works and diving.
