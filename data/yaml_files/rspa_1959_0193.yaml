tldr: The authors conducted experiments using ultrasonic dispersion measurements to
  study the probability of transition between translational and vibrational energy
  in homomolecular collisions. They discovered that molecules with a distribution
  of fundamental frequencies undergo a single relaxation process, while molecules
  with a large gap between fundamental frequencies experience a double relaxation
  process. The results provide insights into the correlation between molecular structure
  and energy transition probability.
