tldr: This article presents an analysis of the sliding window decorrelation algorithm
  (SLWA) in direct sequence code division multiple access (DS-CDMA) mobile radio systems.
  The authors develop a mathematical model for a multi-user CDMA system incorporating
  a sliding window decorrelator and investigate performance under practical limitations.
  They also discuss decorrelation in mobile radio channels and present results from
  a simulation model, demonstrating the effectiveness of the SLWA in overcoming the
  near-far problem in multipath fading environments.
