tldr: The authors examine the osteology of the fish Polyodon folium and discuss its
  relationship to other fish species and amphibians. They suggest that Polyodon has
  a unique combination of features from both fish and amphibian groups, which indicates
  a close relationship between the two. The authors also propose a possible evolutionary
  pathway for the development of fish and amphibians.
