tldr: The authors present a calculation for the energies and wavefunctions of neon
  with full electronic correlation accuracy. They used the transcorrelated wave equation
  method to obtain more accurate results than previous methods. The wavefunction data
  is compact and can be easily assessed, providing a basis for further progress in
  the field.
