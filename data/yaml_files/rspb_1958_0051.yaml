tldr: The author investigates the relationship between force developed and energy
  liberated in an isometric twitch, finding that the ratio P/IJH is nearly constant
  over a wide range of muscle lengths. The author also discusses the importance of
  minimizing compliance in the recording equipment to obtain accurate measurements
  and suggests that the ultimate value of P/IJH would be around 13 if compliance from
  the muscle itself, tendons, and other factors could be eliminated.
