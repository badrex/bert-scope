tldr: The authors observed the radiation from a radio star passing through the outer
  regions of the solar corona using radio interferometry. They found that the recorded
  intensity decreased rapidly as the radial distance from the sun decreased. The results
  could not be explained by absorption or large-scale refraction effects in the corona,
  but a scattering mechanism due to irregular variations of electron density in the
  corona provided a satisfactory explanation. The authors estimated the size and electron
  density of the coronal irregularities in the range of 5 to 15 solar radii.
