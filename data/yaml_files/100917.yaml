tldr: In a letter to the publisher, Monsieur Hevelius describes his observations of
  a new comet seen in Dantzick in March 1672. The comet was visible for a few weeks
  and was located near the stars in the right arm of Andromeda. Hevelius plans to
  make more accurate observations with his brass octant and hopes to hear about other
  nations' observations. The letter also mentions that the comet was seen in Paris
  and La Flesche around the same time.
