  Applications'

tldr: The authors present two theorems related to the electrical properties of rotating
  bodies, specifically focusing on the behavior of harmonic components and the skin
  effect in rapidly rotating conductors. These theorems help explain the interaction
  between the rotating body, surrounding circuitry, and brushes, and have applications
  in the design and analysis of homopolar generators.
