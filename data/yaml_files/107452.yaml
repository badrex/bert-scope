tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the relative capacities of venous
  and arterial blood for heat and the temperatures of different parts of the animal
  body. They found that the temperatures of venous and arterial blood were similar,
  and the specific caloric of venous blood was slightly lower than arterial blood.
  The author also observed the temperatures of various parts of the human body and
  animals, providing insights into the distribution of heat within the body.
