  Adaptation'

tldr: The study investigates the effect of field size and pattern on visual sensitivity
  and adaptation. It shows that the threshold brightness remains constant for larger
  conditioning fields, but increases to a maximum and then decreases for smaller fields.
  The findings suggest that the conditioning field raises the threshold brightness
  through integrative effects and pattern interference, which vary depending on the
  retinal area and brightness level.
