tldr: The author continues their research on the dispersion of light, comparing the
  theoretical refractive index from M. Cauchy's system of undulations to observed
  values in various media. They also discuss new findings from M. Rudberg, including
  refractive indices for standard rays in calcareous spar and quartz, as well as the
  action of light on plants and the atmosphere.
