tldr: This article discusses the use of the atmospheric Cherenkov technique in gamma-ray
  astronomy to search for exploding primordial black holes. The technique involves
  detecting the Cherenkov radiation produced when high-energy particles interact with
  the Earth's atmosphere. The authors describe the setup and limitations of this method,
  as well as potential improvements and future applications.
