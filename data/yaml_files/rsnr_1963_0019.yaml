tldr: The article discusses the historical event of the Royal Society's rejection
  of John Herapath's kinetic theory of gases in 1821. Herapath's theory was opposed
  by Humphry Davy, who held the position of the society's president at the time. The
  rejection of Herapath's theory highlights the distinction between the kinetic and
  vibration theories of heat and sheds light on the character of early 19th-century
  British science. Despite the rejection, Herapath's theory later influenced the development
  of the kinetic theory of gases by scientists like Joule, Kronig, Clausius, and Maxwell.
