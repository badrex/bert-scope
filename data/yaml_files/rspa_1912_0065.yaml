tldr: The authors conducted a quantitative investigation of the absorption spectra
  of uranous chloride in various solvents. They discovered that the absorption spectra
  change significantly depending on the solvent, with some solvents causing a shift
  in the absorption bands and others splitting the bands into fine absorption lines.
  This study highlights the importance of considering the solvent when analyzing absorption
  spectra.
