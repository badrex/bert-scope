tldr: The authors study the steady flow of a viscous fluid past a fixed spherical
  obstacle using Oseen's approximation. They derive equations to calculate the drag
  on the sphere and provide a table of drag coefficients for various Reynolds numbers.
  This work helps to understand fluid dynamics and the behavior of fluids around objects.
