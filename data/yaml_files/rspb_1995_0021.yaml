tldr: This study investigates visual cues to age by using facial composites that blend
  shape and colour information from multiple faces. The research finds that perceived
  age of adult male faces is, on average, an accurate index of their chronological
  age. The techniques used provide an empirical definition of facial changes with
  age that are biologically consistent across a sample population. The perceived age
  of a blend of old faces is increased by exaggerating the RGB colour differences
  of each pixel relative to a blend of young faces.
