tldr: The authors examined the ultrastructure of chylomicra, which are small fat particles
  in the lymph and blood, and artificial fat emulsions using electron microscopy.
  They found that chylomicra have a core made of triglycerides and a surface layer
  of phospholipids. The authors also discovered that the ultrastructure of chylomicra
  and artificial fat emulsions, like Intralipid, are very similar. This study provides
  insights into the composition and processing of lipids for electron microscopy.
