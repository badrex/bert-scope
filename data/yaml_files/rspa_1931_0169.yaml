tldr: The authors studied the behavior of gelatine membranes in acetate buffer solutions
  to understand the membrane potential and its equilibrium conditions. They found
  that the membrane potential varies continuously with the concentration of the system
  and that the equilibrium membrane potential is determined by the buffer solution.
  The results provide insights into the chemical nature of the membrane and its influence
  on the diffusion of ions across it.
