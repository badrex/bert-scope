tldr: The author investigates the stratifications in electrical discharges in various
  vacua, including Torricellian and other rarefied media. They observe that the cloud-like
  stratifications depend on the perfection of the vacuum and the absence of moisture.
  The author also studies the effects of different gases on the discharge's appearance
  and behavior, such as hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen. They describe the white-tongue
  and blue-tongue discharges, which are influenced by magnets.
