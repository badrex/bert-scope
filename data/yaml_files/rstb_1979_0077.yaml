tldr: Researchers developed an airborne radar technique to study the behavior and
  control of migrating pest insects, such as the spruce budworm moth. The radar system
  allowed them to detect and track insect density, height, and orientation during
  flight. This technique helped them understand how weather systems, like sea breezes,
  affect insect migration and distribution, which can aid in controlling pest populations.
