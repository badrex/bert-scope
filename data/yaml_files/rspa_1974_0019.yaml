tldr: The article explores the isometric motion of a charged fluid in the Einstein-Maxwell
  theory, showing that a class of four-dimensional charged fluid space-times exists,
  satisfying conditions that include isometric fluid motion, the dual of the electromagnetic
  field tensor having no projection in the direction of a Killing vector, and a constant
  ratio of charge to mass. A spherically symmetric solution is obtained using hypergeometric
  functions.
