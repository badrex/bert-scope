tldr: The authors studied the conductivity and dissociation of aqueous solutions of
  lanthanum ferricyanide. They found that the salt behaves as a weak electrolyte in
  dilute solutions and that its conductivity and dissociation are influenced by concentration.
  The results suggest that the lanthanum ion's large hydration energy does not change
  significantly when forming ion pairs.
