- Laplace's tidal equation
tldr: The author derives Laplace's tidal equation from the theory of inertial oscillations
  in a rotating fluid. They show that the equation can be obtained by applying boundary
  conditions to the differential equation governing inertial oscillations, demonstrating
  the connection between the two concepts.
