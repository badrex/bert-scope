tldr: This article discusses the importance of measuring and interpreting changes
  of strain in the Earth, focusing on the development of advanced instruments, such
  as accelerometers and strain gauges, and their applications in geophysics. The authors
  explore various techniques and methods for measuring strain, including the use of
  tilt meters, gravity meters, and strain gauges, and their implications for geology
  and engineering.
