tldr: The authors present new classes of exact solutions for the Navier-Stokes equations
  in shear flows, describing spatially periodic disturbances within two- and three-dimensional
  basic shear flows. These solutions, called Kelvin modes, have time-dependent wavenumber
  and velocity components and can either decay or grow continuously despite viscous
  dissipation. The study includes two-dimensional flows with uniform vorticity and
  stagnation point flows.
