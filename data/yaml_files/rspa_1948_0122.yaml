tldr: The authors present a theory of electrodynamics without singularities by introducing
  a parameter corresponding to the electron's radius in a relativistically invariant
  way. They use a four-dimensional function to smoothen the charge distribution, resulting
  in finite electromagnetic field quantities and equations of motion. This approach
  resolves the issues faced in the traditional point electron theory and provides
  a more consistent framework for classical electrodynamics.
