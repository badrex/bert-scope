tldr: This study investigates the embrittlement of low alloy steel caused by boron,
  focusing on the effects of prior austenite grain boundaries. The research shows
  that the presence of boron leads to a reduction in steel's mechanical properties,
  particularly when it segregates at austenite grain boundaries. The findings highlight
  the importance of understanding and controlling the effects of boron in steel production
  to prevent embrittlement and improve material properties.
