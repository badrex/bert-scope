tldr: The author investigates the impact of astigmatism on the response function of
  an optical system using Fourier analysis. They develop an analytical study of astigmatic
  optical systems and provide a simple criterion for testing astigmatic systems. The
  study also determines tolerances on astigmatism and Petzval curvature, and compares
  the results with geometrical treatment.
