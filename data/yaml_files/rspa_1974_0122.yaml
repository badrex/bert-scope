tldr: This article discusses the past and potential non-ferrous metalliferous mineral
  production in the United Kingdom, focusing on the value of these resources and their
  impact on countryside conservation. The author estimates the total value of past
  production to be £5.95 billion and suggests that future production in Wales and
  Scotland appears to be the most promising. The article also highlights the importance
  of considering the environmental impact of mining operations and the need for responsible
  exploitation of these resources.
