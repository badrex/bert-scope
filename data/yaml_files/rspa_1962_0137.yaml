tldr: The article presents a method to obtain the joint probability generating function
  for the sizes of generations in a cascade process with discrete time and a positive
  integral number of female sexes. The author demonstrates the power of the result
  by showing how it can be used to make several deductions and provides examples of
  applications and related work.
