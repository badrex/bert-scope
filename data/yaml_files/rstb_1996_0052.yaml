tldr: This article discusses the control of cell-specificity in Bacillus subtilis
  through the regulation of transcription factors, specifically sigma factors. The
  authors describe the role of sigma factors in gene expression during sporulation
  and how the activity of the sigma factor (aF) is regulated by an anti-sigma factor,
  SpoIIAB, which is controlled by an anti-anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAA. The biochemical
  basis for the temporal and spatial regulation of aF activity is also explored, including
  the potential role of changes in adenine nucleotides.
