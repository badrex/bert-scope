tldr: Humphry Davy's experiments on the decomposition of fixed alkalies using electricity
  led to the discovery of new substances that constitute their bases. These substances
  have unique properties, such as being lighter than water and having a strong affinity
  for oxygen. The findings expanded the understanding of chemical changes and the
  nature of alkaline bodies.
