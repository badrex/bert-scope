tldr: The authors developed a simple horizon test to study the fluidity of molten
  organic salts and their mesophases. They found that sodium isovalerate behaves as
  a completely fluid melt above 260Â°C, while molten sodium w-butyrate remains fluid
  throughout its entire mesophase range. The test provides insights into the mechanical
  properties and fluidity of these organic salts, which have complex melting mechanisms
  and unique characteristics.
