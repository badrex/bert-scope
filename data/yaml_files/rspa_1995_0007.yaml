tldr: This article studies the fluid dynamics of shape transitions in lipid domains
  at the air-water interface. The authors analyze the time-dependent distortions of
  nearly circular liquid domains of lipids, considering line tension, electrostatic
  effects, and viscous effects in both the monolayer and subphase fluid. The growth
  rate of small amplitude disturbances is determined as a function of the distortion
  symmetry number, domain radius, dipole density difference, and line tension between
  the lipid domain and surrounding lipid layer, and the viscosities of the monolayer
  and underlying liquid. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of domain
  shape changes and the role of viscous effects, line tension, and electrostatic forces.
