tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin
  B, focusing on the formation of uroporphyrinogen III. The author explains the enzymatic
  processes involved in the rearrangement of porphobilinogen into uroporphyrinogen
  III, which is crucial for the formation of haem, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12. The
  article also highlights the use of carbon-13 labeling and the study of intermediates
  to understand the biosynthetic process.
