tldr: The authors investigated the hyperfine structure of the Zeeman components in
  the resonance lines of sodium using an atomic beam and a double etalon system. They
  found that the nuclear spin of sodium could be established by resolving the hyperfine
  structure lines in a strong magnetic field. The results were compared with quantum
  mechanical theory, showing perfect agreement up to the limit of experimental accuracy.
  This study provided a more accurate test of the theory over a greater range of field
  strengths than previous research on thallium.
