tldr: This article explores embedding theorems and the spectra of certain differential
  operators. The authors provide conditions on the coefficients that ensure the spectrum
  is discrete and necessary conditions for discreteness. These results extend the
  Molcanov criterion and have applications to higher-order weighted Sobolev spaces.
  The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of differential equations
  and their associated operators.
