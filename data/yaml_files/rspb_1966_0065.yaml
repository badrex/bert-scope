tldr: This study examines the connective tissue lining of aortic grafts and compares
  it to extravascular connective tissue. The researchers found that while the grafts
  were successfully organized by connective tissue, a layer of endothelium did not
  develop against the occluding Perspex rod. This differs from the reaction observed
  in rabbit ear chambers, where a layer of endothelium eventually developed on the
  surface of the healing tissue in contact with the Perspex lid.
