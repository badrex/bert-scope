tldr: The author examines the nasal bones of various Phascolomys species, including
  Phascolomys vombatus, Phascolomys platyrhinus, and Phascolomys latifrons, to understand
  their differences and similarities. They also analyze a fossil skull of Phascolomys
  Mitchelli and compare it to the other species, focusing on the nasal bones and skull
  morphology. This study helps in differentiating and understanding the taxonomy of
  these marsupial species.
