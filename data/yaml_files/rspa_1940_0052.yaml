tldr: This article investigates the photolysis of ammonia and its effect on atomic
  hydrogen concentration. The authors conducted experiments using mercury-sensitized
  production and para-hydrogen conversion to measure the rate of hydrogen atom production.
  They found that the primary dissociation of ammonia is not as efficient as previously
  thought, and the products of ammonia decomposition do not remove hydrogen atoms
  abnormally quickly.
