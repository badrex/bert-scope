tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of cane sugar solution
  on the development of Rana temporaria (European common frog) embryos. They found
  that exposing the embryos to a 25% cane sugar solution led to various abnormalities,
  such as short bodies, swollen abdomens, and enlarged mouth cavities. These findings
  support previous research suggesting that osmotic pressure from the sugar solution
  affects the development of the embryos. The results also show similarities to the
  "fancy" races of goldfish, which may be due to similar injury to growing cells caused
  by toxins in the water.
