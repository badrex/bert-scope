tldr: The author discusses the maintenance of solar energy and the possible mechanisms
  that could explain the continuous supply of heat from the sun despite significant
  energy loss into space. They propose that stellar space is filled with rarefied
  gaseous matter, which could be attracted by planetary bodies and contribute to the
  solar system's energy balance. The author also considers the role of meteorites
  and spectrum analysis in understanding the composition of interplanetary space.
