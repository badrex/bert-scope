tldr: 'The authors investigated the role of perceptual grouping in modulation discrimination
  interference (MDI), a phenomenon where the ability to detect changes in modulation
  patterns of sounds is affected by the presence of other modulated sounds. They found
  that two factors contribute to MDI: difficulty in hearing a pitch corresponding
  to the target frequency, which is strongly affected by perceptual grouping, and
  a specific difficulty in hearing the modulation of the target, or distinguishing
  it from the modulation of other sounds present. The results suggest that perceptual
  grouping plays a significant role in MDI.'
