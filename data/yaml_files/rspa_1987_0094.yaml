tldr: This article investigates the electrochemical arc machining (ECAM) process,
  which combines features of electrochemical and electrodischarge machining. The authors
  analyze the stochastic nature of ECAM, focusing on the mechanisms of electrochemical
  dissolution and electrodischarge erosion. They use stochastic models to describe
  the process and interpret the model parameters to better understand the behavior
  of ECAM. The study provides insights into the effects of various machining process
  variables on the type, intensity, and duration of the resulting phases.
