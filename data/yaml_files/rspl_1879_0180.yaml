tldr: The author describes their successful experiments in creating a diamond-like
  carbon, which is as hard as natural diamond and does not affect polarized light.
  They also mention obtaining crystals with curved faces belonging to the octahedral
  form, a unique characteristic shared only with diamond. The specific gravity of
  the created diamond ranges as high as 3.5.
