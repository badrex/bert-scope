tldr: This article discusses the observations of ultraviolet spectra of stars Velorum
  and Puppis using a Skylark rocket. The observations provide information about the
  composition and properties of the interstellar gas in the line of sight and useful
  data on stellar atmospheres. The authors analyze the interstellar absorption lines
  and discuss the implications of their findings on the understanding of the interstellar
  medium and stellar properties.
