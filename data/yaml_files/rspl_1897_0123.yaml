tldr: The authors conducted a comparative study of the suprarenal capsules in teleostean
  fishes and found that they do not contain the medullary portion, which is present
  in higher vertebrates. The study also showed that the known suprarenal bodies of
  teleostean fishes resemble the inter-renal body of elasmobranchs and the cortical
  portion of the suprarenal capsules of higher vertebrates. This research supports
  the idea that the suprarenal gland in teleostean fishes consists entirely of cortex.
