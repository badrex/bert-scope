tldr: The authors developed two methods to measure the percentage of hemolysis in
  a biological system. The first method uses a radiometer to detect changes in light
  transmission through a cell suspension, while the second method employs a selenium
  cell to measure changes in conductivity. These methods allow for the study of hemolysis
  and the effects of lysins, inhibitors, and accelerators on the process. The authors
  also discuss the advantages and limitations of each method and provide calibration
  curves for their use.
