tldr: This article discusses the influence of gravity on materials processing and
  proposes crystal growth techniques in space. It explains the advantages of space
  processing, such as crucible-free zone melting and the absence of thermal convection,
  and suggests suitable growth techniques and materials for space experiments. The
  knowledge gained from these experiments could help improve crystal growth problems
  on Earth and potentially lead to economic growth in space.
