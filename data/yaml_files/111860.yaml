tldr: The authors conducted research on the chemical composition of narcotine and
  its products of decomposition. They analyzed the narcotine's formula, C22H23NO7,
  and discovered that it contains three atoms of methyl. The authors also studied
  the decomposition of cotarnine and the relationship between meconin, hemipinic acid,
  and opianic acid to narcotine. They found new acids and analyzed their properties,
  hoping to discover the nature of their relationship to each other and to narcotine.
