tldr: This study investigates the high-temperature mechanical properties of AISI 316
  weld metal and how residual elements and additives affect its performance. The research
  compares weld deposits made from basic and rutile coated electrodes, finding that
  deposits from rutile coated electrodes exhibit improved tensile strength and slightly
  reduced ductility. The effects of residual elements like phosphorus and boron on
  tensile and creep properties are also examined, with boron increasing both tensile
  and creep strength while leaving ductility largely unaffected.
