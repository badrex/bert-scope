tldr: The authors developed a new form of direct vision spectroscope with improved
  design and functionality. The instrument features three symmetrically arranged prisms
  that provide better dispersion, definition, and range for observing and analyzing
  light spectra, particularly for rapid and precise observations of celestial objects
  like aurorae and meteors.
