tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of ozone and proposes a new
  reaction mechanism. The author finds that the addition of foreign gases, such as
  nitrogen, increases the rate of reaction by preventing the diffusion of atoms to
  the wall. The results show that the decomposition is not a simple bimolecular reaction,
  and the energy of activation varies with the composition of the ozone-oxygen mixtures.
