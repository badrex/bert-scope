tldr: This article discusses the scattering of fast electrons and cosmic-ray particles,
  focusing on the relativistic effects and the role of shielding and non-electric
  interactions. The author develops a statistical theory based on quantum-mechanical
  collisions to analyze the scattering and its implications for understanding the
  behavior of high-energy particles and their interactions with atomic nuclei.
