tldr: The author, William Huggins, conducted spectroscopic observations of stars,
  nebulae, and the Sun to determine their motion relative to Earth. He found that
  the spectra of about one-third of the examined nebulae contained bright lines, and
  the coincidence of these lines with hydrogen and nitrogen lines remained consistent.
  Huggins also observed the Sun's spectrum and found that the red prominences did
  not produce a spectrum of bright lines. His observations on Sirius indicated a motion
  of recession of 41.4 miles per second, while the Sun's spectrum showed an increase
  in the width of most dark lines.
