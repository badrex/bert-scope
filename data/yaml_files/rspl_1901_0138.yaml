tldr: The author, David Bruce, reports on the discovery of a new species of Trypanosoma
  in South Africa by Dr. A. Theiler. This new species is larger than other known Trypanosomas
  and only infects cattle. Dr. Theiler describes the disease as an acute pernicious
  anemia with grave blood changes and proposes that it is the same as bovine malaria.
  The author suggests naming the new Trypanosoma species Trypanosoma Theileri in honor
  of its discoverer.
