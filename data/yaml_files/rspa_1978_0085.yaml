tldr: The authors conducted photoelectric intensity measurements on the CN violet
  band system and interpreted the results through detailed comparison with computer-synthesized
  spectra. They determined transition probability parameters and placed them on an
  absolute scale, providing valuable data for astrophysical applications and understanding
  the behavior of diatomic molecules.
