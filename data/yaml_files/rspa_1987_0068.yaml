tldr: The author reevaluates the condensation coefficient in dropwise condensation
  of steam, taking into account the polyatomicity of water molecules. They find an
  upper limit for the condensation coefficient to be 0.93, rather than the previously
  reported 0.6. The author concludes that, considering the approximate nature of the
  polyatomicity correction and uncertainties in the general theory of dropwise condensation,
  the data do not conclusively show that the condensation coefficient is less than
  unity.
