tldr: The authors conducted experiments using Raman spectroscopy to study the relative
  intensities of the totally symmetrical vibrations in the vapour state of tetramethyls
  of carbon, silicon, germanium, tin, and lead. They found that the intensity of a
  specific mode, consisting mainly of symmetrical methyl deformation, increases as
  the central carbon atom is replaced by other elements in the periodic table. This
  observation supports Wolkenstein's assumption that the polarizability of a bond
  is not affected by changes in orientation.
