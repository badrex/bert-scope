tldr: The authors establish a one-to-one correspondence between true and formal solutions
  of a class of first and second-order differential equations using uniform optimal
  asymptotic inequalities. They also explore the connection between optimal asymptoticity
  and the method of truncation near the least term, and discuss the possibility of
  extending their results to more general systems of differential equations.
