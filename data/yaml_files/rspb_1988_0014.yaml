tldr: The authors studied the ionic currents of smooth muscle cells isolated from
  the ctenophore Mnemiopsis. They identified six separate ionic currents, which are
  similar to currents found in vertebrate smooth and cardiac muscle preparations.
  These findings provide a detailed description of ionic currents in excitable cells
  from coelenterates and help in understanding their role in regulating cell contraction.
