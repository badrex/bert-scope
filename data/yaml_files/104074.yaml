tldr: The author explains a mechanical paradox where two equal weights on a balance
  do not lose equilibrium when one weight is moved farther from the center and the
  other closer. The author demonstrates that the acting force of the weights is proportional
  to their true velocities, which are their perpendicular ascents or descents. This
  understanding helps to improve balance design and disprove the search for perpetual
  motion.
