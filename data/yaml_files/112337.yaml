tldr: The author, Balfour Stewart, conducted experiments to determine the change in
  the elastic force of dry atmospheric air between 32°F and 212°F. He also investigated
  the temperature of the freezing point of mercury. The results showed a slightly
  different coefficient of increase of elasticity of air compared to Regnault's findings.
  Additionally, Stewart discovered that the temperature of the freezing point of mercury
  remains constant, with a difference in readings between an air-thermometer and a
  standard mercurial thermometer due to an anomalous contraction of mercury before
  freezing.
