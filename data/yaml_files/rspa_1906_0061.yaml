tldr: The authors investigated the influence of electric fields on spectral lines
  using an interferometer and an echelon spectroscope. They found that the passage
  of Rontgen rays did not alter the wavelengths of the mercury lines, and that the
  luminous particles did not acquire a significant velocity in the direction of the
  discharge. The experiments showed that any electrical analogue of the Zeeman effect
  was largely masked by the widening of the lines.
