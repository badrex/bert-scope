tldr: The authors studied the de Haas-van Alphen effect in lead single crystals to
  determine the shape of the Fermi surface. They found that the Fermi surface consists
  of several pieces, including a sphere, holes in the second zone, a multiply connected
  surface containing electrons in the third zone, and six 'cushion-shaped' surfaces
  containing electrons in the fourth zone. The study also provided information about
  the electronic specific heat constant and the density of states energy curve.
