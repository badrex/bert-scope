tldr: This article discusses the subcellular and macromolecular aspects of synaptic
  transmission in the adrenal medulla. It focuses on chromogranin A, dopamine β-hydroxylase,
  and the secretion process. The authors provide insights into the storage vesicles,
  proteins, and enzymes involved in the release of catecholamines in response to neural
  stimulation, offering a model for neurotransmitter release at synapses.
