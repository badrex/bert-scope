tldr: The author, Mr. Leeuwenhoek, observed the structure and properties of fat particles
  using a microscope. He discovered that fat particles have a complex internal structure,
  with numerous small cells enclosed within a membrane. The author also found that
  fat particles can change shape and size depending on the conditions, and that they
  have a unique dent or pinch in them. These observations led him to believe that
  fat particles may be separated from their membranes without breaking them.
