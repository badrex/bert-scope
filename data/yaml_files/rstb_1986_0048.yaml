tldr: The article discusses the Rubisco large subunit binding protein, which helps
  in the assembly of the Rubisco enzyme in plants. The protein binds to newly synthesized
  large subunits and ensures their correct interaction with small subunits. The binding
  protein is an oligomer of two types of subunits, alpha and beta, and is synthesized
  by cytoplasmic ribosomes. It is found in various plant plastids containing Rubisco.
