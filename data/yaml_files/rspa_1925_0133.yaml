tldr: This article presents a study on the variation of the electron's mass with velocity
  using homogeneous beta-rays. The authors conducted experiments with electric and
  magnetic fields to measure the change in the electron's mass and found that the
  mass increases with velocity, confirming the theory of relativity.
