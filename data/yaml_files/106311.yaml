tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, Sir William Hamilton describes his observations
  of volcanic traces and geological formations along the banks of the Rhine River.
  He notes the presence of basaltic columns, tuffa, and lava, and suggests that these
  materials originated from subterranean fires. Hamilton also mentions the use of
  these volcanic materials in construction and the trade of tuffa with the Netherlands.
