tldr: The authors improve Feynman's wave function for elementary excitations in superfluid
  helium, known as rotons, by constructing better wave functions that reproduce Landau's
  excitation spectrum more closely. They apply the variational principle and use the
  Tamm-Dancoff approximation to find the self-energy correction for an excitation.
  The results show a roton self-energy correction of about the magnitude required
  by Landau's spectrum.
