tldr: This article explores the role of nonlinear critical layers in boundary layer
  transition, focusing on the interaction between pairs of oblique instability modes.
  The author uses asymptotic methods to describe the nonlinear self-interaction within
  critical layers and discusses the physical implications of the resulting integro-differential
  equations. The study provides insights into the complex phenomena of boundary layer
  transition and the development of turbulence in fluid flows.
