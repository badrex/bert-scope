tldr: A study of iron and aluminium alloys reveals that they cannot be considered
  as simple solid solutions. Instead, they exhibit interesting features in lattice
  spacings and atomic distribution. A superlattice forms in certain ranges, with aluminium
  atoms segregating into definite positions. This study provides a detailed quantitative
  analysis of these lines and sheds light on the stages by which the superlattice
  is built up.
