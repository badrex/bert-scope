tldr: In 1945, the Royal Society elected its first female fellows, Mrs. Kathleen Lonsdale
  and Miss Marjory Stephenson. This marked a significant change in tradition, as the
  society had previously excluded women from fellowship. The admission of women was
  supported by an overwhelming majority of fellows and aligned with the general trend
  of social evolution, demonstrating a commitment to gender equality in the pursuit
  of natural knowledge.
