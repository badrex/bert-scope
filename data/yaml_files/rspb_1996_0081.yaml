tldr: The study found that asymmetric male threespine sticklebacks had more fry in
  their nests than symmetric males, suggesting that they were more reproductively
  successful. This finding contradicts the common belief that symmetric individuals
  have superior fitness. The researchers believe that asymmetric males may be slightly
  larger than symmetric males, but plate number symmetry is unlikely to be assessed
  by potential mates or rival males in this species.
