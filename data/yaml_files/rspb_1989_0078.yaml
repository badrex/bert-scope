tldr: This study examines the morphology and crystallography of strontium sulphate
  crystals found in the colonial radiolarian Sphaerozoum punctatum. The crystals have
  a unique elongated square prism shape with triangular end faces. The researchers
  found that crystal growth is not simple equilibrium growth, and preferential growth
  along the crystallographic a-axis leads to crystal elongation. The study provides
  insights into the factors that control crystal morphology in biological species
  and the possible functions of these crystals in radiolarian development.
