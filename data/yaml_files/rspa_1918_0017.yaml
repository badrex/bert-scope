tldr: This article presents a graphical method for solving high-angle fire problems
  in artillery. The method accounts for the variation in air density and resistance,
  allowing for the determination of projectile trajectories. The process involves
  using five curves and a series of constructions to find the desired values. This
  method provides a practical and efficient way to solve complex problems in ballistics.
