tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of the band spectrum
  of helium. They discovered that certain bands in the spectrum can be selectively
  enhanced by varying the discharge conditions, such as using high-frequency oscillations
  or a specific type of discharge tube. This finding suggests that the helium band
  spectrum may consist of two separate systems, with the relative intensities controlled
  by the discharge conditions.
