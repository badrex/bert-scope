tldr: The author discusses the evolution of a star's spectrum from a nebula, explaining
  how the density, temperature, and mingling of stellar gases change over time. They
  also explore the role of convection currents, pressure, and gravity in shaping a
  star's spectrum. The study of sunspots and their spectra provides insight into the
  solar photosphere and the behavior of elements within a star.
