tldr: This article investigates the dependence of the penetration depth in superconducting
  tin on the strength of the applied magnetic field using the high-frequency technique.
  The authors found that the variation of penetration depth is considerably smaller
  than expected, suggesting the existence of long-range order in the superconducting
  state.
