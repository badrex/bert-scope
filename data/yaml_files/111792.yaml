tldr: The author studied the anatomy and behavior of Macgillivraya, Cheletropis, and
  related genera of pelagic Gasteropoda. They observed that the ciliated arms, initially
  thought to be branchiae, are used for prehension and auxiliary natation. The respiratory
  siphon is a process of the mantle, and the author discovered six arms in a single
  genus. The animals exhibit sensitivity and rapid movements, using their complex
  foot for defense and locomotion. The paper includes descriptions of various species
  and their shells, as well as illustrations of the objects discussed.
