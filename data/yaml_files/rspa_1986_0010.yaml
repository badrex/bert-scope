tldr: The article discusses electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) measurements of
  thulium (Tm) ions in dilute lanthanum nicotinate dihydrate (LaND) crystals. The
  EPR spectra show hyperfine structure and can be fitted using spin Hamiltonian parameters.
  The results suggest that the spectra are attributed to nearest-neighbour pairs of
  ions with nearly degenerate ground states. The transition mechanism is driven by
  the component of the microwave magnetic field parallel to the principal axis of
  the matrix.
