tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the presence or absence of
  boron in the nutrient medium and the development, structure, and functioning of
  nodules on Vicia faba plants. The research shows that the absence of boron leads
  to smaller and less developed nodules, while the presence of boron promotes healthy
  nodule growth. The findings suggest that boron plays a crucial role in plant growth
  and nodule development, and it may be beneficial for the entry of the nodule organism
  into the plant tissues.
