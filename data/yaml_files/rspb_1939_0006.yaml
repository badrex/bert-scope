tldr: The authors conducted micrurgical studies on virus-infected plant cells using
  specially shaped needles. They discovered that virus inclusions can be removed intact
  from infected cells by using a suitable mounting medium with the right osmotic pressure.
  The study also found that virus content in the cells is not confined to inclusions,
  but is also dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The authors also examined the properties
  of infected cells, including their virus content, and the stability of virus inclusions
  in different media.
