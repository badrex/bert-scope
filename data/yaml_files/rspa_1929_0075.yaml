tldr: The author discusses the problem of the transmission and reflection of electric
  waves when the surface separating two media is a sphere. They consider a simple
  oscillator inside the sphere as the source of the waves and analyze the magnetic
  force at various points. The study focuses on the total reflection of electric waves
  and the conditions under which it occurs.
