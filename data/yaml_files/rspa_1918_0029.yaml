tldr: The author conducted an experiment to study the scattering of light by dust-free
  air and observed a blue track along the beam, which was visible even without dust
  particles. The experiment proved that the scattering was not due to dust but a property
  of pure air, and its intensity was of the expected order of magnitude. The author
  also ruled out the possibility of fluorescence by performing a spectroscopic examination
  of the scattered light.
