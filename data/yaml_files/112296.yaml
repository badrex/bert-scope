tldr: This article presents a simple formula and practical rule for calculating heights
  barometrically without logarithms. The formula and table can be used to determine
  heights accurately up to 30,000 feet. The author also provides a simplified rule
  for calculating British heights and discusses the accuracy of the formula in comparison
  to Laplace's formula.
