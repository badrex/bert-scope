tldr: The study examines the orientation discrimination abilities of a patient, GY,
  who has an extensive lesion involving the left striate and prestriate cortex. The
  patient can identify the orientation of a flickering bar but struggles with orientation
  identification for edges formed by color contrast, moving stimuli, or flicker contrast.
  The results suggest that in the absence of striate cortical input, the residual
  mechanisms for color, flicker, or movement do not efficiently support orientation
  detection and discrimination.
