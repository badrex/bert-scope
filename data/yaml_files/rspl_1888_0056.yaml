tldr: The author presents a new form of eudiometer that is accurate, simple, and easy
  to use for oxygen estimation and atmospheric analysis. The eudiometer allows for
  easy introduction of air, mixing with hydrogen gas, and accurate readings. It can
  also be used in conjunction with Pettenkofer's method for carbonic acid determination
  in atmospheric air.
