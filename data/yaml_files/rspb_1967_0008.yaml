tldr: The authors discovered that applying a hyperpolarizing or depolarizing pulse
  to a motor nerve ending during the falling phase of its action potential can suppress
  or potentiate transmitter release, respectively. They also found that the facilitating
  action of calcium on transmitter release can be studied by synchronizing the arrival
  of the nerve impulse with a rapid increment of the external calcium concentration.
  This research provides insights into the complex interactions between electrical
  signals and neurotransmitter release in nerve cells.
