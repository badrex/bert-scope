tldr: The authors studied the effect of radial expansion on the velocity of detonation
  in solid explosives. They found that the detonation velocity depends on the diameter
  of the charge and the degree of radial expansion within the reaction zone. This
  effect can be used to determine the rate of the chemical reaction occurring in the
  detonation wave, providing valuable information about the decomposition of explosives
  and the release of chemical energy.
