tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the effects of sodium nitrate on
  nodule growth and structure in lucerne plants. They found that the presence of nitrate
  in the agar reduced the number and size of nodules, affecting root infection and
  nodule growth. The study provides insights into the complex relationship between
  nitrate supply, root-hair growth, and nodule development in legume plants.
