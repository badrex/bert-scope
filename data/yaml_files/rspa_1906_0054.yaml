  and Current Densities'

semantic_tags:

tldr: This article investigates the effects of self-induction in iron cylinders when
  electric currents are reversed and maintained steady. The author examines the magnetic
  fields and current densities within the cylinder using exploring coils and analyzes
  the results to understand the behavior of the magnetic force and the electric resistance
  in the iron cylinder. The study has implications for the use of alternating currents
  in electrical engineering and the design of railway rails.
