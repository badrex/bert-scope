tldr: William Rowan Hamilton's essay introduces the concept of the Principal Function,
  a transformation that simplifies the study of dynamics. The essay demonstrates the
  application of this function in problems of perturbation, including the motion of
  projectiles and ternary systems. Hamilton's method combines the principles of variations
  and partial differentials, potentially forming a separate branch of analysis called
  the Calculus of Principal Functions.
