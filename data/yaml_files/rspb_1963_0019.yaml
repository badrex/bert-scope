tldr: The authors conducted a theoretical and comparative study on the functional
  dependence of the semicircular canal on its physical dimensions. They found that
  the dimensions of the canal are closely related to animal mass and shape, and their
  findings support Steinhausen's concept of the physical mechanism of the semicircular
  canal. The study provides insights into the physiological response to rotational
  movements in different animals.
