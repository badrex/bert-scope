tldr: The authors investigated the biological effects of homogeneous X-radiation on
  tissue growth and vitality using the chorio-allantoic membrane of the embryo chick.
  They discovered a selective action by different X-ray wavelengths, causing either
  hypertrophic or atrophic reactions in the tissue. This study provides insights into
  the potential applications of X-rays in cancer research and treatment.
