tldr: The author conducted experiments on grafting trees to determine the factors
  affecting their health and fruit production. They found that the health of the parent
  stock plays a significant role in the success of grafting and the growth of the
  new tree. The author also observed that trees propagated from seeds tend to have
  better health and growth than those propagated from cuttings or layers. This research
  can help improve fruit tree cultivation and increase the success rate of grafting.
