tldr: The authors developed synthetic macrocyclic receptors for peptides that exhibit
  high enantioselective binding. They synthesized and studied macrocyclic receptors,
  such as macrotricyclic host 1, which showed enantioselective binding of 90-99% for
  simple peptides. The receptors' binding properties were evaluated through titrations
  and nmr monitoring, revealing three classes of simple peptides with enantioselectivity
  exceeding 1 kcal/mol. The authors also discussed the binding motifs and structures
  of the complexes, suggesting that complexation is driven by the formation of intermolecular
  hydrogen bonds.
