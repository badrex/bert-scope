tldr: Researchers analyzed the oscillations in the orbital eccentricity of 14 satellites
  to evaluate the odd zonal harmonics in Earth's gravitational potential. They found
  the best representation of these harmonics using 7 or 10 coefficients and provided
  values for these coefficients. This study improved the understanding of Earth's
  gravitational field and its variations with latitude.
