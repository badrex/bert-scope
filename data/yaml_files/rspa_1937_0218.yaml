tldr: This article explores the phenomenon of spontaneous emulsification, where oil
  and water mixtures form emulsions without external intervention. The authors discuss
  the role of molecular diffusion, surface tension, and the factors that influence
  the formation and stability of emulsions. They also examine the role of preformed
  soap in stabilizing emulsions and the potential for other substances to act as anti-emulsifiers.
