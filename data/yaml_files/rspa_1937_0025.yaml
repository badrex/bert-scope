tldr: The authors prove the Lorentz invariance of the commutation rules in quantum
  electrodynamics. They consider infinitesimally small Lorentz transformations and
  show that the transformation rules for the fundamental field vectors are valid for
  both finite and infinitesimal transformations due to the group character of Lorentz
  transformations.
