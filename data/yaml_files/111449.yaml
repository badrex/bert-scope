tldr: The author, Augustus Matthiessen, conducted experiments to determine the electric-conducting
  power of various metals at different temperatures. He used a method described in
  the 'Philosophical Magazine' to obtain wires of metals from the alkalies and alkaline
  earths. Matthiessen also investigated the thermo-electric series and the electromotive
  powers of thermo-elements formed from different metals.
