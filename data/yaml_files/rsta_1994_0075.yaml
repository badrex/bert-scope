tldr: This article explores the effects of inhomogeneities on scroll wave dynamics
  in three-dimensional excitable media. The authors focus on the dynamics of scroll
  waves with initially rectilinear filaments evolving in the presence of linear parameter
  gradients with different orientations relative to the filament. They describe how
  the presence of localized defects affects the evolution of these scroll waves, which
  is important for understanding the mechanism of termination and stabilization of
  cardiac arrhythmias.
