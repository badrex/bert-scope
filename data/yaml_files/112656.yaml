tldr: This paper by Henry J. Stephen Smith further develops Eisenstein's theory on
  ternary quadratic forms, discussing the classification of forms based on their discriminant
  and the introduction of a new generic character. It also explores the transformation
  of forms through substitutions and the weight of classes, orders, and representations
  in definite and positive forms. The paper provides methods for determining the weight
  of binary classes of certain series of negative determinants.
