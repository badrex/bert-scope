tldr: Edward Sabine conducted an experiment to measure the temperature at considerable
  depths in the Caribbean Sea. He used a self-registering thermometer enclosed in
  an iron cylinder to avoid any external influences. The experiment showed a significant
  decrease in temperature as the depth increased, with the surface water temperature
  being around 82°F to 83°F, while the temperature at a depth of over 1,000 fathoms
  was around 45°F. This study provides valuable information on the temperature variations
  in the deep sea and the potential effects of heat on water density.
