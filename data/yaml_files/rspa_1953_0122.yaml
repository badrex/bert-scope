tldr: The article discusses recent laboratory measurements on the motions of slow
  electrons in air, suggesting alternative developments in the theory of radio wave
  interaction. The existing theory, based on the relationship between the collisional
  frequency and power supplied by the disturbing wave, is questioned, and a new formulation
  is presented. This new approach predicts the same formal dependence of the absorption
  coefficient on the parameters but with different values, leading to inconsistencies
  between laboratory and ionospheric behavior.
