tldr: This article discusses the structure and development of bone, focusing on the
  Haversian system and the process of bone tissue regeneration. The authors describe
  the different types of canals and spaces in bones, as well as the lamination and
  laminae found in bone tissue. They also explain how older bone tissue is removed
  and replaced with new tissue, demonstrating the continuous process of bone regeneration
  throughout an individual's life.
