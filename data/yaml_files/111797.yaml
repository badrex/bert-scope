tldr: The author conducted experiments on metallic and other oxides to study their
  catalytic properties in maintaining combustion of various gases and vapors. They
  found that sesquioxides, particularly iron oxide, have the strongest tendency to
  produce and maintain the catalytic glow. The author also discussed the implications
  of these findings on the atomic hypothesis and the possibility of tracing some instances
  of "spontaneous combustion" to the catalytic action of iron sesquioxides.
