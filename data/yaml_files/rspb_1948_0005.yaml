tldr: The author discusses various mechanisms of plant resistance to viral infections,
  including immunity, acquired resistance, and tolerance. They explain how plants
  can develop resistance through different reactions to virus strains and how these
  mechanisms can vary depending on the host plant's physiology and environmental conditions.
