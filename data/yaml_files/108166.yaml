tldr: The author discovered a new equiatomic compound of bicyanide with binoxide of
  mercury and studied its properties. The compound is sparingly soluble in cold water,
  has a strong alkaline reaction, and can be decomposed by heat or exposure to nitric
  acid. The author also investigated its reactions with other chemicals, such as ammonia,
  potassium chloride, and potassium iodide, and observed the formation of various
  compounds and crystals.
