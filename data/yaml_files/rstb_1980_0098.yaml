- Energy conservation efficiency
tldr: This article discusses the various routes by which bacteria derive energy, focusing
  on substrate level phosphorylation and oxidative phosphorylation. It also explores
  the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which explains how electron transport-dependent reactions
  drive ATP synthesis. The article highlights the importance of understanding microbial
  energetics for predicting growth yields and manipulating energy conversion efficiency
  in bacteria.
