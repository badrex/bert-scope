tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, discovered a new class of diatomic bodies called
  phosphammonium-compounds. These compounds are formed by the reaction of phosphorus
  and nitrogen-based molecules. The author established the transformation of monatomic
  into diatomic compounds and demonstrated the diatomic nature of these new compounds
  through various experiments and reactions.
