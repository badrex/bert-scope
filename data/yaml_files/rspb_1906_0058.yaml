tldr: The author conducted breeding experiments with the rotifer Hydatina to study
  sex determination. They found that neither temperature nor nutrition played a significant
  role in the varying proportion of arrenotokous and thelytokous offspring. Instead,
  the author suggests that it may be the property of certain individuals to produce
  a specific ratio of offspring, and that external factors do not influence sex determination
  in this species.
