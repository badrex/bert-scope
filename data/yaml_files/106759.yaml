tldr: The author investigates the rotatory motion of a body of any form revolving
  around any axis passing through its center of gravity. The study extends to various
  shapes, including irregular ones, and provides a theoretical framework for understanding
  the angular velocity and momentum of rotating bodies. The findings have implications
  for astronomy and celestial mechanics.
