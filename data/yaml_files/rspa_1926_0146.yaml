tldr: This study investigates the longitudinal magneto-resistance effect in single
  crystals of iron and its relationship with crystal structure. The research finds
  that the crystal structure significantly affects the magnitude of the resistance
  change, but no change of sign of the phenomenon is observed. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of the relationship between magneto-resistance and crystal
  structure in iron.
