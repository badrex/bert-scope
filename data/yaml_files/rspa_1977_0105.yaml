tldr: In 1974, the discovery of new heavy particles with long lifetimes revolutionized
  the field of elementary particle physics. This article discusses the discovery of
  these particles, their properties, and the implications for our understanding of
  weak interactions and quantum numbers. The discovery of the vJ particles and their
  family members opened up new domains in hadronic and possibly leptonic physics,
  leading to further research and the exploration of theoretical ideas unifying weak
  and electromagnetic interactions.
