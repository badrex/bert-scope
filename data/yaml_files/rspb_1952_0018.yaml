tldr: The authors discovered that administering sulphadimidine, a pyrimidine derivative,
  to young cockerels induces testicular hypertrophy. This effect appears to be independent
  of the drug's bacteriostatic action and is not neutralized by p-aminobenzoic acid
  or folic acid. The study also found that substances effective in causing testicular
  hypertrophy, such as sulphadimidine, inhibit blood clotting, but the testicular
  effect is independent of the effect on blood clotting.
