tldr: The authors explore two models of partially focused clear zone compound eyes,
  analyzing the optics and admittance functions. They demonstrate how the distribution
  of light from the cone tips and the angle of incidence on the facets affect the
  eye's focusing capabilities and angular sensitivity. This research contributes to
  understanding the visual acuity and sensitivity of insects with partially focused
  clear zone eyes.
