tldr: This paper explores the properties and design considerations of Wildhaber-Novikov
  circular arc gears, focusing on their sensitivity to changes in centers distance,
  the compromise between sensitivity and contact stress, and the extent of the contact
  area. The authors provide a rigorous analysis of the gears' geometry and kinematics,
  considering variations on the basic design and operation under different conditions
  than those for which the gears were originally designed.
