tldr: The author presents an analytical approach to Steiner's extension of Malfatti's
  problem, which involves describing three circles within a triangle that touch each
  other and two sides of the triangle. The author provides a detailed analysis of
  the problem, including geometric constructions and analytical developments, leading
  to a solution for the problem.
