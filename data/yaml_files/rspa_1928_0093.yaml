tldr: The authors present a new method for measuring the surface area of film catalysts
  using interference. They explain how interference colors in oxide films can be used
  to determine film thickness, which in turn can be used to calculate surface area.
  This method is particularly useful for studying the catalytic properties of supported
  catalysts.
