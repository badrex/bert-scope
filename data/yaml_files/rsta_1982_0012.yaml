tldr: The article discusses the inverse problem for vibrating beams in the free-clamped
  configuration. The author reconstructs the flexural rigidity and density functions
  of the beam from data associated with natural frequencies of vibration. The study
  focuses on the unique non-singular beam without a back and presents a method to
  construct the beam using auxiliary equations and fundamental solutions.
