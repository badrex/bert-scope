  of Light

tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of a refracting medium
  on the amount of astronomical aberration of light. They designed a telescope filled
  with water to test the theory and found that the true aberration was the same as
  the received aberration, supporting the Undulatory Theory of Light.
