tldr: This article reviews the experiments and results of neutrino oscillation searches
  at high-energy accelerators. Two methods, disappearance and appearance, are discussed,
  along with their advantages and limitations. The article presents recent experimental
  results and exclusion plots, concluding that the mixing parameter limit should be
  further reduced to explore the possibility of neutrinos being dark matter candidates.
