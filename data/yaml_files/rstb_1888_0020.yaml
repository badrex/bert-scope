tldr: The author examines the electric organ of the skate, specifically Raia radiata,
  and describes its structure and development. The organ is relatively small and less
  highly developed than those of other skate species. The author also discusses the
  differences in the size, shape, and structure of the electric cups and the surrounding
  tissues in Raia radiata compared to other species.
