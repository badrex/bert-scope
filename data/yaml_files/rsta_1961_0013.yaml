tldr: This article describes a precise method for measuring the density of mercury
  at 20°C using a hollow cube of fused silica. The researchers found that the largest
  source of uncertainty in previous measurements was the thickness of grease films
  on the surfaces of the cubes. They developed a new method to minimize these uncertainties
  and obtained a more accurate density value for mercury.
