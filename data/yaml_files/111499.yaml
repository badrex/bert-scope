tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, investigates the properties and reactions of carbanilide
  and sulphocarbanilide, two compounds derived from ammonia. He discovers cyanate
  of phenyl and sulphocyanide of phenyl through various chemical reactions and examines
  their characteristics and reactions with other substances. This research contributes
  to the understanding of diamides and their applications in organic chemistry.
