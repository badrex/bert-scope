tldr: This article describes a lightning strike at Steeple Ashton and Holt in 1772,
  which caused damage to a house and its occupants. The authors emphasize the danger
  of placing iron in the upper part of chimneys without a conductor to protect against
  lightning strikes. The incident supports the idea that iron can conduct electricity
  and cause significant harm.
