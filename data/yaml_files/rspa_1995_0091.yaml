tldr: The author presents a more efficient method for calculating wave loads on offshore
  structures using a slender-body approach. This method can handle complex structures
  with non-circular cross-sections, joints, and surface intersections. The author
  also discusses the limitations of the theory and provides a general result for the
  overall global load on a moving structure.
