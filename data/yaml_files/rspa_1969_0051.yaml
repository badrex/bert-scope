tldr: This article presents a modified Taylor's criterion for selecting the combination
  of slip and twinning systems in constrained deformation of face-centered cubic (f.c.c.)
  metals. The authors analyze the problem of accommodation of constrained deformation
  by slip and twinning, considering both slip and twinning as deformation mechanisms.
  They provide detailed calculations for f.c.c. crystals deformed by plane strain
  compression and compare their results with experimental observations on deformed
  single crystals of a Co-8% Fe alloy. The study has implications for understanding
  the deformation behavior of f.c.c. metals and the role of mechanical twinning in
  their deformation process.
