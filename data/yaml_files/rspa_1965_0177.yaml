tldr: This article investigates the effects of size and shape on the fracture of liquids
  in shear using a cone-and-plate viscometer. The authors demonstrate that the critical
  stress for fracture increases with decreasing cone angle and cone radius, and with
  increasing volume of the meniscus of excess liquid surrounding the periphery of
  the cone. The findings have implications for understanding and predicting the behavior
  of liquids in various shearing devices, including extruders.
