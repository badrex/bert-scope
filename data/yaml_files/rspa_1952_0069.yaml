tldr: The authors developed a new technique to study the moisture relations of textile
  fibres at high humidities. They found that textile fibres have a high sorption capacity
  for moisture at high humidities, and the immediate saturation regain is close to
  the moisture imbibition obtained from standard centrifuging. The previous methods
  of measurement yielded low values of saturation regain due to unfavorable conditions
  for mass transfer and inadequate temperature control. The hysteresis loop is concluded
  to close at saturation.
