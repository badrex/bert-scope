tldr: Dietrich Kuchemann was a German scientist who made significant contributions
  to the field of aerodynamics and propulsion. He studied under notable professors
  and worked at the Aerodynamische Versuchs Anstalt (A.V.A.) in Gottingen. Kuchemann's
  research focused on air intakes, annular aerofoils, and jet propulsion units, which
  led to the publication of the book "Aerodynamics of Propulsion." He also worked
  with Dr. Johanna Weber, forming a fruitful partnership. Kuchemann's life and work
  are a testament to his dedication to science and his ability to navigate challenging
  political circumstances.
