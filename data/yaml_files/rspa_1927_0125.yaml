tldr: The authors present a study on the flexure of thin cylindrical shells and other
  "thin" sections, providing corrections to St. Venant's theory of flexure. They introduce
  second-order terms to account for cases where one dimension of the cross-section
  is small compared to others, leading to a new form of instability. The study focuses
  on a thin circular tube subjected to flexure, illustrating the effects of these
  corrections and the potential for maximum bending moments.
