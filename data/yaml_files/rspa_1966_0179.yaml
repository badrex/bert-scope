tldr: This article investigates the effects of compressibility on free convection
  boundary layers, providing a complete formulation and solutions that clarify the
  impact of various parameters. The study demonstrates that previous approaches to
  the free convection problem are limited and that an exact treatment will not produce'similar'
  velocity and temperature distributions. The analysis focuses on two-dimensional
  flow and isothermal vertical plates, considering the effects of compressibility,
  relative temperature difference, and the ratio of specific heats.
