tldr: The author, Thomas Andrews, conducted experiments on carbonic acid to study
  the transition between its gaseous and liquid states. He discovered a critical point
  at 30Â°C where carbonic acid ceases to liquefy by pressure. Andrews found that the
  transition between the gaseous and liquid states can be made continuous, with no
  interruption or breach of continuity. This research sheds light on the continuity
  of matter and the behavior of other substances like nitrous oxide, hydrochloric
  acid, ammonia, and sulfur compounds.
