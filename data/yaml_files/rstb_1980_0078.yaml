tldr: The author discusses the physics of visual perception, focusing on how the human
  visual system processes and interprets different spatial frequencies and contrast
  thresholds. They explain how the visual system organizes itself into channels that
  are sensitive to specific spatial frequencies and orientations, allowing us to perceive
  and understand the world around us. The author also explores the implications of
  this understanding for various real-world scenarios, such as recognizing objects
  in low light conditions or interpreting the visual information from different spatial
  frequencies.
