tldr: The study examines the coordination of movements in the Tasmanian mountain shrimp,
  Anaspides tasmaniae, a primitive crustacean that represents an early branch in crustacean
  evolution. The animal uses its thoracic endopodites and abdominal appendages for
  locomotion and its thoracic exopodites for respiration. The research provides insights
  into the primitive relationship between thorax and abdomen and the development of
  rhythmic systems in crustaceans.
