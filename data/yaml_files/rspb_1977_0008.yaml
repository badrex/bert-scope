tldr: The E.M.I. scanner, a machine that employs computerized tomography, allows for
  the differentiation and measurement of soft tissues' density, overcoming limitations
  of conventional X-ray technology. By scanning through the patient in a transaxial
  plane, the E.M.I. scanner provides a series of tomographic slices, offering a more
  accurate and detailed view of the body's interior, improving diagnosis and disease
  detection.
