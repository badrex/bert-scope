tldr: This article explores the vibrational spectra of spin-degenerate molecules,
  focusing on the Jahn-Teller effect. It develops a physical theory to interpret these
  spectra and discusses the unique features of molecules with spin-degeneracy, such
  as Kramers degenerate molecules and tetrahedral and octahedral molecules in fourfold
  degenerate states. The article provides group-theoretical selection rules for infra-red
  and Raman spectra and considers the impact of vibronic coupling on these molecules.
