tldr: This article investigates the impact of temperature on the refractive index
  and dispersive power of expansible fluids used in telescopes. The author, Peter
  Barlow, examines the changes in the telescope's focal length and the fluid lens's
  position under varying temperatures. He concludes that the changes are small and
  can be easily corrected, making telescopes with fluid lenses suitable for modern
  astronomy.
