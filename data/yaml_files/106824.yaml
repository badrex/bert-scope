tldr: The author conducted astronomical observations on the planets Venus and Mars
  to determine their heliocentric longitude, annual motion of nodes, and the greatest
  inclination of their orbits. The observations were made using a six-feet transit
  instrument and a mural quadrant. The findings were compared with other astronomers'
  observations and tables, providing insights into the accuracy of existing astronomical
  data and calculations.
