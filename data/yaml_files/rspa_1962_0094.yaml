tldr: This article investigates the resistance transitions of thin superconducting
  films in magnetic fields. The experiments were conducted on tin films with thicknesses
  ranging from 600 to 10,000 Angstroms. The results show that the resistance transitions
  in perpendicular magnetic fields are sharp and comparatively insensitive to edge
  effects. The findings indicate that the effective penetration depth and coherence
  distance play a significant role in the behavior of these thin films.
