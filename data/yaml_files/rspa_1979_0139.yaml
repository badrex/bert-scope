tldr: The authors propose a unified nonlinear theory for massless bosons, including
  photons and gravitons, by using a faithful nonlinear realization of the full little
  group over the physically observed helicity states. They construct nonlinear transformation
  laws for the commutator functions and discuss the implications of this theory, including
  the possibility of investigating nonlinear effects with high-intensity lasers or
  intense gravitational fields surrounding dense stars.
