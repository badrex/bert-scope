tldr: The article discusses the resistance of potato tissue to the growth of fungal
  pathogens, particularly Phytophthora infestans. It explores the mechanisms of resistance,
  including the hypersensitive reaction, and the role of phenolic compounds like lignin
  and terpenoid compounds in defending against infection. The study also highlights
  the importance of understanding the interactions between host factors and the growth
  and development of pathogens to improve disease resistance in potato plants.
