tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments on sound transmission in heterogeneous
  atmospheres and artificial fogs. He discovered that sound can pass through the interstices
  of solid bodies as long as the continuity of the air is preserved. Tyndall also
  explored the use of sudden flashes, obtained by combustion or electric lights, as
  fog signals. These findings have implications for firemen's respirators and fog-related
  safety.
