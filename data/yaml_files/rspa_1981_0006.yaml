tldr: This study investigates the impact of hydrostatic pressure on the ductility,
  creep life, and failure mechanism of a 2% Cr 1% Mo steel under different uniaxial
  stresses. The research found that increasing hydrostatic pressure led to increased
  creep ductility and a decrease in cavitation, resulting in a longer time to failure.
  The results are discussed in terms of a diffusional cavity growth model that includes
  continuous nucleation and compared with data from single-phase materials tested
  under similar conditions. The study also examines the role of principal and equivalent
  stresses in the creep fracture of the steel and discusses the estimation of long-term
  creep life from short-term creep tests.
