tldr: This article discusses how environmental and biological constraints, such as
  transmission channel limitations and the need for effective sound localization,
  have shaped the design of long-range signals and the structure of the ear and nervous
  system in acoustic insects. Insects use sound signals for attracting mates and aggressive
  interactions, but the small size and high frequency of their signals lead to excess
  attenuation. Strategies like optimal broadcasting positions and redundancy in song
  elements help counteract these limitations.
