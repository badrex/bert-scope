tldr: The article discusses the development and implementation of the harmonic analyser
  at the meteorological office for the analysis of photographic thermograms and barograms.
  The machine, consisting of disk, globe, and cylinder integrators, was designed to
  determine the mean and coefficients of temperature variations. The harmonic analyser
  significantly improved the efficiency of data analysis, reducing the need for laborious
  measurement and calculation processes.
