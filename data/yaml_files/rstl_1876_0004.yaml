tldr: The author examines the structure and relations of the alcyonarian Heliopora
  Cérulea and a species of Sarcophyton, as well as the structure of Millepora, Pocillopora,
  and Stylaster species. They find that Heliopora is an alcyonarian, which challenges
  previous beliefs about the classification of corals. The study provides insights
  into the anatomy and affinities of these corals, contributing to a better understanding
  of their classification and evolution.
