tldr: This study investigates the effectiveness of using the fungal pathogen Metarhizium
  flavoviride to control locusts and grasshoppers. The research demonstrates that
  secondary cycling of the pathogen after a single spray application provides a biological
  substitute for chemical persistence, making it an effective and environmentally
  friendly alternative to traditional chemical pesticides. The findings have significant
  implications for the economics of biopesticide use in pest control.
