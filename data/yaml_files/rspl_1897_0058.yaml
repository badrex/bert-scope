tldr: This article discusses the author's expedition to Ki√∂ Island to observe the
  total solar eclipse of August 9, 1896. Despite unfavorable weather, the observing
  party managed to make some observations of temperature, colors of the landscape,
  and general phenomena of totality. The author also describes the preparation of
  instruments and huts, as well as the organization of the "Volage" observers into
  different working parties for various tasks. The article highlights the differences
  between the chromospheric and Fraunhofer spectra, and the importance of using prismatic
  cameras, integrating spectroscopes, and other instruments for accurate observations.
