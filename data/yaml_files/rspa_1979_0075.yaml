tldr: This article presents a diffusion model for the propagation of fatigue cracks,
  showing that fatigue crack growth can be described by a transition density function
  and the probability of a fatigue crack reaching a critical size can be determined
  by solving the diffusion equation. The model considers the crack tip position as
  a state variable and demonstrates how the fatigue life of a cracked part is related
  to the transition probability.
