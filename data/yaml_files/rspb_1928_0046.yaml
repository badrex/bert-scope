tldr: The authors conducted a study on the anatomy and phylogeny of Spondylus and
  Pecten, two genera of Lamellibranch mollusks. They found that despite differences
  in shell form, the two genera share similarities in their orientation, adductor
  muscles, and mantle structure. The study also revealed unique features of the nervous
  system in Spondylus, which sets it apart from other Lamellibranchs. The authors
  discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the evolution and relationships
  between these two genera.
