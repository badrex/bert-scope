tldr: This article discusses the optimization of bioactivity in crop protection chemicals
  through the use of quantitative structure-activity relations (QSAR). The authors
  focus on the importance of electronic, hydrophobic, and steric substituent constants
  in modulating bioactivity in a congeneric series. They review the state of the art
  of these parameters and their applications, emphasizing recent developments in steric
  parameters. The article provides examples of QSAR studies on various crop protection
  chemicals, highlighting the significance of lead optimization in the design of these
  chemicals.
