tldr: This article presents a new model for potential flow past slender delta wings
  with leading edge separation. The model introduces a free boundary, a vortex sheet,
  which represents the vortex layer and the core of rotating fluid observed in real
  flow. The shape and strength of the vortex sheet are determined by satisfying boundary
  conditions, such as the sheet being a stream surface and sustaining no pressure
  difference. The model provides a more accurate representation of the observed flow
  pattern in real fluids, improving upon previous theories for the slender delta wing.
