tldr: The author investigates turbulence caused by thermal instability in fluids,
  focusing on the statistical theory and the role of gravity and temperature gradients.
  They develop a closed system of equations for the defining scalars and find that
  there is an exact balance between the dissipation of kinetic energy by viscosity
  and the liberation of potential energy by gravity. The study also reveals that the
  field of turbulence can be analyzed into two modes, with kinetic energy being confined
  primarily to the vertical or horizontal direction.
