tldr: 'This paper discusses the fossil teeth of extinct equine species found in Central
  and South America. The author, Professor Owen, describes and analyzes the teeth
  of three species: Equus conversidens, Equus tau, and Equus arcidens. He compares
  these species to existing horses and other extinct animals, suggesting that they
  may have formed a distinct group within the Equidae family. The paper includes illustrations
  of the specimens described.'
