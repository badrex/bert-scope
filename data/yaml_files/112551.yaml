tldr: This article is a supplementary memoir to the author's previous work on skew
  surfaces, also known as scrolls. It explores the theory of quartic scrolls with
  a directrix skew cubic and a triple directrix line. The author develops a theory
  of the reciprocal relations of these scrolls, which has interesting analytical features.
  The paragraphs in this memoir are numbered consecutively with the previous memoir.
