tldr: This article discusses the evolution of passive continental margins and the
  organic geochemistry of margin sediments. It examines recent deep drilling results,
  focusing on the organic-rich shales and mudstones found in the Tarfaya Basin and
  the north Atlantic Ocean. The authors highlight the significance of these findings
  for understanding hydrocarbon generation and the potential for petroleum generation
  in these areas.
