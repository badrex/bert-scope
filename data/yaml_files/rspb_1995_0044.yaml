tldr: The article investigates the relationship between abscisic acid (ABA) and temperature
  in controlling stomatal movements in plants. It shows that low temperatures reduce
  the stomatal response to ABA, and above 15Â°C, the magnitude of the stomatal response
  to ABA increases with temperature. This suggests that ABA plays a crucial role in
  limiting stomatal opening at high temperatures and allowing opening when temperatures
  are low, facilitating carbon dioxide uptake.
