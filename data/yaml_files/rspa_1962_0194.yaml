tldr: The article presents a model theory for the transport of buoyant fluids in turbulent
  wakes, specifically focusing on methane wakes in coal mines. The theory considers
  the diffusion and convection of methane-air mixtures in the wake of a falling body,
  providing insights into the ignition of methane in coal mines and the potential
  hazards it poses. The model takes into account factors such as Reynolds numbers,
  body shape, and turbulence, and can be applied to various applications involving
  the transport of non-buoyant or buoyant material in turbulent wakes.
