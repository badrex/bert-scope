tldr: This article investigates the dielectric loss mechanism in paraffin wax solutions
  at high radio frequencies. The researchers studied the effect of adding an ester,
  cetyl palmitate, to the paraffin wax and observed that the power factor temperature
  curve passes through a maximum, which is independent of frequency. The results show
  that the dielectric loss increases with the addition of the ester, and the power
  factor values are influenced by the type of paraffin wax medium and the polar molecule
  added.
