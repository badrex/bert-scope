tldr: The authors investigate the structure of the polish layer on metals using electron
  diffraction. They find that the polished surface exhibits a pattern of two diffuse
  haloes, which suggests that the polish layer is "almost amorphous." The authors
  discuss various theories and experiments related to the structure of the polish
  layer and propose a method to further study its properties.
