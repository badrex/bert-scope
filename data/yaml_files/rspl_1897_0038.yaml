tldr: This article presents an experimental study and theoretical analysis of heat
  transmission between metal surfaces and liquids. The authors investigate the rate
  of heat transfer from heated metal surfaces to colder water and vice versa. They
  propose a method to measure the heat transfer rate and discuss the factors affecting
  it, such as the velocity of water flow and the thickness of the water film on the
  metal surface. The results are in accordance with Professor Osborne Reynolds' theory
  of heat convection.
