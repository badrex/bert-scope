tldr: The authors discovered that the drug cyproterone acetate, a gestagen, has powerful
  antiandrogen properties. When administered to pregnant rats, it caused feminization
  in male offspring, leading to a lack of male genitalia and the development of female
  genitalia. This finding led to further research on the hormonal regulation of sex
  differentiation and the potential applications of antiandrogens in medicine.
