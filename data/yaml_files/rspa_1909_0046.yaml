tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the boiling points of various
  metals using a vertical carbon tube resistance furnace. They found that the temperature
  at which vaporization becomes rapid enough to cause a decided projection of drops
  from the surface can be taken as the boiling point. The study involved heating metals
  in a graphite crucible and measuring the temperature of the outer walls using an
  optical pyrometer. The results provide approximate boiling points for several metals.
