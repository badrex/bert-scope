tldr: The authors propose a tectonic model for Afghanistan, suggesting that an Iran-Afghan
  crustal block acts as a buffer between the stable Asian mass, the Indian-Australian
  crustal plate, and the Arabian Peninsula block. They analyze regional seismicity
  data and fault systems to create a seismo-tectonic map, which reveals active faults
  and seismic activity patterns in the country. This model helps explain the dominant
  tectonic processes and seismic activity in Afghanistan.
