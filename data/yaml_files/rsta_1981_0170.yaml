tldr: This article discusses pulse voltammetric methods, including normal and differential
  pulse voltammetry, and their applications in industrial electrochemistry. The techniques
  are presented with equations describing their principles, and various specific applications
  are demonstrated, such as determining trace elements in sewage and the determination
  of sulfide. The article also highlights the advantages of amperometric titrations
  in eliminating background errors and the use of square-wave voltammetry in electrochemical
  high-performance chromatographic detectors for nitrosamine analysis.
