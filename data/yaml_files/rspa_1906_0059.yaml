tldr: This study investigates the periodicity in the yield of wheat in eastern England
  between 1885 and 1905. The author discovers a significant 11-year periodic pattern
  with five harmonic components, which can explain the apparent oscillations in the
  yield. The findings help to understand the relationship between climate, agriculture,
  and crop yields.
