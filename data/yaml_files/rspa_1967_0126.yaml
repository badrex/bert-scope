tldr: The authors explore the nonlinear interactions between planetary waves, which
  are essential for understanding atmospheric and oceanic motions. They study the
  conditions for resonant interactions between these waves and find that the energy
  transfer occurs in the neighborhoods of two critical latitude circles, symmetrically
  north and south of the equator. The analysis allows for a nonzero horizontal divergence
  of the motion and provides insights into the energy exchange between resonant wave
  triplets and continuous spectra.
