tldr: This article discusses the rigidification of behaviour in animals and humans
  during stress situations. It explains how animals in captivity create abnormal rituals
  and motor patterns due to the lack of environmental variability, leading to a simplified
  nervous system response. The author highlights the similarities between these stereotyped
  patterns and animal rituals, and explores the common factors that explain their
  shared properties.
