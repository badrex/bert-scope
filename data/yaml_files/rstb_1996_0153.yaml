tldr: The authors develop a case model to study the persistence mechanisms in the
  interaction between the butterfly Maculinea rebeli and its specialist parasitoid
  Ichneumon eumerus. They explore how parasitoid searching intensity, behavior, and
  host refuges affect the dynamics of the parasitoid-host relationship. The study
  highlights the importance of heterogeneity in vulnerability and intraspecific competition
  within ant nests in the persistence of both host and parasitoid populations.
