tldr: This article presents an overview of recent advancements in heterostructure
  barrier varactors, also known as quantum barrier varactors, for generating power
  at submillimetre-wave frequencies. These devices have several advantages over traditional
  Schottky barrier varactors, including odd harmonic generation, large power handling,
  and large device area at high frequencies. Theoretical design and performance characteristics
  for triplers and quintuplers are discussed, along with an overview of multiplier
  experiments.
