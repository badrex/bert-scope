tldr: The author examines the reptiliferous sandstone of Elgin and its relation to
  the Upper Old Red Sandstone. Through the analysis of fossils found in the area,
  the author concludes that the sandstone is of Triassic age, providing overwhelming
  paleontological evidence to support this claim. The author also discusses the stratigraphical
  evidence and the challenges in correlating the geological age of the formation due
  to the disturbances and limited exposures of the rocks in the district.
