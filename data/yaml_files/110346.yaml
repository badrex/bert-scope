tldr: The author presents the case of Thomas Hardy Kirman, who was born with an unusual
  level of corpulence. The paper discusses the factors contributing to corpulence,
  such as heredity, environmental factors like living in marshy areas, diet, and inactivity.
  Corpulence is observed to be more common in England than in France or the South
  of Europe. The author also mentions the importance of mental factors like tranquillity,
  cheerfulness, and equability of temper in promoting corpulence.
