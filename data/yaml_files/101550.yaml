tldr: The author, Nathaniel Fairfax, shares observations about insects and their inoxiousness
  in a letter to the publisher. He discusses how creatures considered venomous are
  not poisonous when swallowed and provides examples of people who have consumed spiders
  and toads without harm. He also mentions an experiment where a spider changes the
  color of water when bruised, suggesting that insects can have color-changing abilities.
