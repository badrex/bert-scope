tldr: The author examines the role of water in volcanic eruptions and challenges the
  hypothesis that water plays a primary role in the process. They argue that water
  cannot penetrate deep enough into the Earth's crust to cause eruptions and that
  there is no direct relationship between the discharge of lava and steam. The author
  also discusses the impact of volcanic activity on underground water sources and
  the hydrogeological conditions of these waters.
