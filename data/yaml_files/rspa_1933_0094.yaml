tldr: This article investigates the persistence of crystallization nuclei in molten
  metals, specifically bismuth, cadmium, lead, and tin. The experiments reveal a correlation
  between the degree of preheating and subsequent undercooling, with greater preheating
  producing greater undercooling. The study also shows that the time factor has little
  influence on the degree of undercooling, and the results suggest that the process
  of melting and solidification is more complex than previously thought.
