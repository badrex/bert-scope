tldr: Sir G. H. Darwin identifies a mistake in the instructions for using a tidal
  reductions apparatus and provides a corrected method for calculating tidal heights.
  The error is found in the computation forms sold by the Cambridge Scientific Instrument
  Company, and Darwin offers to inform purchasers of the correction.
