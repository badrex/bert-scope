tldr: This article discusses the role of cosmic strings in the early universe and
  their potential to provide the fluctuations that lead to galaxy formation. The authors
  review the theories that predict cosmic strings, their formation conditions, and
  the evolution of the string system. They also present evidence from the correlation
  of clusters and an alternative scenario where lighter strings might dominate the
  recent universe.
