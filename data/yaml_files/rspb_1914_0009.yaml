tldr: The author investigates the effect of substrate and enzyme concentrations on
  the optimum temperature for salicin hydrolysis by sweet-almond emulsin. They find
  that the optimum temperature remains constant, regardless of the substrate and enzyme
  concentrations. This study contributes to understanding enzyme kinetics and the
  factors affecting enzyme activity.
