tldr: The authors introduce a generalized vector analysis in four dimensions, which
  can be applied to various spaces, including Euclidean and non-Euclidean. They use
  Hamilton's quaternion calculus and Gibbs' vector notation to explain the concept
  of vectors and co-vectors in four-dimensional space. This analysis can be used in
  various fields, such as physics and engineering.
