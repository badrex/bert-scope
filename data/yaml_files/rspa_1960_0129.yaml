tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the scattering of 28.5 MeV 3He particles
  and the resulting nuclear reactions. They analyzed the elastic scattering distributions
  using an optical model and found that the 3He nucleus behaves similarly to alpha
  particles. The observed angular distributions confirm that the 3He nucleus has a
  short mean free path in nuclear matter, making the interaction mainly a surface
  effect. The authors also obtained interaction radii from the positions of maxima
  and minima in the scattering patterns.
