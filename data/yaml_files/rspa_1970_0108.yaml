tldr: The article explores the migration of single and multi-solute systems subjected
  to a uniform potential gradient, focusing on the formation of hyperbolic boundaries.
  The authors derive continuity equations for each system and discuss their geometrical
  interpretation. They also examine the effects of composition-dependence of constituent
  mobilities on migration patterns, leading to the classification of boundaries as
  hyperbolic, elliptic, and parabolic types.
