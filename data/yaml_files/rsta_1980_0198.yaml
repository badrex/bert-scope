tldr: The authors describe the separation and distribution of soil samples from different
  depths of a core recovered from the Moon's surface by the Soviet space mission Luna
  24. They divided the samples based on size, visual appearance, density, and magnetic
  properties, and distributed them to various British laboratories for detailed investigations.
  This paper documents the sample processing carried out at Cambridge.
