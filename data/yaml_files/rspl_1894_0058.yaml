tldr: The author studied the nervous system of embryonic lobsters using Ehrlich's
  methylene blue method. They identified and described various types of nerve elements,
  including coordinating, motor, and sensory elements, and their connections within
  the ganglia. This research provides insights into the development and organization
  of the lobster's nervous system.
