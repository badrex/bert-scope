revised_title: Merging and Extending the Miles and Howard Theorems for Gas Flows

- Helical Flows
tldr: The authors present a refinement of Howard's semicircle theorem for plane flows,
  merging it with Miles's theorem. They also provide a restriction on unstable modes
  of a wide class of helical gas flows. This work extends previous theorems and offers
  a compound form that unites the Miles and Howard bounds to the growth rate of instabilities
  in parallel flows.
