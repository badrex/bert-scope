tldr: Mr. Leewenhoeck conducted a series of experiments to study the structure and
  function of the optic nerve. He observed that the nerve's fibers shrink after being
  cut from the eye, revealing a hollow center. By drying and examining the optic nerve,
  he discovered numerous holes resembling a leather sieve. Leewenhoeck concluded that
  the nerve's fibers are made up of soft fluid globules, which are exhaled during
  drying. He proposed a model for how the optic nerve transmits visual information
  to the brain, similar to water in a glass being disturbed by a finger.
