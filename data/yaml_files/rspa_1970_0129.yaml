tldr: The authors studied the morphology of porous anodic films formed on aluminum
  in phosphoric acid electrolytes. They discovered that the steady-state barrier-layer
  thickness, cell diameter, and pore diameter are directly proportional to the formation
  voltage. The mechanism of film formation involves an equilibrium between oxide formation
  in the barrier layer and field-assisted dissolution at the bases, determining the
  cell and pore sizes through a simple geometrical mechanism.
