tldr: The author discovered a unique meiosis process in the mantid species Callimantis
  antillarum, where no chiasmata are formed during meiosis, leading to a reductional
  first meiotic division for all chromosome parts. This is similar to the male Drosophila,
  but with different underlying mechanisms. The mantid has a simple XO sex determination
  in males, which is different from other mantids previously studied.
