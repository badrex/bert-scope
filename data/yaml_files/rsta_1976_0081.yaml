tldr: The article discusses pressure-solution and crystallization deformation in geological
  structures, focusing on the role of diffusion processes in the rearrangement of
  minerals. The author examines the thermodynamics of crystal-solution systems and
  the different types of geological processes involved, such as pressure-solution,
  cavity growth, pressure growth, and solution-transfer. The study aims to provide
  a better understanding of the strains and displacements associated with these processes
  in rocks.
