tldr: The article presents a study on the ionization cross-section of oxygen (O) by
  electron impact. The authors describe the method of calculation, which involves
  the distorted wave method and the Coulomb-Born approximation. They provide tables
  and figures with the results of their calculations, discussing the contributions
  from different total angular momentum and comparing the distorted wave and Coulomb-Born
  methods. The study shows that the cross-section for ionization is influenced by
  the contribution of optical transitions and the ion charge.
