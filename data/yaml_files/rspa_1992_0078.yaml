tldr: The authors developed a unified viscoplasticity model for predicting the deformation
  and lifetimes of structural components under mechanical and cyclic thermal loading.
  They conducted a series of cyclic plasticity tests on cast copper and used computational
  techniques to determine the material parameters for the Chaboche viscoplasticity
  model, which accounts for creep, cyclic plasticity, and damage. This model can be
  used to improve the design of components in the power industry and other high-temperature
  applications.
