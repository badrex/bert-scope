tldr: This study investigates the frictional anisotropy in nonmetallic crystals, such
  as diamond, magnesium oxide, and lithium fluoride, and its relation to crystallographic
  direction and slider shape. The experiments reveal that frictional anisotropy is
  primarily due to anisotropic modes of bulk deformation, which are influenced by
  the crystallographic direction and the shape of the slider. The findings provide
  insights into the mechanisms of deformation and fracture associated with friction
  in nonmetallic crystals.
