tldr: This article presents a perturbation calculation of oscillator strengths in
  the molecular ion HeH. The authors extend their previous calculations to non-diagonal
  elements, providing a high accuracy over a wide range of nuclear separations for
  the direct transition. However, the perturbation treatment fails for the charge-transfer
  transition due to the importance of configuration interaction in the description
  of the state.
