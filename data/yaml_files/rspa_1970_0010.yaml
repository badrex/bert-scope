tldr: This study investigates the heat of adsorption of hydrogen on nickel metal wires.
  The researchers found that the heat of adsorption varies depending on the surface
  coverage and temperature. At 86K, the heat of adsorption shows a linear relationship
  with surface coverage, while at 279K, the heat of adsorption has a stepwise character.
  The results suggest that nickel surfaces behave as a homogeneous set of localized
  sites, offering insights into the energetics of adsorbed hydrogen films.
