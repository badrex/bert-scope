tldr: This article discusses the role of the phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns) cycle in
  early development, particularly in egg activation and pattern formation during embryogenesis.
  The author reviews studies on various species, including sea urchins and frogs,
  and explores the connection between PtdIns cycle activity and intracellular calcium
  changes in regulating cell proliferation. The article also highlights the involvement
  of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins (G-proteins) in coupling sperm-egg interaction
  with phospholipase activation.
