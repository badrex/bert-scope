tldr: This article extends Lighthill's theory of aerodynamic sound to include arbitrary
  convective motion and surfaces. The authors develop general expressions for the
  equivalent sources of aerodynamic bounding surfaces with adjacent turbulent flow.
  They discuss the radiated field by source distributions in arbitrary motion and
  the sound generated by turbulent flow around high-speed aerodynamic surfaces. The
  study shows that surface effects can be treated unambiguously only at low subsonic
  speeds, while at high supersonic speeds, the field is dominated by an intensive
  beaming along the directions of Mach wave emission that lie normal to the surface.
