tldr: The article discusses the damage caused to spermatozoa by rapid chilling, known
  as 'cold shock,' and explores methods to avoid or minimize this damage. The authors
  found that cooling spermatozoa slowly and allowing sufficient time between temperature
  changes can prevent damage. They also highlight the importance of further research
  to understand the effects of different cooling rates and temperature ranges on cell
  damage.
