tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study electron emission from glowing solids
  and the production of rare gases through electric discharges. They found that the
  electron emission can arise from thermal agitation alone, but it can be aided or
  hindered in various ways. The authors also investigated the methods used to produce
  neon and helium in vacuum tubes and discussed the importance of excluding air from
  the apparatus to avoid interference.
