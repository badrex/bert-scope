tldr: The authors study the incorporation of nitrogen impurities in synthetic diamond
  growth, focusing on the crystallography and properties of different growth sectors.
  They find that nitrogen concentration decreases in the sequence {111}, {100}, {113},
  and {110} growth sectors and that {110} growth facets effectively reject nitrogen
  incorporation. The research also explores the use of various techniques, such as
  infrared absorption and cathodoluminescence, to analyze the diamond's properties
  and understand the relationship between nitrogen content and lattice parameter increase.
