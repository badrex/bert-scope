tldr: The authors investigated the hyperfine structure of potassium's resonance lines
  using an atomic beam. They discovered two very narrow absorption lines in each resonance
  line, with a separation of approximately 0.015 cm^-1. This method of using atomic
  beams can resolve very close hyperfine structures and is applicable to any element
  with resonance lines in a region where high-resolution spectroscopic instruments
  can be used.
