tldr: This study investigates the densities and phase behavior of the water-phenol
  system. The authors measure the densities of phenol-water solutions at various concentrations
  and temperatures, observing a critical solution temperature where the densities
  of the two phases become equal. They also discuss the possibility of ionization
  in highly concentrated phenol solutions and the relationship between the density
  and temperature of the conjugate solutions.
