tldr: This article investigates the inhibiting action of oxygen and hydrogen chloride
  in the formation of hydrogen chloride. The authors found that the rate of reaction
  is proportional to the light absorbed and that hydrogen chloride has a significant
  inhibiting effect on the reaction. They propose a mechanism of reaction that explains
  the observed results and allows for the calculation of quantum efficiencies over
  a wide range.
