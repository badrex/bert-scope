tldr: The author investigates the morphological changes in bacteria when exposed to
  different environments and concludes that bacteria can reproduce in various ways
  beyond simple binary fission. The study of bacterial life-cycles and adaptations
  is essential for understanding their role in both saprophytic and parasitic conditions.
  This research challenges the current understanding of bacteria as unicellular organisms
  and suggests that their life-cycles can be complex.
