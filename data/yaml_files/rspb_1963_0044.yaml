tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand how human observers process
  information when their attention is divided. They found that when people try to
  focus on one task while also monitoring another, their ability to detect signals
  in the second task is affected. The authors propose a statistical model for signal
  detection, which suggests that the brain makes decisions based on the probability
  of a signal and the values associated with it. They also discovered that one parameter
  in the model remains unchanged when attention is divided, while another parameter
  changes, indicating that the strength of the signal is affected by divided attention.
