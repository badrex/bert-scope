tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the refractive index of gaseous
  fluorine, a challenging task due to fluorine's low refractivity and the presence
  of impurities. They used various methods to analyze the gas mixture and correct
  for impurities, ultimately obtaining a more accurate measurement of fluorine's refractive
  index.
