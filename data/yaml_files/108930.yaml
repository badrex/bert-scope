revised_title: On the Ratio of Electromagnetic to Electrostatic Force and Its Relation
  to the Velocity of Light
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Electromagnetic force
- Electrostatic force
- Electromagnetic theory of light
- Maxwell's equations
- Velocity of light
tldr: The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, compares electrostatic and electromagnetic forces
  and demonstrates their relationship to the velocity of light. He explains that the
  ratio of these forces is a velocity, which is independent of the standards of length,
  time, and mass. This discovery is significant for understanding the propagation
  of electromagnetic disturbances through a dielectric medium and has implications
  for various applications, such as submarine telegraph cables and induction coils.
