tldr: The author corrects an error in their previous article about the complex wavenumber
  eigenvalues of Laplace's tidal equations for oceans bounded by meridians. They provide
  the corrected eigenvalues and discuss the methods used to calculate them, including
  a comparison of Chebyshev, Fourier, and associated Legendre function expansions.
  The author also clarifies some conclusions from the previous article.
