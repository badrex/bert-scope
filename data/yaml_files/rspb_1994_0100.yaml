tldr: Researchers recorded visual evoked potentials (VEPs) from healthy subjects to
  study the timing of activity in human area V4, a region of the brain responsible
  for color processing. Using dipole source analysis, they identified three active
  brain regions corresponding to areas VI, V2, and V4, which showed sequential but
  overlapping activity. Activity in area V4 started at 100 ms and peaked at 135 ms
  after the onset of the visual stimulus. This study provides valuable information
  about the time course of activity in specialized areas of the human occipital lobe.
