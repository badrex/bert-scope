tldr: The author presents a case study of a ten-day-old infant who died from a congenital
  heart malformation. The infant's heart had only one ventricle and one auricle, with
  the pulmonary artery missing. The study provides insights into the anatomy and physiology
  of the heart and the implications of such malformations on the pulmonary circulation.
