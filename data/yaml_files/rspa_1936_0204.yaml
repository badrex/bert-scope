tldr: The authors conducted experiments to produce and identify artificially produced
  helium through neutron bombardment of lithium and boron. They used a manometric
  measurement method and spectroscopic analysis to confirm the presence of helium
  and determine its purity. This research contributed to the understanding of nuclear
  physics and the development of new methods for producing artificial elements.
