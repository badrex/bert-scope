tldr: The Surface Water Acidification Project (SWAP) Palaeolimnology Programme used
  improvements in lake sediment analysis techniques to trace the history of selected
  study sites and evaluate alternative causes for lake acidification. The project
  focused on using palaeolimnological methods to address issues related to lake acidification,
  which was initially believed to be caused by acid deposition. The study involved
  various techniques, including diatom, chrysophyte, cladoceran, chironomid, pollen,
  trace metal, sulfur, carbonaceous particle, magnetic mineral, and polycyclic aromatic
  hydrocarbon (PAH) analysis, to reconstruct changes in water acidity and atmospheric
  contamination.
