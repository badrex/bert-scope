tldr: The author presents a new approach to the thermo-dynamics of stationary systems,
  focusing on the thermo-element. They introduce two assumptions and discuss the experimental
  elements underlying their treatment of the problem. The author emphasizes the importance
  of utilizing the reciprocity relation and provides a thorough analysis of the relations
  between heat and electrical currents in stationary systems.
