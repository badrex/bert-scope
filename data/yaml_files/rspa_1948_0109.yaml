tldr: The authors investigated the electrokinetic potential of barium sulfate by recrystallizing
  it from hot concentrated sulfuric acid and studying its behavior in saturated solutions.
  They found that the potential is influenced by various electrolytes and is a logarithmic
  function of the activity of the electrolyte solution. The results provide insights
  into the electrokinetic properties of barium sulfate and its potential applications.
