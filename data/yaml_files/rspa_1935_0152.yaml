tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the specific heat of a supraconducting
  alloy and found that there was no appreciable discontinuity in the specific heat
  at the transition point. This result challenges Rutgers's formula, which cannot
  be applied in its simple form to this type of alloy. The authors propose possible
  explanations for this discrepancy and suggest further magnetic and thermal investigations
  on alloys to determine the validity of these explanations.
