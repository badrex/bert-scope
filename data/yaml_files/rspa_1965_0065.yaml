tldr: This article presents a functional theory for non-simple fluids and materials,
  focusing on multipolar continuum mechanics. The authors develop constitutive equations
  for these materials, considering both space differential and space functional types.
  They also discuss the restrictions on the form of these equations due to material
  symmetry and establish relations between different types of non-simple fluids. The
  study provides a foundation for understanding and analyzing complex materials and
  their behavior under various conditions.
