tldr: The author, Richard Waller, examines the unique structure and mechanism of the
  woodpecker's tongue, which is used to catch insects and worms. He explains the anatomy
  of the tongue, including its bony cartilages and muscles, and provides detailed
  illustrations to help understand its function. Waller also compares and contrasts
  various theories and descriptions of the tongue's mechanism from other researchers,
  highlighting the differences and inaccuracies in their accounts.
