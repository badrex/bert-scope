tldr: The author examines the hypothesis that aggression and consumption in solitary
  ancestors of termites and cockroaches are responsible for the presence of protozoans
  in their modern lineages. The author argues that there is no evidence for transfaunation
  of gut protozoans via aggressive and consumptive behavior in natural populations
  of extant Cryptocercus and Zootermopsis, and that it is unlikely that the solitary,
  non-woodfeeding ancestors proposed by Thorne would share the behavioral attributes
  of extant social woodfeeders.
