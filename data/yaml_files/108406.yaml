tldr: The author, John Stenhouse, conducted experiments to study the effects of nitric
  acid on various plants, focusing on the Populus balsamifera. Through these experiments,
  he discovered a new acid called nitropopulic acid. The author provides detailed
  instructions on how to extract and purify nitropopulic acid, as well as its properties
  and reactions with other chemicals. This research sheds light on the chemical composition
  of plants and the potential applications of nitropopulic acid.
