tldr: In 1761, a remarkable agitation of the sea and two thunderstorms were observed
  in Cornwall, England. The sea's sudden and violent movements surrounded a plough
  and its driver, while a church and tower were damaged by lightning. These events
  were also felt in other nearby harbors. The author, William Borlase, provides detailed
  accounts of these incidents and their effects.
