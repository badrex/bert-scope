tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the rate of assimilation in plant
  leaves, specifically in Helianthus annuus, under natural conditions. They used the
  half-leaf dry-weight method to measure the rate of increase in dry weight and found
  that stomatal aperture plays a significant role in regulating the rate of assimilation.
  The results suggest that the earlier work on this topic had some errors, and the
  authors provide a more accurate method for measuring assimilation rates in plant
  leaves.
