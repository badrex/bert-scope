tldr: This article discusses the challenges and limitations of applying inverse methods
  to interpret oceanic tracer data and suggests alternative approaches to improve
  the accuracy and reliability of the results. The author highlights the importance
  of considering the forward problem and nonlinear aspects of the inverse problem,
  as well as the need for appropriate mathematical representation and selection of
  transport coefficients.
