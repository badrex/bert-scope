tldr: The author compares the results of sound velocity experiments conducted by Captain
  Parry and Lieutenant Foster in the Arctic regions with the theoretical formula of
  Laplace. The author concludes that the data used in the calculations are more uncertain
  in extreme cold, but the general agreement of the results supports the validity
  of the observations. Captain Parry's experiments provide strong evidence of his
  exemplary accuracy despite the challenges faced during Arctic exploration.
