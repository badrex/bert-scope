tldr: This article discusses the advanced methods of energy conversion, specifically
  focusing on magnetohydrodynamic power generation and leakage currents in segmented
  electrode generators. The authors analyze three methods to study the effect of leakage
  currents and obtain the electrical characteristics of these generators. They also
  examine the shorting mechanism, which has been previously neglected in the field.
