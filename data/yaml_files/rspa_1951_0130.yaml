tldr: This study investigates the uptake of radioactive potassium, rubidium, and phosphorus
  in the metabolism of Bact. lactis aerogenes. The authors found that the flow of
  alkali cations and phosphate anions into the cell occurs in parallel during the
  early stages of growth or glucose oxidation. The dehydrogenase and deaminase activities
  are affected by pH and can be compensated for by the uptake of potassium or rubidium
  ions. Protective responses to adverse pH involve absorption of alkali-metal ions
  and adaptive changes during growth.
