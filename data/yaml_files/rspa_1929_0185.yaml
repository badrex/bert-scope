tldr: The authors used X-ray diffraction to investigate the structure of naphthalene
  and anthracene molecules. They found that both molecules do not exhibit a plane
  of symmetry and proposed a structure based on a hexagon model. The results provide
  a better understanding of the molecular structure of these organic compounds.
