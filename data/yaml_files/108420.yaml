tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive study of tidal streams in the North Sea
  and English Channel, analyzing data from various sources to create twelve charts
  illustrating the direction and rate of the streams. The study found that the streams
  always run in contrary directions, meeting between specific locations and oscillating
  within a certain range. The author also discovered an intermediate stream in the
  Strait of Dover, which forms a unique feature in the tidal system of the Channel.
