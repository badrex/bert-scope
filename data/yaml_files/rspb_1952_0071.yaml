tldr: The author examines lung growth in humans and other vertebrates, focusing on
  the relationship between structural complexity and tension in elastic fibers. They
  find that the structural complexity of lungs at term is the same across different
  species, and that lung growth is responsible for the physical forces acting on elastic
  fibers. The study also provides evidence that the range of growth is the same in
  humans and rabbits.
