tldr: The authors analyzed the orbit of the Meteor 3-01 rocket (1985-100B) at 13th-order
  resonance, using 5865 observations to determine four lumped harmonic coefficients
  of order 13 and two of order 26 in the geopotential. The results provide a stringent
  test of comprehensive geopotential models at 13th order and are some of the most
  accurate obtained by any method for geopotential harmonics of this order.
