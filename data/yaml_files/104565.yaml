tldr: Dr. Stephen Hales conducted electrical experiments and observed different colors
  in electrical discharges from various materials, such as iron, brass, and an egg.
  He also suspected that strong electrical shocks could cause women to miscarry and
  shared the benefits of ventilators in maintaining good health in confined spaces
  like Newgate prison and the Success Frigate.
