tldr: The author, Lyon Playfair, discovered a new class of salts called nitroprussides
  through the reaction of nitric acid on prussides. These compounds exhibit unique
  coloration with soluble sulfides and have potential applications in various chemical
  reactions. The author also developed a method to obtain nitroprussides in large
  quantities.
