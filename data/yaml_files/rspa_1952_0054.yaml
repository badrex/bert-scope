tldr: Researchers used infra-red spectroscopy to study the structure of ribonuclease
  crystals. They found that the crystal's chain orientation and folded polypeptide
  structure could be determined by observing its dichroism. This method combined with
  X-ray diffraction patterns provided valuable insights into the protein's structure.
