tldr: The author analyzes a planar mapping with periodic orbits of periods 1, 2, and
  3 and no chaotic behavior. They explore the global dynamics of the mapping, revealing
  self-similar structure and heteroclinic behavior in the invariant manifolds. The
  study provides a detailed understanding of the mapping's properties and raises questions
  about the stability of these features under certain perturbations.
