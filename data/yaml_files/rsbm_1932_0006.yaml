tldr: Albert Abraham Michelson was a renowned physicist who made significant contributions
  to the field of physical optics and the study of light. He conducted refined measurements
  and developed interferometry methods to measure the velocity of light and the wavelength
  of light. Michelson's work on the Michelson-Morley experiment, the study of light
  in refracting media, and the determination of the standard meter using light wavelengths
  made him one of the highest authorities in physical optics.
