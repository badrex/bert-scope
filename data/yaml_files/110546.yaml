tldr: The author, R. Murphy, investigates the constituent parts of the roots of algebraic
  equations by considering the conditions under which they vanish. He shows that the
  roots contain a rational part and that other parts are related to the roots. This
  analysis helps in understanding the relations between the roots and solving problems.
