tldr: Philip Burton Moon was an experimental physicist who made significant contributions
  to atomic and nuclear physics, chemistry, and other scientific fields. He is known
  for his work on neutron thermalization, selective absorption of slow neutrons, and
  the development of high-speed rotors for studying chemical reactions and nuclear
  resonant scattering. Moon's research had a lasting impact on the understanding of
  neutron behavior and the broader field of nuclear physics.
