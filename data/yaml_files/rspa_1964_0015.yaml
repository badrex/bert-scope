revised_title: 'Phonon Spectrum and Thermal Energy of Sodium: Toya''s Method with
  a Modified Interference Factor'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Solid State Physics
semantic_tags:
- Phonon spectrum
- Sodium
- Thermal energy
- Toya's method
- Interference factor
tldr: The authors used Toya's method to study the interaction of lattice vibrations
  with electrons in sodium. They modified the interference factor to improve the accuracy
  of the phonon spectrum and thermal energy calculations. The results show good agreement
  with experimental data for frequencies above 40 K, but some disagreement below this
  temperature may be due to the existence of two phases.
