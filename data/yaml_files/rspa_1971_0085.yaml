revised_title: Coordinate Conditions in Riemannian Spaces for Coordinates Based on
  a Subspace
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Geometry
semantic_tags:
- Riemannian geometry
- Coordinate conditions
- Geodesics
- Subspace coordinates
- Metric tensor
tldr: The authors present coordinate conditions for a Riemannian space based on geodesics
  drawn orthogonal to a subspace. They derive simple coordinate conditions that express
  the metric tensor in terms of integrals of the linear part of the covariant Riemann
  tensor. These results are applicable to the space-time of general relativity.
