tldr: The author explores the properties and uses of koji, a Japanese fermenting agent,
  and its diastase, which converts starch into fermentable matter. Koji is used in
  the production of sake, a popular alcoholic beverage in Japan, and also has applications
  in bread-making and the manufacture of soy sauce. The study examines the process
  of koji production, the role of temperature in its growth, and the chemical reactions
  that occur during fermentation.
