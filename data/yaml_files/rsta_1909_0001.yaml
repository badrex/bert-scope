tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the atomic weight of chlorine
  by burning hydrogen in an atmosphere of chlorine and condensing the hydrogen chloride
  formed. The results showed a mean atomic weight of chlorine of 35.462, which is
  close to the values obtained by other methods. This research contributed to the
  understanding of atomic weights and the accuracy of chemical analysis.
