tldr: This article discusses the relevance of highland rock ages to lunar stratigraphy
  and the Moon's evolution. It presents arguments in favor of a "crater dominated
  chronology," suggesting that radiometric ages do not necessarily reflect the time
  of basin-forming impacts and the deposition of associated hot ejecta blankets. Instead,
  they reflect overall influx rates for small and medium-sized meteoroids that have
  cratered the lunar highlands.
