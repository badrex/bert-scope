tldr: This article discusses the history of lake acidification in Finland, focusing
  on the role of human activities and the impact on aquatic ecosystems. Researchers
  have reconstructed the pH levels of 50 lakes, finding that 23 have clearly acidified
  during the 20th century. The vulnerability of Finnish lakes to acid deposition highlights
  the need for further research into the causes of acidification and the development
  of defense strategies.
