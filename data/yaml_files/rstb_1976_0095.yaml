tldr: 'This article discusses the structure and assembly of bacteriophage #x3A6;29,
  a small and morphologically complex virus. The authors describe the capsid geometry,
  protein composition, and the role of specific genes in the assembly process. They
  propose that the capsid of #x3A6;29 is based on icosahedral symmetry and provide
  insights into how other viruses and complex biological structures may be assembled.'
