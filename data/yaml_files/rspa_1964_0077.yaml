tldr: The authors calculated cross-sections for the elastic collisions of slow positrons
  by hydrogen atoms using various approximations, including virtual positronium formation
  and polarization potential. They found that these approximations provided satisfactory
  results when compared to other methods. This study may help in understanding the
  relative importance of different effects in positron scattering and could be useful
  for dealing with slow collisions of positrons with other atoms.
