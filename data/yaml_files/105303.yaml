tldr: The author, John Andrew Peyssonel, discovered worms that form sponges and observed
  their role in sponge growth. These worms live in the sponges' fibrous structure
  and are responsible for the sponges' growth and expansion. Peyssonel also described
  the worms' transparent bodies, their movement, and their ability to adapt to different
  sponge species.
