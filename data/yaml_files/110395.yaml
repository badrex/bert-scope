tldr: In 1832, a team led by Commander De Roos attempted to recover treasure and stores
  from the wreck of the Thetis, which had sunk in a cove near Cape Frio. They used
  a diving bell to explore the underwater area and moved large rocks to access the
  treasures. The team successfully recovered 15/16ths of the property and returned
  to Rio de Janeiro without any loss of life.
