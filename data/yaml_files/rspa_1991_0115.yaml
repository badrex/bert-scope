tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the distribution of thin-skin
  electromagnetic fields around surface-breaking cracks in metals. The authors develop
  a mathematical model for cracks of general shape and provide numerical calculations
  for rectangular and semi-elliptical cracks. The results are validated through experimental
  measurements on a mild steel plate with a rectangular notch. The study highlights
  the importance of understanding the behavior of electromagnetic fields in the vicinity
  of surface-breaking cracks for non-destructive evaluation techniques.
