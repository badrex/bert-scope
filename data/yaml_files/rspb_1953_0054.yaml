tldr: The authors studied the thalamo-cortical connections of the general sensory
  cortex in Macaca monkeys. They found that area 3 receives connections from most
  of the cells in the rostral half and at least 50% of the cells in the caudal half
  of the posterior ventral nucleus, while area 1 receives the exclusive projection
  of a proportion of the cells in the caudal half. The results of these experiments
  are discussed in relation to clinical observations of dissociated sensory loss following
  lesions of the postcentral gyrus in humans.
