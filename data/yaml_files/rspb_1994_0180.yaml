tldr: The article examines the effect of postjunctional folds on neuromuscular transmission
  and muscle excitation. It finds that the presence of folds increases local depolarization
  at the top of the interfold, leading to the activation of more sodium channels in
  the postsynaptic membrane. This amplification of neuromuscular transmission can
  result in excitation spreading to the remainder of the muscle with fewer quanta
  required compared to the absence of folds.
