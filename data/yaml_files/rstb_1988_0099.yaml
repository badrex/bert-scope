tldr: The article discusses the epidemiology and ecology of leishmaniasis, focusing
  on the transmission of the diseases through ecological interactions with sandfly
  vectors and mammalian hosts. It highlights the existence of various Leishmania species
  and their specific relationships with sandfly vectors, which play a crucial role
  in the transmission of the diseases to humans. The article also explores the impact
  of environmental changes on the prevalence and incidence of human leishmaniasis
  in different regions.
