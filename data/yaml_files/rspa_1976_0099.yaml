tldr: The author presents an outline of the geochronology and tectonic units of the
  basement complex in northeast Africa, using new geological mapping and age determinations.
  They identify various tectonic trends and discuss the different units, including
  the Eburnian age events, the northeast trending fold belt, and the Pan African age
  Mozambique belt. The study provides a better understanding of the region's geological
  history and structure.
