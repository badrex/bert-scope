tldr: The author describes four balloon ascents conducted to investigate meteorological
  and physical phenomena at various heights in the atmosphere. The main focus was
  on determining temperature and hygrometric conditions of the air. The author also
  explains the instruments and methods used, such as barometers, thermometers, and
  hygrometers, to collect accurate data during the balloon ascents.
