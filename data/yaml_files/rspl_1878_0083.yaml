tldr: The article describes the unique echinoderm Astrophiura, which exhibits characteristics
  of both Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea. This organism is considered an intermediate
  form that helps bridge the differences between the two orders. Further research
  is needed to understand its exact position in the evolutionary tree, but Astrophiura's
  unique features make it an important subject for study in the field of zoology.
