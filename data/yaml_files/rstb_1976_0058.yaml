tldr: The article presents the United Kingdom's contribution to the International
  Biological Programme, focusing on work capacity, thermal responses, and lung function
  in various populations. UK investigators developed techniques to assess work capacity,
  heat tolerance, and respiratory function under field conditions. The study found
  that body size, muscularity, and training played significant roles in determining
  inter- and intra-population variance. The results from different regions provided
  insights into the biological limitations set by environmental conditions and the
  fitness, nutritional status, and health of inhabitants.
