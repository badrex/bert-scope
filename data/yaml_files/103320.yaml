tldr: Edmund Halley investigates the change in latitudes of some prominent stars and
  compares them to the observations made by ancient astronomers like Ptolemy and Hipparchus.
  He finds that the latitudes of three stars contradict the supposed greater obliquity
  of the ecliptic and suggests that these stars may have a particular motion of their
  own, which could be responsible for the observed changes.
