tldr: The authors introduce a new vector analysis that represents vectors using infinitesimal
  lengths and components in any coordinate system. This analysis is applied to a four-dimensional
  space and can be used to study electrodynamics and the principles of relativity.
  The authors demonstrate how this notation can be used to understand and work with
  vectors in various situations, including those involving curved lines and non-Euclidean
  geometries.
