tldr: The authors used X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to study the effects of ion
  bombardment on diamond surfaces. They found that ion bombardment causes significant
  structural changes, displacing many carbon atoms to sites of lower coordination.
  The study also revealed that the implanted argon distribution follows an exponential
  decay with depth. The authors also discussed the implications of their findings
  for understanding the processes involved in surface chemistry and the potential
  applications of ion implantation techniques in diamond.
