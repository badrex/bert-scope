tldr: The author modifies the nonlinear Schrödinger equation to improve its range
  of validity for deep water waves. They include new terms in the evolution equation
  for the wave amplitude and take into account the mean flow caused by the radiation
  stress of the modulated wave. The study shows that the dominant effect comes from
  the induced mean flow, which changes the stability properties of the wave train.
