tldr: The author explains the crystal-photoeffect, a new phenomenon observed in semi-conductors,
  and provides a theoretical explanation for the experimental facts. The crystal-photoeffect
  occurs when light is absorbed by a semi-conductor, causing a potential hill that
  leads to a new photoelectric effect. The author uses quantum mechanics and the concept
  of a potential hill to describe the behavior of electrons in semi-conductors and
  how the crystal-photoeffect can be explained.
