tldr: The author, John Thomas Graves, attempts to rectify inaccuracies in logarithmic
  formulae, focusing on the development of f0 and f-1 0. He provides a new method
  for developing y and x in terms of a and proposes a solution for the case when a
  is negative or impossible. This work contributes to the understanding of exponential
  theory and offers a more complete set of logarithmic formulae.
