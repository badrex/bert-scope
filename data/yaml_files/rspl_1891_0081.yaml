tldr: The author discusses the effects of hemisection and degeneration in the spinal
  cord, observing that vaso-motor disturbances occur on the same side as the lesion.
  Experiments on stimulation of the cortex cerebri show that the block in the spinal
  cord persists even with a return of associated movements. This research contributes
  to the understanding of the origin and course of certain long and short tract fibers
  in the spinal cord.
