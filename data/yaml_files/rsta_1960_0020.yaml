tldr: The authors provide a general theoretical treatment of the linearized Boltzmann
  equation for flow in a bounded medium, considering various types of particles such
  as gas molecules, electrons, and phonons. They focus on elucidating results for
  a specimen of general cross-section and discuss boundary conditions related to particle
  scattering by the specimen surfaces. The study covers different types of particle
  collisions and their effects on particle flow, providing a comprehensive understanding
  of the Boltzmann equation for various situations.
