tldr: The author presents an apparatus for testing the sensitiveness of safety-lamps
  in detecting firedamp, a dangerous gas in coal mines. The device allows for the
  creation of mixtures of firedamp and air in known proportions, enabling the testing
  of different safety-lamp designs. The author finds that Ashworth's improved Hepplewhite-Gray
  lamp is the most suitable for both efficient illumination and delicate gas-testing
  purposes.
