tldr: The author investigates the learning process in Octopus, discovering that the
  nervous system changes rapidly in response to stimuli. They found that Octopus can
  learn to associate a food item with a painful stimulus, demonstrating the plasticity
  of their nervous system. This research provides insights into the growth and plasticity
  of the nervous system and the potential for studying learning processes in other
  animals.
