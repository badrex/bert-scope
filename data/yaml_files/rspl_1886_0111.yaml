scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Dielectric materials
- Electrification
- Liquid dielectrics
- Electromotive force
- Double refraction
tldr: The author discusses Professor Quincke's experiments on the dielectric properties
  and electrification of liquids. They analyze the results and address concerns about
  the relationship between electrification and electromotive force. The author also
  mentions the property of double refraction in liquids due to electrification.
