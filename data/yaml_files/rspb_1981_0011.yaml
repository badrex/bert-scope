tldr: The study investigates the neurobiology of the scallop's escape behaviors triggered
  by starfish. It explores the neural pathways and mechanisms involved in the jump
  and swim responses, revealing that these behaviors are centrally organized and coordinated
  by the cerebral ganglion. The research also provides evidence for an active relaxation
  mechanism in the scallop's smooth muscle, challenging previous hypotheses about
  the neural basis of swimming and tonic contractions.
