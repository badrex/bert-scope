tldr: The authors studied the crystal structure of 3CdSO4·8H2O and found that the
  main feature is a packing of Cd and SO4 ions, with water molecules adapting to the
  interstices in the structure. The environments of the waters in this crystal are
  of interest. The unit cell contains four molecules of 3CdSO4·8H2O, and the structure
  is defined by 38 parameters. The agreement between calculated and observed F values
  is shown in a table, indicating a correct structure.
