tldr: The authors conducted a histological study to precisely locate the visual area
  of the human cerebral cortex. They found that the primary visual area occupies the
  body of the calcarine fissure and is pear-shaped with the apex anteriorly. The study
  also showed that the area is reduced in extent and distribution in cases of old-standing
  optic atrophy and anophthalmos. The research helps to understand the cortical projection
  of the corresponding halves of both retinae.
