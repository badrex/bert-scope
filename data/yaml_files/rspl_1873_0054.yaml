tldr: The author, Robert Mallet, calculates the volume of crushed rock needed for
  volcanic energy based on the heat generated by the Earth's contraction. He estimates
  the amount of crushed and extruded rock necessary for the heat to support existing
  volcanic action and the volume of material heated or molten annually from volcanic
  cones. Mallet also calculates the actual amount of annual contraction of the Earth,
  which is responsible for volcanic action, and its effects on the Earth's radius
  and the length of the day.
