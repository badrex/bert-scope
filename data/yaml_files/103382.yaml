tldr: This article presents a case study of a boy who survived without food for an
  extended period. The boy, James Jackson, lived without eating or drinking, only
  washing his mouth with water. He experienced a fever and a shaking body, similar
  to paralysis. During this time, he had no bowel movements or urination. The boy
  eventually regained health but still had limited use of one limb. The case was documented
  by Patrick Blair, James Jackson, Elizabeth Bell, Charles Browne, and Gilbert Anthone.
