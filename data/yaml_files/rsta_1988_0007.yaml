tldr: The article discusses the applications of microwave spectroscopy in studying
  molecular ions, focusing on the detection of molecular ions in interstellar space
  and their role in interstellar chemistry. The author presents the detection of the
  molecular ion in seven interstellar sources and describes the rotational spectra
  of the ion in various vibrational states. The article also compares the effects
  of Stark broadening on molecular ions and neutrals, as well as the differences between
  normal glow discharges and magnetically confined abnormal discharges.
