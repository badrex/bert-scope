tldr: This article analyzes the likelihood and consequences of degraded-core accidents
  in pressurized-water reactors, focusing on the proposed Sizewell B reactor. The
  analysis concludes that such accidents are highly improbable, and the plant has
  been designed to reduce their frequency to around 10^-6 per year. The containment
  building would only fail in a small proportion of degraded-core accidents, and the
  release of radioactivity to the environment would be minimal. The individual risk
  of accidental death near the reactor would only increase by 1 in 100,000, and the
  risk of death due to cancer would also see a small increase. The article emphasizes
  the large margin of safety between the risks estimated for Sizewell B and those
  already present in society.
