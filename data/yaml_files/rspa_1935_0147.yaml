tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the elastic and inelastic cross-sections
  of a mercury atom when colliding with electrons. They found the total, elastic,
  and inelastic cross-sections for electrons with energies ranging from 4 volts to
  180 volts. Additionally, they obtained ionization and excitation functions for specific
  energy losses in mercury, providing valuable insights into atomic and molecular
  physics.
