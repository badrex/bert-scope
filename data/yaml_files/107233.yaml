tldr: The author investigates the process of bark formation in trees and the role
  of alburnum in generating new bark. They discovered that both the bark and alburnum
  can produce a fluid capable of generating a cellular substance, which forms the
  new bark. The author also found that the cellular substance in the bark and alburnum
  allows the true sap to pass through, playing a crucial role in the tree's growth
  and reproduction.
