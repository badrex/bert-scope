tldr: The author investigates the red line of cadmium as a standard of wavelength
  and finds that it is reproducible to an accuracy of at least 0.0001 Angstrom. The
  simplified specification of the International Astronomical Union is found to be
  unsatisfactory, and a new Osram cadmium lamp is suggested as a reliable substitute
  for the Michelson lamp. The author also confirms that a small pressure of air in
  the tube is advantageous for accurate reproducibility of the primary standard.
