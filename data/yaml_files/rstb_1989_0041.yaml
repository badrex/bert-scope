tldr: This study examines the morphology, classification, and evolutionary relationships
  of olenelloid trilobites. The author reviews the exoskeletal morphology of olenelloids,
  including the perrostral and circumocular sutures, and discusses their differences
  from other trilobites. The author concludes that olenelloids are a related group
  within the trilobites and may be classified with other Cambrian trilobites in a
  single order.
