tldr: The authors present a mathematical analysis of the two-dimensional slow motion
  of viscous fluids, focusing on boundary conditions and the flexure of thin plates.
  They also discuss the limitations of their method when applied to external spaces
  and the steady motion of a cylinder through a fluid. This research contributes to
  the understanding of fluid dynamics and its applications in engineering and physics.
