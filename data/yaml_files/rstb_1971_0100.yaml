tldr: The study investigates the development of the corneal surface ultrastructure
  in nocturnal Lepidoptera, focusing on the formation of corneal nipples. The research
  shows that microvilli and MV/LE bridges play a crucial role in corneal topography
  formation. The findings can be applied to understand the morphogenesis of body cuticle
  in insects and the development of the compound eye.
