tldr: The study investigates the linear stability of a rotating, self-gravitating
  fluid sphere with a co-rotating zonal magnetic field, considering buoyancy provided
  by a uniform distribution of heat sources. The research focuses on the effects of
  curvature and finds that the critical Rayleigh number is qualitatively the same
  as for the planar model. The motions prevalent at marginal stability occur in the
  form of a thin cylindrical shell, and the waves drift westward or eastward depending
  on certain parameters. The results are compared with other studies, including Braginsky's
  MAC waves and Busse's dynamo model, and argue that the latter may not be representative
  of planetary magnetism due to convective growth of field associated with convection
  patterns occurring in the whole sphere rather than in a cylindrical shell.
