tldr: Molecular chaperones, also known as heat shock proteins, play a crucial role
  in protein maturation and protect cells from stress. They help in the folding and
  assembly of proteins by binding to them and preventing premature folding. The hsp70
  family interacts with proteins during synthesis, translocation, and assembly, while
  the hsp60 or GroEL family functions as catalysts of protein folding. These proteins
  are essential for maintaining cellular health and function.
