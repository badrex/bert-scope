tldr: Dr. William Herschel investigates the cause of the colored concentric rings
  discovered by Sir Isaac Newton between two object-glasses laid upon one another.
  He conducts a series of experiments using Huygens' lenses and various surfaces to
  study the formation and properties of these rings, including their colors, size,
  and the effects of pressure. He concludes that only two surfaces are essential for
  the formation of concentric rings and that the cause of these phenomena must be
  either in the nature of the rays themselves or in the surfaces.
