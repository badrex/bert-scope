tldr: This article reviews the theoretical developments in understanding bond energies
  and bond lengths of conjugated molecules. It discusses the significance of molecular
  orbitals and how they contribute to the stability of conjugated systems. The author
  also explains the molecular orbital method and its application in calculating the
  properties of conjugated molecules.
