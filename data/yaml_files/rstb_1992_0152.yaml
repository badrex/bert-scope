tldr: This article discusses the effects of Southern Ocean environmental changes on
  seabird, seal, and whale populations in Antarctica. Human over-exploitation has
  caused significant changes in the distribution and abundance of these marine top
  predators. The authors evaluate hypotheses that suggest population increases in
  krill-eating penguins and seals are a result of recovery from exploitation, accelerated
  by the removal of krill-eating whales. The study highlights the importance of understanding
  the links between physical and biological processes and their impact on marine populations
  in the face of future environmental change.
