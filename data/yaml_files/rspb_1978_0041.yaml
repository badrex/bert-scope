tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of Corynebacterium parvum
  on chemical carcinogenesis in mice. They found that a course of intravenous injections
  of C. parvum before a single injection of methylcholanthrene significantly delayed
  or prevented the development of fibrosarcomas in CBA mice. The results suggest that
  macrophages play a key role in inhibiting cancer growth, and further research is
  needed to understand the mechanism behind this phenomenon.
