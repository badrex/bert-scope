tldr: The author investigates the Euler-Lagrange equations for a Lagrange density
  that includes the metric tensor, its first two derivatives, and a vector field.
  They find that the only equations of this type that are second-order in the metric
  tensor and first-order in the vector field are the Einstein field equations with
  an energy-momentum term. Various conditions are obtained under which the Einstein-Maxwell
  field equations become an inevitable consequence.
