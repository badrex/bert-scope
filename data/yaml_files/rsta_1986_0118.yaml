tldr: This article discusses the development and applications of Raman microscopy,
  a non-destructive method for examining and analyzing microscopic samples. The technique
  uses laser light to obtain vibrational spectra of samples, providing information
  about their chemical composition. The authors describe various applications, including
  the characterization of high-temperature corrosion films on metals and the investigation
  of lubricant additives. Raman microscopy has a wide range of applications in various
  research fields, such as material science, and has led to significant advancements
  in non-destructive analysis.
