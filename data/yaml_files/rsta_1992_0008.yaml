tldr: This article investigates the head-on collision of normal shock waves with rubber-supported
  walls, both theoretically and experimentally. The authors develop a physical model
  for describing the collision process and study three different modes of rubber loading.
  They find good agreement between experimental and numerical results, validating
  the model and its numerical solution. This research contributes to understanding
  shock wave interactions with flexible boundaries and has applications in various
  engineering and medical fields.
