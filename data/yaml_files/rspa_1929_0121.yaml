tldr: This study investigates the electrical condition of hot platinum surfaces during
  the adsorption of various gases. The researchers found that the platinum surface's
  charge and behavior were influenced by its previous heat treatment. They observed
  different charges on the surface when exposed to hydrogen, oxygen, and other gases,
  which could help explain the varying catalytic powers of platinum surfaces.
