tldr: The author, Edward Sabine, investigated the moon's diurnal influence on the
  horizontal and vertical components of magnetic force at Toronto. He observed the
  lunar-diurnal variations of the inclination and total force using a magnetometer
  over a five-year period. The results confirmed the moon's magnetic influence on
  Earth and showed that the lunar-diurnal variation is consistent with the hypothesis
  that the moon's magnetism is derived by induction from the Earth's magnetism.
