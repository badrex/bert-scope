tldr: This paper explores the integration of electro-optical design and digital image
  processing to improve the performance of image gathering and restoration. By accounting
  for the critical limitations of image gathering and display, the authors develop
  a Wiener filter that optimizes image restoration and enhance visual quality. The
  study also discusses the use of multiresponse image gathering and Wiener-matrix
  filters to restore images with finer resolution than the sampling interval.
