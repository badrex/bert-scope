tldr: The authors explore the relationship between the quantum theory and the metrics
  of space, specifically focusing on the effects of gravitational and electromagnetic
  fields. They propose a new way to measure the length of a line element and discuss
  the wave equation for an electron moving in an electromagnetic field. The authors
  suggest that the wave equation represents a law of metrics and is comparable to
  the law of gravitation.
