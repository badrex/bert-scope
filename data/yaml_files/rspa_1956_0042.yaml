tldr: The authors conducted calculations for the coherent scattering of y-rays of
  energy 0.64 MeV in mercury. They found that the scattering amplitudes deviate from
  the form-factor for a Dirac K electron, but the deviations are not very significant.
  The results provide insights into the behavior of y-rays and their interactions
  with heavy atoms.
