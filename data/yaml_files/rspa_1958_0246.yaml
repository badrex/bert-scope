tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the ionization potentials and
  Lamb shifts of the ground states of helium. They used various spectral lines to
  calculate these values and found that the experimental values agreed closely with
  the theoretical predictions. This research helped refine our understanding of atomic
  energy levels and the causes of energy level shifts in multi-electron systems.
