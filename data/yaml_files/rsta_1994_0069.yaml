tldr: The authors investigate the light-sensitive Belousov-Zhabotinskii reaction in
  a silica gel and study two ways of deforming wavefront curvature. They create "chemical
  lenses" by using light spots to manipulate the reaction, and observe wave refraction
  and deformation similar to traditional glass lenses in linear optics. They also
  explore spontaneous wavefront deformations due to an instability, causing ripples
  in the wave patterns.
