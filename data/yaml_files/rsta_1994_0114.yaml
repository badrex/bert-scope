tldr: This article explores the connection between Rodney Brooks' subsumption architecture
  for robotics and automatic theorem proving, a key area of artificial intelligence.
  The author finds that there are similarities between the two approaches, challenging
  the distinction between "nouvelle AI" and "good old-fashioned AI." The subsumption
  architecture's potential for theorem proving is examined, highlighting its potential
  for improving efficiency and organization in AI products.
