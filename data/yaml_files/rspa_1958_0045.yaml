tldr: The gas-phase oxidation of butene-2 was studied by A. Blundell and G. Skirrow
  over a temperature range of 289 to 395Â°C. They found that the reaction resembled
  the oxidation of propylene, with excess olefin showing an inhibiting effect. The
  authors discussed reaction processes and suggested that a peroxide precedes the
  formation of acetaldehyde, with branching occurring through the reaction of acetyl
  radicals produced from acetaldehyde.
