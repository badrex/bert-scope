tldr: The authors present a detailed analysis of the molecular structure of α-chymotrypsin,
  a well-studied enzyme. They describe the conformation of the molecule in relation
  to its hydrogen bonding scheme and discuss the possible catalytic mechanism. The
  study reveals a new buried acid group that is part of a hydrogen bonding system
  involving the active serine, which helps explain how serine can become a powerful
  nucleophile through a "charge relay system." The authors also define the catalytic
  binding site using diffraction studies of substrate binding.
