tldr: 'The study examines the phagocytosis process in European green hydra, specifically
  how symbiotic algae, non-symbiotic algae, and latex spheres enter digestive cells.
  Two different types of phagocytosis are observed: sinking into crater-like formations
  and being enveloped by funnel-like extensions of plasma membrane. The research shows
  that the morphology selected does not depend on particle type, indicating that there
  is no specific recognition of symbiotic algae during phagocytosis.'
