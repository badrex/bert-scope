tldr: This article presents a study of four new types of pleochroic haloes (A, B,
  C, and D) found in biotite minerals. The researchers classify these haloes based
  on their structure and ring radii, and discuss their possible origins related to
  radioactive elements. The findings contribute to the understanding of the geological
  and mineralogical processes involving these haloes.
