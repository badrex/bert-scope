tldr: This article discusses the development of the disturbing function, which is
  crucial for understanding the inequalities in the motions of planets caused by their
  mutual attraction. The author, James Ivory, presents a method to expand the function
  in a series of parts that can be computed more efficiently, making it easier for
  astronomers to calculate the place of a planet. This research is essential for the
  progress of physical astronomy.
