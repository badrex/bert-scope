tldr: The authors discuss the role of physics and chemistry in understanding biological
  recognition processes. They explore the hierarchy of concepts and working hypotheses
  used in biology and the importance of molecular shape and specific forces in determining
  chemical behavior. The authors also mention the need for improving the rigor of
  interrelations between different levels of biological systems and eliminating ill-founded
  concepts.
