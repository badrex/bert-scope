revised_title: Analyzing the Distributions of Apparent Open and Shut Times in Single
  Channel Recordings
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Ion channels
- Single-molecule kinetics
- Markov process
- Channel function
- Resolution problem
tldr: This article discusses the challenges of analyzing single ion channel recordings
  when brief events cannot be detected due to resolution limitations. The authors
  derive exact distributions for the apparent open and shut times, allowing for a
  more accurate analysis of the data and better understanding of ion channel function.
