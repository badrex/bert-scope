tldr: The authors investigate the action of cyanide on xanthine oxidase, an enzyme
  involved in the metabolism of purines. They find that cyanide inactivates the enzyme
  completely, even with small concentrations, and that this inactivation is irreversible.
  This study highlights the unique features of cyanide inhibition on xanthine oxidase
  compared to other known cases of enzyme inhibition.
