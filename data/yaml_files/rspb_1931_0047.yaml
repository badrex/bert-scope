tldr: The authors investigated the formation of nitrite by soil bacteria other than
  Nitrosomonas. They discovered that several bacterial strains, A, B, C, D, E, and
  F, isolated from different sources, were capable of oxidizing ammonium salts to
  nitrite. These bacteria grew freely on nutrient agar media containing organic nutrients,
  unlike the nitrosomonas group. The authors also found that these organisms produced
  more nitrite in the presence of sugar, and some could utilize nitrite for their
  metabolism. However, none of the eight organisms could oxidize nitrite into nitrate.
