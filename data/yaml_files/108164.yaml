tldr: The author conducted experiments with different voltaic battery designs and
  combinations to understand their efficiency and effects. They discovered that cylinders
  of a specific diameter produce the most effective conducting plates in a voltaic
  arrangement. The author also observed intense light and heat produced by a high-intensity,
  constant current and the transfer of matter between electrodes during the disruptive
  discharge.
