tldr: This article describes the analysis of mRNA populations in eukaryotic chromosomes
  using nucleic acid reassociation methods. The authors found a predominant component
  in the cytoplasmic RNA of Drosophila melanogaster that sedimented at about 145,
  which turned out to be the larger mitochondrial rRNA. They also observed changes
  in gene expression during development and discussed the appearance of heat-shock
  sequences.
