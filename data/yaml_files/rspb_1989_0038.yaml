tldr: The authors developed a method to determine the kinetic parameters for carrier-mediated
  transport of unlabelled compounds in placental membrane vesicles. They studied the
  effects of external selenate, tungstate, molybdate, and chromate on sulphate efflux
  from brush-border membrane vesicles. The method allows for the analysis of transport
  systems that do not exhibit significant asymmetry, enhancing its applicability.
  The results provide insights into the transport mechanism involved and help distinguish
  between transported ligands and competitive inhibitors.
