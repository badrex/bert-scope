tldr: This article discusses the HLA (Human Leukocyte Antigen) system, which is a
  major histocompatibility system in humans. The HLA system is a complex gene cluster
  with multiple loci that play a crucial role in immune responses and transplantation
  matching. The article reviews the basic genetics of the HLA system, introduces the
  recently defined la antigens, and explores the application of somatic cell genetics
  to analyze the HLA system.
