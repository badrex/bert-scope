tldr: This study investigates the electronic attenuation of shear waves in magnesium,
  zinc, and cadmium crystals. The researchers found that the attenuation in zinc and
  cadmium is highly anisotropic, while it is nearly isotropic in magnesium. They also
  observed screening breakdown in cadmium and analyzed the rapid fall in attenuation
  just below the transition temperature to determine the London penetration depth,
  coherence length, and average Fermi velocity in these metals.
