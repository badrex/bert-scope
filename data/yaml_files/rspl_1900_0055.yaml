tldr: 'The author examines the distribution of vertebrate animals in India, Ceylon,
  and Burma, dividing the regions into nineteen tracts based on physical characteristics
  such as rainfall, temperature, and forest presence. They identify three distinct
  mammalian sub-regions: the Indo-Malay or Oriental, the Aryan, and the Pravidian,
  each with unique constituents and distribution patterns.'
