tldr: The article describes a direct method for reconstructing three-dimensional structures
  from projections in electron microscopy. The method, known as back-projection, involves
  summing projected densities and subtracting a constant term. The authors show that
  this method is equivalent to Fourier synthesis using central sections of the Fourier
  transform of the object. The method is suitable for specimens with rotational or
  helical symmetry and can be used to improve the resolution of electron micrographs.
