tldr: 'This article explores the kinetics of polymer crystallization, focusing on
  the growth rates of lamellar crystals. The authors develop a microscopic model to
  analyze the growth regimes and compare it to continuum models. They find that the
  growth rates differ significantly when edge roughness is significant, and identify
  two distinct growth regimes: regime I and regime II. The study provides insights
  into the physical conditions required for each regime and their implications for
  polymer crystallization.'
