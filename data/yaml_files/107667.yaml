tldr: A young man in Lancashire developed alvine concretions, or stone-like formations,
  in his colon after consuming large quantities of unripe plums, including their stones.
  The concretions caused severe pain, diarrhea, and eventually led to the man's death.
  This case study highlights the potential dangers of ingesting unripe plums and the
  importance of proper nutrition and digestion.
