tldr: This article explores the thermal and magnetic properties of dilute solid solutions,
  focusing on the effects of electron concentration and scattering. The author applies
  these findings to dilute solutions of Ag, Rh, and Ru in palladium, explaining the
  observed changes in magnetic susceptibility due to the presence of different metals.
