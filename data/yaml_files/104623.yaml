tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of the Lacrymae Batavica, or Glass-Drops,
  and their similarities to tempered steel. They discover that the glass drops acquire
  their unique properties when red-hot glass is plunged into cold water, causing the
  particles to be separated by a large amount of fiery particles. The author explains
  that the annealing process, which involves heating the glass to a moderate temperature,
  keeps the pores open and prevents the glass from breaking. This understanding can
  be applied to other fused substances as well.
