tldr: The Ulysses mission, launched in 1990, is the first space probe dedicated to
  exploring the heliosphere out of the ecliptic plane. The mission's first results
  reveal the evolution and disappearance of interplanetary magnetic sector structures,
  the onset of high-speed solar wind streams, signatures of complex coronal mass ejections,
  and the high-latitude structure of the heliospheric magnetic field. These findings
  provide insights into the evolution of large-scale coronal structures, solar magnetic
  fields, and processes controlling the solar activity cycle.
