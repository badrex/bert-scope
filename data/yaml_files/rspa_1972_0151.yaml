tldr: The authors develop a non-local space theory to study the propagation of plasmons
  in periodic lattices, focusing on long wavelengths. They derive an equation of motion
  for density fluctuations and apply the random phase approximation to obtain the
  dispersion relation for a uniform electron gas in the high density limit. The connection
  with Bloch's hydrodynamic model of collective oscillations is also discussed.
