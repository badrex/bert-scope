tldr: The article investigates the relationship between the elevation of cytosolic
  free calcium and the activation of membrane conductance in rat parotid acinar cells.
  The study finds that outward and inward currents are activated by calcium elevation
  and oscillate in phase with oscillations of cytosolic calcium. The outward current
  is due to the activation of a large unit-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-dependent
  K+ channel, while the inward current is likely carried predominantly by Cl-. Buffering
  calcium at resting levels eliminates current responses to muscarinic agonists, suggesting
  that calcium is the only significant second messenger involved in the short-term
  control of this conductance by acetylcholine.
