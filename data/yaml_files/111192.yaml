tldr: The author, John Murray, examines the effects of tides on the North Sea's coasts
  and bed, focusing on the erosion and sedimentation processes. He observes the similarities
  in the western shores of Ireland, Scotland, and Norway and discusses the Atlantic
  flood-tide wave's impact on these regions. Murray also explores the formation of
  sandbanks, shoals, and islands due to the tide's influence and suggests that the
  Dogger Bank's peculiar shape is a result of cotidal waves meeting.
