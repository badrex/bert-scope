tldr: The authors found that worker ants of Camponotus floridanus keep significantly
  smaller brood biomasses when unrelated conspecific workers are perceptible than
  when conspecifics are absent. This reduction occurs even with ad libitum food availability,
  suggesting that decreased brood biomass is a consequence of behavioral decisions
  rather than food limitations or reduced numbers of brood tenders. The study highlights
  the importance of perception of competition and predation risk in ant colony growth.
