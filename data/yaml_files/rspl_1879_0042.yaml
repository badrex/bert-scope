revised_title: The Influence of Heat and Light on Animal Combustion and Respiration
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology
semantic_tags:
- Respiration
- Animal combustion
- Heat and light effects
- Carbonic acid production
- Tropical climate impact
tldr: The author investigates the effects of heat and light on animal respiration
  and combustion. They found that increased heat reduces carbonic acid production,
  while increased light, especially violet and blue light, promotes it. The author
  concludes that more research is needed to understand the impact of tropical climates
  on human body combustion and respiration.
