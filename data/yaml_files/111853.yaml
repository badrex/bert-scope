tldr: The author discusses the process of coal-gas purification using clay and its
  effects on the illuminating power of the gas. Clay is found to remove certain nitrogen
  compounds that reduce the light-giving power of the gas, while also not removing
  valuable hydrocarbon vapours. The author also presents a method to determine the
  value of gas as an illuminant by using acid-treated sawdust.
