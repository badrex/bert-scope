tldr: This article explores the potential scattering of relativistic particles using
  the Dirac and Klein-Gordon equations. It discusses the properties of wave functions
  and the -matrix for various types of potentials, such as finite range potentials.
  The study reveals that the -matrix is a double-valued function of momentum or energy
  with branch points determined by the relativistic energy-momentum relationship.
