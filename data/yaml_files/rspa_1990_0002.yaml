tldr: The author investigates heat transport from a heated region into a fluid in
  shear flow, focusing on large Peclet numbers. They determine the asymptotic form
  of the temperature distribution and the total heat transport, providing insights
  into the contributions of leading and trailing edge solutions. This study is relevant
  for understanding heat transfer in complex fluid dynamics scenarios.
