tldr: The article discusses the development of the British Aircraft Corporation's
  Numerical Master Geometry system, which uses parametric surface mathematics to represent
  aircraft shapes numerically for design and manufacturing. This system offers advantages
  in speed, accuracy, and repeatability compared to traditional lofting techniques,
  and has been successfully implemented in the aircraft industry.
