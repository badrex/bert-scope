tldr: This article presents a sheet model for the candle flame, using the Burke-Schumann
  flame-sheet limit to study the combustion process. The model considers the flow
  induced by the hot flame as a variable-density boundary-layer flow, with transport
  properties assumed to be proportional to the temperature. The main features of the
  calculated flame-sheet shape are in agreement with observations of an ordinary domestic
  candle flame.
