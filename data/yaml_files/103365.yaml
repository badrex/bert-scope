tldr: The author, James Jurin, conducted experiments to understand the suspension
  of water and quicksilver in glass tubes. He discovered that the suspension is due
  to the balance of atmospheric pressure and the cohesive force of the liquid column.
  The experiments also demonstrated that capillary action works in a vacuum, and the
  author proposed a theory based on the attraction between the particles of water
  and glass.
