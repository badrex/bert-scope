tldr: The author, Robert Lee, conducted a study on the nerves and nervous plexuses
  of the gravid uterus. He observed the distribution of nerves and their connection
  with the uterine veins, and described the presence of fasciculated bands on the
  uterus's posterior surface. Lee concluded that these bands were part of the uterus's
  special nervous system.
