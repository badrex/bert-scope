tldr: The authors explore solutions to the Lanczos vacuum wave equation in various
  space-times, focusing on the Lanczos potential and its relationship with the Weyl
  tensor. They analyze different space-time metrics, such as the Bondi and Kasner
  space-times, and use spinor analysis to derive the Weyl-Lanczos relations.
