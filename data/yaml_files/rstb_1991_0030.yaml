tldr: This article discusses the comparative method in evolutionary biology and its
  application to understanding the evolution of reproductive strategies. By using
  phylogenies, researchers can identify independent instances of life-history evolution
  and determine the trade-offs and selective forces responsible for the diversification
  of life-history traits. The authors provide examples from various animal groups
  and demonstrate the importance of considering phylogenetic relatedness when analyzing
  life-history differences.
