tldr: The author investigates the stability of a compressible two-dimensional vortex
  under three-dimensional perturbations. They find that the vortex becomes unstable
  when the wavelength of the perturbation is greater than a critical value, which
  depends on the Mach number of the vortex. A critical boundary is defined to divide
  stable and unstable modes. The study focuses on Rankine vortices and vortices with
  different velocity profiles within the core, showing qualitatively similar behavior.
