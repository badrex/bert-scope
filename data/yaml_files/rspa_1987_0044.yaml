revised_title: Weighted Sobolev Spaces and Exterior Problems for the Helmholtz Equation
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Functional Analysis
semantic_tags:
- Helmholtz equation
- Weighted Sobolev spaces
- Exterior problems
- Radiation condition
- Boundary value problems
tldr: The authors use weighted Sobolev spaces to study existence and uniqueness of
  solutions to exterior problems for the Helmholtz equation. They show that radiating
  solutions satisfy a specific condition and have certain integrability properties,
  providing a unique solution to the problem.
