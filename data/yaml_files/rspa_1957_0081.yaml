tldr: This article investigates correlation effects in liquids and solids near the
  normal boiling point, focusing on the cell theory of liquids. The authors develop
  a harmonic force model and evaluate the binary correlation integral for the 12-6
  potential, finding that the existence of two condensed phases in equilibrium is
  possible. The calculated properties of the liquid are in better agreement with observed
  values for argon than those calculated neglecting correlations.
