tldr: Seychelles warblers adjust their offspring sex ratios based on territory quality.
  They produce more male offspring in low-quality territories and more female offspring
  in high-quality territories. This strategy helps parents gain or maintain helpers
  in high-quality territories, improving their reproductive success. The study provides
  evidence that this facultative sex ratio bias is caused by skewed offspring production
  rather than mortality differences.
