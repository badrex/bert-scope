tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electromotive changes in the
  mammalian spinal cord following electrical excitation of the cortex cerebri. They
  used a sensitive Lippmann's capillary electrometer to detect the changes and found
  that the mammalian nerve showed a marked difference or demarcation current. The
  results provide insights into the relationship between the cortex and the spinal
  cord in the production of epileptic sequences.
