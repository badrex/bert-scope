tldr: The author, Alexander J. Ellis, presents an improved form of Laplace's hypsometrical
  formula for calculating heights with corrections for latitude and temperature in
  barometric hypsometry. He discusses the importance of considering temperature variations
  and provides tables for easier calculations. The author also compares two methods
  of calculating heights and suggests that the gradual method is more trustworthy.
