tldr: This study investigates the elastic behavior of oils during impact, focusing
  on the role of polymer solutions. The authors found that increasing the concentration
  of the polymer solution led to a higher degree of elasticity, with the elasticity
  ratio increasing from zero for the base oil to 0.494 for the 40% polymer solution.
  The results suggest that the degree of elastic recoil depends more on the fluid's
  viscosity than its chemical nature.
