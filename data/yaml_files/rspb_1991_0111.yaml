tldr: The authors investigated the nitrogen uptake and growth of Paracoccus denitrificans,
  a type of bacteria. They found that the bacteria could not store nitrogen internally
  and continued to grow by using an alternative energy source, poly-β-hydroxybutyrate,
  after ammonia depletion in the culture medium. This discovery refutes the previous
  assumption that the bacteria stored nitrogen for future growth.
