tldr: The author examines enterochlorophyll and allied pigments in various animals
  and plants, comparing their spectra and properties. They find that enterochlorophyll
  in animals and plant chlorophyll share similar spectra, suggesting a possible connection
  between their origins. The study also reveals differences between animal and plant
  pigments, as well as the presence of other pigments like haemoglobin and lutein.
