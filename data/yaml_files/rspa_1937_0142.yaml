revised_title: Orbital Degeneracy and Stability of Polyatomic Molecules

tldr: The authors investigate the conditions for a polyatomic molecule to have a stable
  equilibrium configuration when its electronic state has orbital degeneracy. They
  find that stability and degeneracy are not possible simultaneously for non-linear
  molecules, and that linear configurations are the only ones that can be stable for
  degenerate electronic states.
