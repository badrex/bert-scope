tldr: The author investigates the motion in the wake of a thin plate at zero incidence
  in a uniform stream. They develop a method to integrate the linear equations related
  to the motion in the wake close to the trailing edge of the plate. The study provides
  an asymptotic solution for the motion downstream in the wake, which differs from
  previous solutions in the first approximation. The results can be used to improve
  understanding of fluid dynamics and aerodynamics.
