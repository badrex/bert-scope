  Nodules

tldr: The author's experiments show that the relationship between nodule bacteria
  and host plants can change depending on the plant's condition. Inadequate light
  and darkness can lead to nodule bacteria becoming parasitic, attacking the host
  plant's cells and causing nodule tissue to disintegrate. This research highlights
  the importance of understanding plant-host interactions and the factors that can
  influence symbiotic relationships.
