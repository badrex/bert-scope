tldr: This article compares the effects of venom from the Naja tripudians (cobra)
  and Daboia Russellii (viper) snakes on warm- and cold-blooded animals. The authors
  describe the general and local symptoms of poisoning and conduct experiments on
  pigeons, guinea pigs, and other animals to understand the differences in the actions
  of the two venoms on the body's organs. They find that while the general symptoms
  are similar, there are differences in local symptoms and blood coagulation, which
  may be due to the different compositions of the venoms.
