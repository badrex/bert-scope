tldr: The authors studied the band spectrum of aluminium bromide (AlBr) and analyzed
  its vibrational transitions and isotope effects. They observed that the bands were
  grouped in sequences and found that the separations of the heads increased in a
  progression, as expected. The isotope effect was also studied, and the authors concluded
  that the presence of both isotopes (Al-27 and Al-26) and their relative abundance
  affected the spectrum's intensity distribution.
