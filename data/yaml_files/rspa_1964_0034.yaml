tldr: This study investigates the virial coefficients of the carbon dioxide-ethylene
  system, focusing on pure gases. The authors determined the coefficients using the
  series-expansion method and examined various forms of intermolecular potential.
  They found that a Lennard-Jones 6:12 potential accurately represents the second
  virial coefficient of ethylene, while a small discrepancy in the representation
  for carbon dioxide may be rectified by introducing a quadrupole interaction term.
  The research contributes to understanding the properties of gas mixtures in relation
  to their pure constituents.
