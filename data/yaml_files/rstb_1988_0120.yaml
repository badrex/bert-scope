tldr: This article discusses the mapping of the human Y chromosome and the discovery
  of the testis-determining factor (TDF) gene. The authors review past and present
  mapping techniques, including deletion mapping and recombination mapping, and discuss
  the implications of TDF's location on the Y chromosome for understanding sex determination
  in humans.
