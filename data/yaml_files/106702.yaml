tldr: Caroline Herschel, a pioneering astronomer, discovered a new comet in Germany
  while searching for celestial objects near the sun. She observed the comet's position
  and motion, making drawings and comparing them with nearby stars. Although she faced
  challenges due to hazy conditions, she was confident in her findings and requested
  the information be shared with her brother's astronomical friends.
