tldr: This article discusses various counter experiments conducted at the CERN proton
  synchrotron, focusing on the production of associated bosons and high-energy p-p
  diffraction scattering. The experiments provide insights into the behavior of elementary
  particles and contribute to the development of particle physics in Europe.
