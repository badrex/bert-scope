tldr: This article explores the properties of Killing-Yano tensors, which are mathematical
  objects related to symmetries in space-time. The authors classify these tensors,
  derive line elements that admit them, and discuss their physical interpretations.
  They also highlight the connection between Killing-Yano tensors and angular momentum
  in certain situations. The article provides insights into the understanding of space-time
  geometry and its relation to physical phenomena.
