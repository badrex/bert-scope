tldr: The author examines the morphological changes in the oocyte of Antedon, a type
  of echinoderm, to understand the role of cell structures in cell metabolism. They
  study the growth and form of the germinal vesicle, chromatin, nucleolus, yolk nucleus,
  and yolk formation in the oocyte. This research provides insights into the development
  and function of the oocyte in echinoderms and contributes to the understanding of
  cell structures and their significance in cell metabolism.
