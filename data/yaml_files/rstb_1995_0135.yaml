tldr: This article investigates the molecular and cellular events involved in the
  formation of lateral root meristems in higher plants, specifically in radish and
  Arabidopsis. The authors analyze gene expression patterns and cellular division
  patterns in pericycle cells to understand how lateral roots are initiated and organized.
  They find that lateral root formation is a two-stage process, with the formation
  of a primordium followed by the subset of primordial cells functioning as the lateral
  root apical meristem. The study has implications for understanding pattern formation
  in newly organizing organs.
