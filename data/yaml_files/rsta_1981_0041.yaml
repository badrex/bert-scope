tldr: The article describes high-resolution solid state nuclear magnetic resonance
  (NMR) techniques for studying biopolymers, such as amino acids, peptides, proteins,
  and DNA. The authors discuss the differences between solution and solid state NMR
  spectra, focusing on the unique spectral features and line shapes observed in solid
  state NMR. They also explore the potential applications of solid state NMR in biological
  research, including the study of filamentous viruses and supramolecular structures
  like membranes and nucleoprotein complexes.
