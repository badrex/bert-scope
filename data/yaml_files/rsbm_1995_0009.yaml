tldr: Denis Henry Desty was a distinguished scientist and inventor known for his work
  in gas chromatography, combustion research, and environmental pollution reduction.
  He developed innovative techniques for analytical hydrocarbon separations, combustion,
  gas flares, and oil spill treatment, with nearly 500 patents associated with his
  name. Desty's work in combustion research led to the development of the MATRIX burner,
  fluidized beds of ceramic particles, and burners for oil wells. He also contributed
  to the reduction of atmospheric pollution and the efficient use of fuels through
  his work on Coanda flares and the recovery of enthalpy in waste materials.
