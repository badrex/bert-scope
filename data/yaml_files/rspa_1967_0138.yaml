tldr: The article investigates the formation of partial cone cracks in brittle materials
  when a spherical indenter slides across the surface. The analysis shows that sliding
  motion significantly influences the quasistatic stress field and the geometry of
  the cracks. The frictional tractions affect the criteria for surface fracture and
  the shape of the partially developed cones, which are determined by the Poisson
  ratio of the material and the coefficient of friction.
