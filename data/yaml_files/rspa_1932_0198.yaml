tldr: The authors conducted experiments with metal electrodes in air-free solutions
  to study the mechanism of electrode potential. They discovered that the potential
  is primarily an interaction between metal and water, with the concentration of ions
  in the solution acting as a secondary factor. The theory explains that water molecules
  bombard metal ions, creating a layer of ions around the electrode, and equilibrium
  is established when the streams of ions balance. This theory helps to understand
  the behavior of electrode potential in various conditions.
