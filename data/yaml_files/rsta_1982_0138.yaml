tldr: This article discusses the development of new techniques in optical and infrared
  spectroscopy, focusing on frequency and wavelength standards. The authors describe
  the advancements in spectroscopy, including the use of lasers and nonlinear optical
  devices, which have allowed for more precise measurements of frequencies and wavelengths.
  They also discuss the potential for redefining the international metre based on
  the speed of light and primary time standards.
