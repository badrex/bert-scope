tldr: This article presents experiments on electron emission from Langmuir probes
  and glow discharge cathodes. The authors measure the positive ion and electron currents
  at the surface of a negatively charged Langmuir probe in various gases. They discuss
  the results from the perspective of the glow discharge and find that electron emission
  increases with the potential, which is important for understanding the behavior
  of gases in electrical discharges.
