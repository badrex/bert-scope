  and Interpretations'

tldr: This article explores integral theorems in general relativity, specifically
  focusing on electromagnetic fields. The authors develop electromagnetic extensions
  and provide interpretations for these theorems, which are expressed in the form
  of classical Gauss's theorem. They also discuss applications of these theorems,
  including the flux of magnetic intensity, electric intensity, and electricity across
  closed surfaces in space-time.
