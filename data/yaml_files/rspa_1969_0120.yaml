tldr: The authors present the first solution of a molecular transcorrelated wave equation
  for the molecule LiH using a restricted numerical integration procedure. This method
  allows for higher accuracy in energy calculations and has the potential to be applied
  to a wide range of molecules and reacting systems. The transcorrelated method introduces
  factors dependent directly on the interelectronic distance, which can improve the
  accuracy of molecular energy predictions.
