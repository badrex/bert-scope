tldr: The author investigates the mechanism of action of pepsin, a proteinase enzyme,
  and proposes a mechanism compatible with its hydrolytic, transpeptidation, and isotopic
  exchange activities. The study focuses on the amino-enzyme intermediate and examines
  the possibility of an acyl-enzyme intermediate. The author also discusses the rate-determining
  step and attempts to trap the amino-enzyme intermediate using various reagents.
