tldr: The author investigates the origin and development of enamel in vertebrate teeth,
  focusing on the cuticula dentis, a membrane covering the enamel. They conclude that
  the cuticula is formed by the metamorphosed ends of enamel cells, providing insight
  into the formation of teeth in mammals and fish.
