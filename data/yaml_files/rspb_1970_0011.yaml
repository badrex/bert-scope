tldr: The study examines the spermatozoa of the giant octopus, Octopus dofleini martini,
  focusing on their structure and metabolism. The spermatozoa contain a large amount
  of glycogen, which indicates that glycogenolysis represents a pathway of carbohydrate
  metabolism in octopus spermatozoa. The research also reveals the presence of enzymes
  like phosphorylase, phosphoglucomutase, glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, and glucose-6-phosphate
  dehydrogenase, suggesting that octopus spermatozoa may be capable of metabolizing
  glucose-6-phosphate along the oxidative and glycolytic pathways.
