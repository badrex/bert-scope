tldr: The study examines the Oligocene bottleneck, a significant event that caused
  a reduction in available niche space and a drop in regional temperature, leading
  to a genetic bottleneck in many non-marine taxa in New Zealand. The research uses
  molecular data from avian groups, such as kiwi, moa, and acanthisittid wrens, to
  support the existence of this bottleneck and its impact on the New Zealand biota.
