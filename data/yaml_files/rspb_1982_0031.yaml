tldr: The study examines the electrophysiological and morphological changes in the
  motor nerve of mice affected by hereditary'motor endplate disease'. The research
  reveals slower conduction velocity, prolonged refractory period, and increased temperature
  sensitivity in the mutant mice compared to controls. The findings suggest that alterations
  in the motor axons can account for the failures in neuromuscular transmission observed
  in the med mutation.
