tldr: The authors present a direct and simple method to calculate the scattering power
  of a bare nucleus using wave mechanics. They replace spherical polar coordinates
  with paraboloidal coordinates to simplify the analysis. The scattering power is
  defined as the volume density of electricity in the scattered wave when the volume
  density of the incident wave is unity around the nucleus. The authors find that
  the scattering power of a bare nucleus is cosec, which is the classical value obtained
  by Rutherford.
