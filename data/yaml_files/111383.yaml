tldr: The author, Francis Newman, advocates for the use of determinants, also known
  as eliminants, in algebra and geometry, particularly in the study of surfaces of
  the second degree. He demonstrates their utility in solving equations, analyzing
  geometric shapes, and understanding the properties of various surfaces.
