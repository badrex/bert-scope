tldr: The author, Carlo Matteucci, conducted experiments on induced muscle contraction
  and its connection to electromagnetic discharge. Despite facing challenges with
  the galvanometer, he found that induced contraction was due to an electric discharge
  and that muscle contraction was accompanied by a development of electricity. The
  author provided several experiments to support this conclusion.
