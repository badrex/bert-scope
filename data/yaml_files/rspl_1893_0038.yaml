  Formation

tldr: The author discovered that bird blood contains urea, contrary to previous beliefs.
  This finding challenges existing theories on uric acid formation in animals and
  suggests a new synthesis of uric acid production. The presence of urea in bird blood
  is similar to that in mammals, indicating a more complex nitrogen metabolism than
  previously thought.
