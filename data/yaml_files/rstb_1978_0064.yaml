tldr: This article discusses the evolutionary systematics of bivalve molluscs, focusing
  on their phylogenetic relations and early evolution. The authors propose a new subphylum
  classification for molluscs, dividing them into Peltophora and Cochleophora. They
  also describe the various stages of bivalve evolution, from their hypothetical monomyarian
  form to the formation of Autobranchia and Septibranchia, and the role of environmental
  changes in their development.
