tldr: The author, Sir W. De W. Abney, presents a new method to determine the amount
  of color perception deficiency in incomplete color-blind individuals using the Young-Helmholtz
  trichromatic theory. By comparing the mixed lights with white, the author calculates
  the sensation deficiency in partially color-blind people, providing a better understanding
  of their vision and the underlying causes of incomplete color blindness.
