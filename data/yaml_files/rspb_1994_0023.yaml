tldr: This study examines the evolution of female choice in seaweed flies and how
  different mechanisms, such as the Fisher process and viability indicator mechanisms,
  operate in various populations. The researchers found that ecological factors influence
  the effectiveness of these mechanisms, with stable populations preferring large
  males, while tidal populations exhibit disassortative mating to increase offspring
  fitness.
