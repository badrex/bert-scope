tldr: This study investigates the fine structure of atmospheric turbulence and its
  relation to sound propagation. The researchers measured wind fluctuations and correlated
  them with simultaneous sound intensity measurements to understand the impact of
  turbulence on sound propagation. The findings provide insights into the scale of
  turbulence and its effect on the phase relationships between signals picked up at
  different points.
