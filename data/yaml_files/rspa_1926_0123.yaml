tldr: This article presents a crystallographic study of tervalent metallic acetylacetones,
  focusing on their isotrimorphism and molecular structure. The authors use X-ray
  diffraction and various crystallographic techniques to analyze the crystals and
  determine their unit cells. They find that the three forms of the gallium compound
  have been observed in one crystal, and discuss the molecular arrangement and space
  groups of the acetylacetones. The study provides insights into the structure and
  properties of these compounds.
