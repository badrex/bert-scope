tldr: This article investigates the role of chloride transport in stomatal guard cells,
  which play a crucial role in regulating the size of stomatal pores in plants. The
  study shows that guard cells can regulate their solute content in response to environmental
  signals, controlling osmotic flows of water and maintaining turgor and aperture.
  The results provide insights into the processes of salt accumulation in plant cells
  and the mechanisms controlling stomatal pore opening and closing.
