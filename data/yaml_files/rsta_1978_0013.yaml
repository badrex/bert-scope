tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of geological faults and their role in
  crustal deformation. It reviews the various physical processes of faulting and the
  limitations of Anderson's fault classification. The author highlights the importance
  of understanding fault mechanics for effective earthquake prediction and emphasizes
  the need for further study of complex fault systems.
