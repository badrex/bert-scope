tldr: The authors discovered that myokinase, an enzyme found in muscle tissue, has
  the same properties as the Marsh factor. The Marsh factor is known to inhibit ATP-induced
  muscle contraction and bring about muscle relaxation. Myokinase and the Marsh factor
  both have similar effects on muscle fibers, such as reducing ATP-ase activity and
  causing muscle fibers to lengthen. The authors conclude that myokinase and the Marsh
  factor are identical.
