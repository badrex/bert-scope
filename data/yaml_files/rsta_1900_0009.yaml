revised_title: The Comparative Efficiency of Positively and Negatively Charged Ions
  as Condensation Nuclei
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author's experiments demonstrate that negatively charged ions are more efficient
  as condensation nuclei than positively charged ions, which could explain the preponderance
  of negatively electrified rain. This research contributes to understanding the relationship
  between atmospheric electricity and precipitation.
