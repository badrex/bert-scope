tldr: This article presents the exact theory of the double Compton effect, a third-order
  process in which a gamma-ray colliding with a free electron produces two scattered
  photons. The authors derive an expression for the differential cross-section and
  analyze the angular correlations and energy distributions of the scattered photons.
  The results show a preference for one soft and one hard photon, with the hard photon
  most likely to be ejected into a narrow cone in the forward direction.
