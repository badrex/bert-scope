tldr: Peter Barlow conducted experiments to construct an achromatic telescope using
  a fluid concave lens instead of the usual flint glass lens. He discovered that the
  sulphuret of carbon fluid had properties of transparency, freedom from color, and
  a refractive index nearly equal to flint glass. Barlow successfully created a 3-inch
  aperture telescope and later a 6-inch one, proving the feasibility of this approach.
  This method allows for increased aperture size and reduces the need for flint glass,
  offering improved light, field, and focal power in telescopes.
