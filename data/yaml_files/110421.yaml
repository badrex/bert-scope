tldr: The author, Andrew Ure, analyzed the Moira Brine Spring near Ashby-de-la-Zouch,
  Leicestershire, and its medicinal properties. The water contains bromide of sodium
  and magnesium, and protoxide of iron. Ure researched a method to extract bromine
  from the water by using chlorine gas and sulfuric ether. The resulting bromine can
  be used as a remedy for bronchocele and scrofulous tumors.
