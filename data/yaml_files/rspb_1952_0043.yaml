tldr: Researchers H. Kalmus, C. R. Ribbands, and V. B. Wigglesworth discovered that
  honeybees can distinguish their colony members by their unique odors. These odors
  help bees recognize and preferentially attract members of their own colony. The
  origin of these odors is due to metabolic differences between colonies, which can
  be influenced by factors like food supply and breeding rhythms. This study sheds
  light on the role of olfactory recognition in the social life of honeybees.
