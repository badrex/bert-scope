tldr: Female pied flycatchers prefer males with larger song repertoires and more versatile
  songs, as demonstrated through an experiment where females were given a choice between
  two males with different song qualities. This preference may be due to the correlation
  between song complexity and male quality in pied flycatchers, suggesting that females
  benefit from choosing males with complex songs.
