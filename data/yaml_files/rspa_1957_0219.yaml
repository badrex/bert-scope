tldr: The authors apply a general variational method to calculate magnetic shielding
  constants in molecules, using approximate variation functions and molecular orbital
  and valence bond wave functions. They calculate magnetic shielding constants for
  hydrogen, methane, ethylene, and acetylene, and demonstrate that the shielding constant
  for acetylene should lie between those for methane and ethylene.
