tldr: In this article, John Frederick William Herschel presents a catalogue of 629
  nebulae and clusters of stars observed in the Southern Hemisphere by James Dunlop.
  The observations were made using a 9-feet reflecting telescope, and the catalogue
  is arranged in zones based on their position and right ascension. The author also
  discusses the appearance and properties of specific nebulae, such as the nebula
  major and minor, and the dark space on the east side of the cross.
