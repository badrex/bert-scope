tldr: Dr. Josephus Laurentius Bruni investigates the Bologna Bottles, a type of glass
  that can withstand falling but breaks when small, hard objects are dropped into
  them. He conducts experiments with various materials and weights, discovering that
  roughness is a key factor in breaking the bottles. This research sheds light on
  the mechanical properties of materials and glass manufacturing techniques.
