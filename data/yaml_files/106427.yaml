tldr: The author, John Ingen-Housz, discovered a new kind of inflammable air that
  can be made without any apparatus and is as suitable for explosion as other inflammable
  gases. He also proposed a new theory of gunpowder, investigating its nature and
  explosive force. This research contributes to the understanding of chemical reactions
  and the development of explosives.
