tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the length of a pendulum in Madras,
  India, and studied the effects of temperature and altitude on its rate. The observations
  were compared to similar experiments conducted in Europe, providing valuable data
  for timekeeping and surveying. The author's detailed account of the setup and procedures
  can be useful for future researchers.
