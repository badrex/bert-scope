tldr: The authors studied the flash photolysis of nitric oxide (NO2) and observed
  the production of vibrationally excited oxygen. They found that about 20% of the
  exothermic reaction energy appears as vibrational energy in oxygen. The authors
  also investigated the mechanism for the production of superexcited oxygen and measured
  the absolute populations of the excited levels.
