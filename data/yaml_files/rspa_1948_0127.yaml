tldr: The authors develop a statistical theory of isotropic turbulence, focusing on
  the decay of turbulent motion. They introduce a similarity hypothesis that allows
  for the determination of the energy spectrum for eddies with large Reynolds numbers.
  The study also discusses the decay of turbulent motion caused by a mesh grating
  in a wind tunnel and the role of viscosity in reducing the number of degrees of
  freedom in turbulent systems.
