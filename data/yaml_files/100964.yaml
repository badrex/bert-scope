tldr: In this article, Isaac Newton defends his theory of light and colors against
  criticisms. He explains his experiments with prisms and how they demonstrated that
  white light is made up of different colors. Newton also addresses the role of reflection
  and refraction in optics and discusses the limitations of the current understanding
  of light. He argues that his theory is more plausible than the alternative hypotheses
  proposed by his critics.
