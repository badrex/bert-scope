tldr: The author conducted experiments on frog gastrocnemius muscles to study the
  effects of plurisegmental innervation on muscle fiber fatigue. They found that the
  mechanical response of the muscle fibers did not significantly differ when stimulated
  through one root versus both roots, suggesting that plurisegmental innervation may
  not play a significant role in muscle fatigue. The author also discussed alternative
  explanations for the observed discrepancies in mechanical tension development and
  proposed that the adaptive nature of muscle fibers may be a more likely factor.
