tldr: This article explores the interaction between platelets and endothelial cells,
  focusing on the role of prostacyclin in inhibiting platelet aggregation. The authors
  demonstrate that endothelial cells can synthesize prostacyclin from arachidonic
  acid, which has implications for vascular biology and understanding the mechanisms
  of blood clotting.
