tldr: The authors discuss the application of lidar technology in studying air pollution
  and chimney plumes. They describe the performance of a lidar system, its limitations,
  and improvements made to the equipment. Lidar observations have been used to predict
  pollution concentration at the ground and provide insights into plume behavior and
  environmental factors.
