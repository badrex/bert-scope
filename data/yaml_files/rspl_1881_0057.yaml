tldr: A study conducted in 1881 discovered a new form of febrile disease associated
  with the presence of an organism in the milk from the Oldmill Reformatory School
  in Aberdeen. The disease caused symptoms such as fever, headache, and swollen glands.
  The outbreak was traced back to contaminated water used in the dairy, which contained
  a large quantity of "albuminoid ammonia." The disease spread to 320 individuals,
  and the dairy's supply was stopped, leading to a decrease in new cases.
