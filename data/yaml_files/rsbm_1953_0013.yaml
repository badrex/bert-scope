tldr: Charles Halliley Kellaway was a talented Australian physiologist who made significant
  contributions to the field of physiology during his life. He served in World War
  I, where he was exposed to the effects of anoxaemia on soldiers at high altitudes.
  After the war, Kellaway conducted groundbreaking research on the effects of anoxaemia
  on the human body, focusing on blood sugar levels and the role of the brain, adrenal
  medulla, and liver cells. His work established him as a promising experimental physiologist
  and laid the foundation for further research in the field.
