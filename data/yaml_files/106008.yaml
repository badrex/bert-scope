tldr: The author, John Hunter, explores the air-filled cavities in birds and their
  connections with the lungs. He explains the unique respiratory system in birds,
  which includes air sacs in the bones and soft tissues, and how they communicate
  with the lungs. This system allows birds to have a continuous flow of oxygen, enabling
  them to breathe more efficiently than other animals.
