tldr: The author investigates the cause of variability in condensing swarms of meteorites
  and variable stars. They propose that the variability is produced by the revolution
  of one or more smaller swarms around the central swarm, with maximum luminosity
  occurring at periastron passages. This theory explains the differences in period
  and range of variability in these celestial bodies. The author further tests their
  theory by analyzing color observations and the question of irregularity in selected
  stars.
