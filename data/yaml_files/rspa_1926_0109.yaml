tldr: The authors investigated the effect of superposed alternating current on the
  polarizable primary cell zinc-sulphric acid-carbon. They discovered that high-frequency
  alternating currents do not affect the polarization of a carbon cathode charged
  with hydrogen, but they do have a significant impact on the zinc electrode, increasing
  the cell's current output. The results provide insights into the behavior of primary
  cells under alternating current and contribute to the understanding of electrode
  polarization.
