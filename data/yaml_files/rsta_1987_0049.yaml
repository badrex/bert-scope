tldr: This study investigates the behavior of stratified rotating flow over and around
  isolated three-dimensional topography. The authors conducted experiments using a
  rotating annulus apparatus and found that the flow behavior is influenced by the
  topography's shape and size. The results provide insights into the complex interactions
  between the Earth's atmosphere and ocean currents.
