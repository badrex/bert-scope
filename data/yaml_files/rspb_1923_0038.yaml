tldr: The authors compared the spinal flexor reflex and decerebrate extensor reflex,
  examining differences in their transmission, tetanus myogram curves, and the influence
  of factors such as stimulus frequency, intensity, and initial muscle stretch. They
  found that the reflexes have distinct characteristics, with the spinal reflex showing
  a more direct transmission of centripetal impulses to motoneurons and the decerebrate
  reflex involving additional motoneurons.
