tldr: This study investigates the secondary absorption edge in type Ia diamonds, focusing
  on the role of nitrogen impurities and their effects on the ultraviolet absorption.
  The authors discover that the shape and temperature dependence of the edge can be
  explained by considering vibronic progressions and uniaxial stress effects. The
  findings provide a better understanding of the properties of diamond and its defects.
