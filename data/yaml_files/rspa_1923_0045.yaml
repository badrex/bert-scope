tldr: The author presents a theory explaining the mechanism of fatigue failure in
  metals, which involves the slipping of crystals with different orientations and
  initial stresses. The model demonstrates that the fatigue range is the same as the
  elastic range, and the theory can explain most of the phenomena observed in metals
  when tested for fatigue. The limitations of the theory are discussed, and the model
  is compared to real metal test pieces.
