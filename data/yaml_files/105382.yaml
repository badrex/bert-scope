tldr: The author, Robert Symmer, conducted experiments to understand the electricity
  generated by different types of stockings. He discovered that silk and worsted stockings,
  especially when worn together, produced the most significant electrical effects.
  The author also found that the color of the stockings did not affect the electricity
  generated. These findings contributed to the understanding of the relationship between
  textiles and electricity.
