tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of radiant heat on gases
  and vapors. They discovered that the absorption of radiant heat by gases and vapors
  is the same as that of liquids, and that the expansion and contraction of these
  substances due to the absorption and release of heat can generate musical sounds.
  This research helped to disprove the "vapour-hesion" hypothesis and provided insights
  into the behavior of gases, vapors, and liquids when exposed to radiant heat.
