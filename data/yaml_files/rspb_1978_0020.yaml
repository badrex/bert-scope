tldr: The authors propose a shape representation for three-dimensional object recognition
  that uses an object-centered coordinate system, volumetric primitives of varied
  sizes, and a modular organization. They also introduce a relaxation process for
  carrying out constraint analysis in the recognition process. This representation
  is useful for deriving useful information from retinal images and can be applied
  to various recognition tasks.
