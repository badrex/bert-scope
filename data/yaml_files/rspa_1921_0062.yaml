tldr: This article investigates the evaporation from large expanses of water, focusing
  on the distribution of water vapor in an air current moving over a uniform water
  surface. The authors employ an empirical formula to represent the rate of evaporation
  and consider the effect of air speed on the evaporation process. The study has implications
  for understanding evaporation in trade wind zones, inland seas, and lakes, and can
  help estimate the amount of water evaporated from a given area under different conditions.
