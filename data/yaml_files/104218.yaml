tldr: The author describes a unique creature found in a cave in Barbados, which resembles
  a flower but exhibits animal-like characteristics. This "sensitive flower" can close
  its petals and move its "stamina" or claws, leading the author to believe it is
  an animal. The creature is found in a cave with other marine life, such as water
  bottles and blue flowers.
