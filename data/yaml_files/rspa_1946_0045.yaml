tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the shock waves produced by bursting
  diaphragms with compressed air. They used a wave-speed camera and Schlieren photography
  to analyze the movement of shock waves along a tube. The results provided an experimental
  verification of the theoretical treatment of shock waves and their properties.
