tldr: The authors investigated the magnetic properties of the hydrogen-palladium system
  and other similar systems. They found that the occluded hydrogen is not in the free
  atomic state, and the existence of molecular hydrogen in gaseous or liquid state
  would imply a smaller specific susceptibility for the active palladium. This study
  helps to understand the nature of the complex process of occlusion in these systems.
