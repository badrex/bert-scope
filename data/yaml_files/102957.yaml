tldr: Captain Stannyan observed and documented the appearance and movement of sunspots
  on the Sun's surface from May to July in 1704. He noticed that the spots moved along
  specific paths and changed shapes and sizes over time. This study provided valuable
  insights into the behavior of solar activity and the Sun's overall dynamics.
