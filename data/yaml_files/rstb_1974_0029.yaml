tldr: This study investigates the genetic distances and linguistic relationships between
  various populations in New Guinea. Researchers collected data on blood groups, serum
  proteins, and red cell enzymes from different communities and used genetic distance
  measures to analyze the results. The findings showed that linguistic and genetic
  information had a strong correlation, and the genetic distances between populations
  could be used to estimate the times of separation of related New Guinean groups.
