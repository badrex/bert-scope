tldr: The article presents a comprehensive study of the seasonal cycles and spatial
  variability in the North Sea system. A comprehensive, interdisciplinary data set
  was obtained by repeating the same cruise track in the southern North Sea at monthly
  intervals from August 1988 to October 1989. The study focused on processes such
  as temperature, salinity, suspended sediments, chlorophyll, nutrients, dissolved
  oxygen, and air-sea fluxes. The results provide valuable data for initializing and
  testing models of the North Sea's seasonal cycles and deviations from them, as well
  as for studying the processes involved.
