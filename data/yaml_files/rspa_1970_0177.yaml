tldr: This article explores the elastic-plastic behavior of polycrystalline metals
  and composites using self-consistent models based on the properties of single crystal
  constituents. The study focuses on Hill's self-consistent model, which embraces
  various accepted results for the overall properties of elastic systems. Tensile
  stress-strain curves for face-centered cubic polycrystals are presented, showing
  the effects of elastic anisotropy and hardening of the crystals. The article also
  discusses the comparison of different models and their applications in understanding
  the yield surface and stress-strain behavior at a corner of the yield surface.
