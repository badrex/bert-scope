tldr: The author, Professor Sewell, investigates the substance called the false tongue
  found in foals. He believes it is necessary for the foal's sucking action due to
  its unique respiratory system. Dr. Prout analyzes the substance, finding it to be
  composed mainly of slightly modified coagulated albumen. The author considers it
  a secretion from the foal's tongue.
