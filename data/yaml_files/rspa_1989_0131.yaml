tldr: The authors analyze the transient motion of ledged interphase boundaries, focusing
  on the growth kinetics and the role of volume diffusion of solute in the matrix.
  They present an analytical treatment using singular perturbation methods and compare
  their results with numerical simulations, providing insights into the growth behavior
  of ledged interphase boundaries.
