tldr: This article explores the dynamics of a parametrically excited pendulum, which
  exhibits various stable periodic and chaotic motions. The authors use topological
  theory to locate and predict the existence of unstable periodic orbits, which can
  then be controlled and stabilized using a simple control algorithm. This approach
  provides flexibility in achieving different periodic states by adjusting the driving
  frequency.
