tldr: The authors explain the paradoxes in dioecious fig-pollinator systems and propose
  that male and female fig trees mimic each other to attract wasps. This mutual mimicry
  ensures that wasps enter female figs and perform the necessary behaviors for pollination,
  even though it may not directly benefit them. The male fig tree imposes vicarious
  selection on the wasps, ensuring that they behave appropriately for pollination
  in both male and female figs.
