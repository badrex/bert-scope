tldr: The authors study the interaction energy of two -particles at close distances
  using anomalous scattering in helium. They explain the deviation from the classical
  Coulombian scattering law and provide a mathematical model for the potential field.
  The results can be applied to the calculation of energy binding two -particles to
  form a stable nucleus.
