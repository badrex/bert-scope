tldr: This article presents an X-ray analysis of the structure of dibenzyl using Fourier
  analysis. The authors determine the molecular dimensions, orientation, and interatomic
  distances of the molecule, finding that the benzene rings are regular plane hexagons.
  The study provides insights into the crystal structure and orientation of dibenzyl,
  contributing to the understanding of aromatic compounds.
