tldr: The study investigates the effects of adrenaline on the membrane conductance
  of the smooth muscle in the guinea-pig taenia coli. Adrenaline was found to increase
  the membrane's permeability to potassium and chloride ions, leading to hyperpolarization
  and a reduction in membrane resistance. This research provides insight into the
  complex mechanisms underlying the action of adrenaline on smooth muscle cells.
