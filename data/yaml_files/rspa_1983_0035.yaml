tldr: The authors compare experimental data on magnetic hysteresis with two phenomenological
  models. They find that the 'independent particle' model of Preisach and Everett
  accurately describes the observed behavior of minor loops in magnetic hysteresis.
  The model is further generalized to account for the interaction of particles through
  an average demagnetizing field, and a method for calculating its consequences is
  described.
