tldr: This article investigates the collision of impulsive gravitational waves when
  coupled with null dust. It explores the relationship between null dust and perfect
  fluids, showing that the transformation between the two can occur in flat space-time
  without the intervention of gravity. The study sheds light on the nature of null
  dust and its connection to perfect fluids, providing insights into the behavior
  of space-time during the collision of impulsive gravitational waves.
