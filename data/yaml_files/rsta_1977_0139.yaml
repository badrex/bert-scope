tldr: The authors present a null field approach to scalar diffraction, a method that
  can be used to solve scattering problems involving arbitrary bodies and cylindrical
  bodies. They discuss the advantages of using elliptic cylinder coordinates or spheroidal
  coordinates to reduce numerical instability and provide a detailed explanation of
  the null field equations for sound-soft and sound-hard bodies.
