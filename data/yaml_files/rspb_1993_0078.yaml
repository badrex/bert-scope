tldr: The study investigates the effects of a 15-week endurance exercise program on
  dystrophic mdx mice, focusing on the contractile properties of single skinned muscle
  fibers from the extensor digitorum longus and soleus muscles. The results show that
  endurance exercise can modify the Ca2+- and Sr2+-activated contractile characteristics
  of muscle fibers, suggesting that exercise may have potential therapeutic benefits
  for dystrophic muscle conditions.
