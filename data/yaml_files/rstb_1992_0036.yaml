tldr: The study examines the effects of selective logging on Bornean lowland forest
  birds. Most primary forest bird species were present in areas selectively logged
  eight years prior. However, certain taxa, such as flycatchers, woodpeckers, trogons,
  and wren-babblers, became comparatively rare. Nectarivorous and opportunistic frugivorous
  species were more abundant. The findings suggest that logged forests are important
  for bird conservation, but they should not be considered alternatives to primary
  forest reserves due to the susceptibility of logged forests to fire and the incomplete
  understanding of bird behavior and population dynamics in logged forests.
