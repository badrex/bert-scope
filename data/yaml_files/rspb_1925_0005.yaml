tldr: The author describes a method for estimating the amounts of amino acids, proteins,
  and their interactions with acids and alkalis. The technique involves titrating
  the substances and determining their dissociation constants to analyze their properties
  and behavior. This method provides more accurate results than previous methods and
  can be used to estimate the amounts of various amino acids and proteins in complex
  mixtures.
