tldr: The author examines the orientations of several Greek temples to determine if
  they were aligned with the rising or setting of specific stars. By understanding
  the precession of the equinoxes and how it affects the positions of stars, the author
  attempts to find the dates when these temples were founded. This research provides
  insight into the astronomical knowledge of the ancient Greeks and their connection
  to the stars.
