tldr: This article describes the meteorological observations obtained by using kites
  off the west coast of Scotland in 1902. The observations aimed to study the conditions
  of the upper air over the British Isles, which are crucial for understanding cyclonic
  disturbances. The authors conducted 71 kite ascents, with an average height of 4,200
  feet, and recorded temperature and humidity data using self-recording instruments.
  The study provided valuable information for weather forecasting and atmospheric
  science.
