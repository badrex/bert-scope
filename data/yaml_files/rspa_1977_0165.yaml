tldr: This study investigates the effects of uniaxial stress on the 2.498 eV (H4),
  2.417 eV, and 2.536 eV vibronic bands in diamond. The research establishes the H4
  center as a monoclinic I center and suggests that the molecular structures of these
  centers are similar to the commonly observed H3 center. The findings imply the existence
  of a family of closely related optical centers in type Ia diamonds.
