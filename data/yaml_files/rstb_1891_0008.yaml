tldr: This study examines the physiological effects of aromatic compounds, focusing
  on benzene and its derivatives. The authors found that these compounds primarily
  affect the spinal cord and brain, causing symptoms similar to certain diseases of
  the spinal cord in humans. They also observed differences in the actions of various
  members of the benzene group, which they attribute to differences in their chemical
  structure. The research was conducted using rats and frogs, with experiments performed
  on their spinal cords, nerves, and muscles.
