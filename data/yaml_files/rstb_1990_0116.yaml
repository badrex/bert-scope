tldr: This study examines the palynology of interglacial deposits at Little Oakley,
  Essex, and their correlation to other sites in Britain and neighboring countries.
  The research provides evidence of the vegetational development during temperate
  stages in northwest Europe, with a focus on the early middle Pleistocene interglacial
  deposits. The findings contribute to the understanding of the Cromerian sensu stricto
  and the late Beestonian periods.
