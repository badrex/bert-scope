tldr: This study examines Pleistocene deposits at Earnley, Bracklesham Bay, Sussex,
  analyzing pollen, diatoms, foraminifers, molluscs, and ostracods from a channel
  filling of marine sediments. The findings indicate a mixed coniferous and deciduous
  forest during the period of the channel filling, and the sediments suggest shallow
  marine conditions at the base and intertidal conditions higher in the sequence.
  The age of the channel filling is discussed, suggesting it is older than the Ipswichian
  and may be late Hoxnian or late Cromerian in age.
