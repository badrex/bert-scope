tldr: 'The authors investigate the turnover and proliferation of macrophages in inflamed
  connective tissue. They discover that macrophages in inflammatory reactions can
  be categorized into three types: newly arrived from circulation, a high turnover
  pool dependent on bone marrow recruitment, and a self-sufficient population independent
  of further marrow recruitment. The study provides insights into the complex process
  of macrophage proliferation and turnover in different types of inflammation.'
