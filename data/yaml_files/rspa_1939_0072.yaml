tldr: The authors investigated the electron transfer process in argon gas, where a
  singly-charged ion collides with a normal atom, transferring an electron and creating
  a neutral atom and a singly-charged ion. They found that the energy spread of the
  fast ions resulting from the electron transfer process can be fully accounted for
  by the energy spread in the incident ions for certain energy ranges, indicating
  that the angles involved in the process have definite values. This study helps to
  understand the behavior of ions and atoms in gas discharges and plasma physics.
