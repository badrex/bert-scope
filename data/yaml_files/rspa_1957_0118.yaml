tldr: This article presents explicit equations for calculating the equilibrium gas
  compositions at high temperatures using successive approximations. The author demonstrates
  the method for the hydrogen-carbon-oxygen and hydrogen-carbon-oxygen-nitrogen systems
  without solid carbon formation. The approach is simple, quick, and can be used mechanically
  by an unskilled computer, making it a valuable tool for calculating gas compositions
  in various conditions.
