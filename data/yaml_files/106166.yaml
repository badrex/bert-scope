tldr: The author, M. J. A. de Luc, developed a new method for measuring humidity using
  a hygrometer. He discovered that water is the key to understanding humidity and
  its effects on various surfaces and materials. By using water at the point where
  it turns from ice to liquid, de Luc established a fixed point for the hygrometer,
  which became the basis for his hygrometrical scale. This new approach to measuring
  humidity provided a more accurate and reliable method for understanding the moisture
  content in the air and its impact on various phenomena.
