tldr: This study investigates the ultrastructural localization of acetylcholinesterase
  and nonspecific cholinesterase activity in ox adrenal medulla using cytochemical
  methods. The findings reveal that acetylcholinesterase activity occurs in both splanchnic
  nerve and chromaffin cells, with reaction end-products found at various sites, including
  around axons, within axonal endoplasmic reticulum, and between nerve terminals and
  chromaffin cells. These observations raise the question of whether the released
  acetylcholinesterase from the perfused adrenal gland originates from the endoplasmic
  reticula of splanchnic nerve and/or chromaffin cells.
