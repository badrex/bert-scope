tldr: Researchers injected messenger RNA (mRNA) extracted from the electric organ
  of Torpedo into Xenopus oocytes, leading to the synthesis and incorporation of functional
  acetylcholine receptors into the oocyte membrane. These receptors resembled nicotinic
  receptors found in other cells and responded to acetylcholine. This discovery demonstrated
  that foreign mRNA coding for acetylcholine receptor proteins can be translated in
  the oocyte, processed, and inserted into the membrane, forming a functional receptor-channel
  complex.
