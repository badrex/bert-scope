tldr: This article discusses insect leg development, pattern regulation, and regeneration,
  focusing on the polar coordinate model. It explains how insect legs develop from
  small regions of the embryonic thorax and how they differentiate in the embryo to
  form functional larval legs. The article also explores the process of pattern regulation
  and regeneration in insect legs, as well as the molecular mechanisms that may underlie
  a polar map of positional information.
