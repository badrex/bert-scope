tldr: The article discusses the challenges in assessing the sublethal effects of pollutants
  in the sea and the need for better techniques to measure these effects. It highlights
  the limitations of laboratory experiments and the importance of considering environmental
  variables in assessing the impact of pollutants on marine life. The author suggests
  that future research should focus on improving the assessment of recovery processes
  and exploring the potential benefits of some substances classified as pollutants.
