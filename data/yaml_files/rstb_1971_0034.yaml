tldr: This article discusses the advantages and limitations of high-voltage electron
  microscopy in biology, focusing on the increased specimen penetration and improved
  image resolution. It also explores the challenges of contrast decrease and response
  of viewing screens and photographic emulsions at higher voltages. The article outlines
  the potential applications of high-voltage microscopy in examining living organisms
  and thick specimens, as well as the differences in construction and operation between
  high-voltage and standard electron microscopes.
