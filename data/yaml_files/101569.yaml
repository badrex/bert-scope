tldr: The author, Dr. Ezerel Tonge, investigates the factors affecting the bleeding
  of walnuts and the movement of sap in trees. He discusses the influence of temperature,
  moon phases, tree age, and size on sap flow. Tonge also suggests conducting further
  experiments to understand the role of atmospheric pressure and the effect of sealing
  a cut root in glass.
