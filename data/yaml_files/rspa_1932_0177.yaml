tldr: The authors conducted experiments with oxychlorides of sulfur to study their
  dipole moments and molecular structure. They found that the semi-polar sulfur-oxygen
  linkages in these compounds lead to high dipole moments. The authors also compared
  the electric moments in oxychlorides and other sulfur-containing compounds, highlighting
  the differences in their molecular structures and bonding.
