tldr: The author conducted an experiment to study the color change of a liquid when
  exposed to air. They discovered that the liquid, made from copper filings and urine,
  turned blue upon exposure to air. The author applied this phenomenon to the study
  of blood, suggesting that the color change in blood is due to the influence of air
  and respiration. This challenges the prevailing theories of the time that attributed
  the change to other factors.
