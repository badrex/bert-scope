tldr: This article explores the role of land crabs in the Aldabran ecosystem. These
  crabs play a significant part in energy transfer between land and sea, preventing
  colonization by exotic plant species, and aiding in leaf litter breakdown. They
  also contribute to soil aeration and provide habitats for other animals. The article
  highlights the various ways land crabs impact the Aldabran ecosystem, including
  their scavenging and herbivorous behaviors.
