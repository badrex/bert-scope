revised_title: Aerodynamics of Animal Flight in Ground Effect

semantic_tags:

tldr: The article discusses the aerodynamics of animal flight in ground effect, focusing
  on the reduction in induced drag and the potential performance improvements it offers.
  A complete lifting line theory of flight in ground effect is developed, and predictions
  are made about the flight behavior and appropriate flight morphology for animals
  taking advantage of these performance improvements.
