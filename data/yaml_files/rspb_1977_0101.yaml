tldr: This study examines the distribution and adaptation of B chromosomes in White
  Spruce. B2 chromosomes are found in western regions, while B1 is found in both western
  and eastern regions. The frequency of B chromosomes varies, and experimental results
  suggest that this variation is adaptive and influenced by differential mortality
  in specific environments. Evidence indicates that B2 was introduced to White Spruce
  through hybridization with Engelmann Spruce.
