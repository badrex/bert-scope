tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the maximum rate of the action
  potential upstroke and membrane properties, particularly the sodium conductance.
  The authors use simplified analytical models to explore the effects of the leak
  conductance, sodium current activation time, and sodium current inactivation time
  on this relationship. The results suggest that the maximum rate of rise of the action
  potential is unlikely to be proportional to the maximum sodium conductance, except
  under specific circumstances.
