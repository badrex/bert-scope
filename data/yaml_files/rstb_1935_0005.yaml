tldr: This study examines the reproductive processes of the Common Shrew, focusing
  on the oestrous cycle and pregnancy. The author collected and analyzed data from
  1,064 shrews, with 487 being females. The research provides insights into the shrew's
  reproductive habits, including the effect of lactation on implantation, duration
  of pregnancy, and transference of embryos between uterine cornua. The study also
  highlights the challenges of trapping female shrews during the onset of their first
  oestrus in spring.
