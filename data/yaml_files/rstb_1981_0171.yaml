tldr: This article discusses the process of exocytosis, where secretory cells release
  their contents to the extracellular space by fusing with the plasma membrane. The
  article also explores the concept of membrane recycling, where the membrane from
  secretory granules is taken up and reused within the cell. The process of exocytosis
  and recycling helps control the size and specificity of the cell surface. The article
  highlights the importance of understanding the recognition mechanisms between granule
  and plasma membranes in the exo-endocytotic cycle.
