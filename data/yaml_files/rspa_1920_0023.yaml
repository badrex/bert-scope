tldr: The authors developed a new method of spectrophotometry to measure the absorption
  of light by silver bromide, a key component in photographic film. They used a simple
  setup with a wedge-shaped silver bromide sample and a spectroscope to compare the
  light intensities before and after passing through the sample. This method allowed
  them to determine the extinction coefficient of silver bromide, which is important
  for understanding its photochemical properties and improving photographic film technology.
