tldr: The authors investigate the number of orbits in a variety associated with Dynkin
  graphs of type A. They show that there is only a finite number of indecomposable
  representations in up to isomorphism for certain cases, while for others, there
  exist infinitely many orbits. The study provides insights into the structure of
  indecomposable representations in these graphs.
