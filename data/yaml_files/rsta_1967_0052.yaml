tldr: This article explores the Lagrange problem in the calculus of variations, focusing
  on finding geodesic arcs that minimize the integral. The author introduces the concept
  of a parabolic structure on differentiable manifolds and studies the exponential
  map to understand the behavior of these structures. The article proves several theorems
  related to the Lagrange problem and provides insights into approximating geodesic
  arcs using Morse theory.
