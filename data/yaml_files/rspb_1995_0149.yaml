tldr: This study examines sperm precedence in domestic fowl and investigates the displacement
  hypothesis. The researchers found no significant last-male sperm precedence and
  their results did not differ significantly from the passive sperm loss model. The
  study's findings challenge previous research suggesting a strong last-male precedence
  effect in domestic fowl and provide insights into the factors that determine the
  outcome of sperm competition in birds.
