tldr: This article discusses the complexity of relations between human health and
  the geochemical environment. It emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary efforts,
  including collaboration between chemists, geologists, nutritionists, epidemiologists,
  and physicians. The authors highlight the need for more work on chemical speciation
  in rocks, soils, waters, and plant materials, as well as joint planning between
  geochemists and health specialists. They also suggest the importance of conducting
  combined epidemiological and geochemical studies in developing countries to gather
  valuable base-line data.
