tldr: The authors studied the formation and destruction of pentenes during the combustion
  of pentane. They found that pentenes are initial and direct products of pentane
  combustion, with pent-2-ene being the principal conjugate alkene formed. The authors
  used isotopic tracer techniques to determine the separate rates of formation and
  destruction of pentenes, providing a more accurate understanding of the role of
  pentenes in pentane combustion.
