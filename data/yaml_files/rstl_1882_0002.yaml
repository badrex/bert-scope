tldr: The author examines the electromotive properties of the Dionaea leaf in both
  excited and unexcited states. They discuss recent research on plant electricity
  and explore the distribution of electrical tension on the leaf's surface. The study
  also investigates the electrical phenomena resulting from excitation and the mechanisms
  behind the leaf's movement.
