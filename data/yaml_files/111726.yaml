tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of sulphuric acid by pentachloride
  of phosphorus and discovers a new compound called chloro-hydrated sulphuric acid.
  This compound is formed by replacing one atom of hydrogen and one of oxygen from
  the acid with an atom of chlorine. The author also finds that this compound can
  be used to create chlorides of other inorganic acid radicals.
