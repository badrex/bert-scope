tldr: The authors conducted experiments on muscles poisoned with mono-iodo-acetic
  acid (IAA) to study the recovery heat in muscular contraction without lactic acid
  formation. They found that a normal amount of recovery heat can occur after a short
  tetanus in a muscle not too heavily poisoned. The recovery heat production rate
  was slower in IAA-poisoned muscles compared to normal muscles, indicating that IAA
  interferes with respiration, though to a lesser extent than lactic acid formation.
