tldr: The article investigates the boundary layer flow of a viscous, electrically
  conducting liquid near a semi-infinite flat plate, considering an adverse magneto-dynamic
  pressure gradient. The study extends the Falkner-Skan problem to an electrically
  conducting liquid and examines the viscous stress at the plate and critical values
  of parameters. The results provide insights into the behavior of the flow and the
  influence of an adverse magneto-dynamic pressure gradient.
