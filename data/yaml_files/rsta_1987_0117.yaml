tldr: This paper presents further developments in a nonlinear theory of water waves
  for finite and infinite depths. The authors establish a 1-1 correspondence between
  the Lagrangian and Eulerian formulations of the integral balance laws of a general
  thermomechanical theory of directed fluid sheets. Applications are made to incompressible
  inviscid fluids of infinite and finite depths, with a focus on a wedge-like boat.
  The study provides new insights into the behavior of water waves and their practical
  applications.
