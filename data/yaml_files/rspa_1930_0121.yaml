tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of a monomolecular hydrogen
  layer on the efficiency of molecular collisions. They found that the accommodation
  coefficient, which measures the thermal efficiency of collisions, decreases slightly
  when the surface is covered by a layer of hydrogen atoms. This suggests that the
  main mechanism of energy exchange between gas and solid in this case is elastic
  collision.
