tldr: The authors investigate the propagation of radio waves of very low frequency
  through the ionosphere, treating it as a wave-guide. They discover that for frequencies
  greater than about 30, some modes are possible where the energy is concentrated
  near the base of the ionosphere, and the field strength near the ground is small.
  These modes are called 'whispering gallery modes' and are useful for understanding
  the behavior of radio waves in the ionosphere.
