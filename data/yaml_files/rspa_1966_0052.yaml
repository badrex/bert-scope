tldr: Researchers developed a new ultra-long period seismometer operating in a vacuum
  to study the Earth's free and forced oscillations. The device uses photoelectric
  detection for tele-recording, amplification, and filtering. The seismometer's improved
  design allows for better noise reduction and more accurate analysis of long period
  seismic waves, particularly from the Alaska earthquake in 1964.
