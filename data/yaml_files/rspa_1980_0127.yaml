tldr: The study investigates the interaction between a plane sound wave and a Blasius
  boundary layer in incompressible flow. A spectral numerical method is used to analyze
  the two-dimensional unsteady flow over a flat plate in the presence of a plane sound
  wave. The results show that a Tollmien-Schlichting wave is generated with the same
  frequency as the sound wave, and the interaction occurs near the leading edge. The
  findings can aid in understanding how free-stream disturbances may affect boundary-layer
  transition.
