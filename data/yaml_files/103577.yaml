tldr: The author describes a new method for bending planks in shipbuilding using a
  sand-heat process invented by Captain Cumberland. This method softens the wood,
  allowing it to be easily bent and adapted to various shipbuilding shapes. It preserves
  the edges of the plank, resulting in a stronger and more durable structure. This
  technique is more efficient and cost-effective than previous methods, such as burning
  planks over an open fire.
