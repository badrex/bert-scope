tldr: This study investigates the effects of prolonged exposure to low-intensity light
  on the Norway lobster's photoreceptors. The visual pigment of the Norway lobster
  was found to change into a long-lived photoproduct upon exposure to light, causing
  the structural stability of the rhabdoms to degrade. The researchers discovered
  that even a short exposure to light could cause complete rhabdom degeneration within
  24 hours, suggesting that this type of degeneration might be induced in other "dim
  light" species with low rates of pigment regeneration.
