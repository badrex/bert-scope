tldr: This article presents a component design-based model for the deformation and
  rupture of tough fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites. The model is based
  on a single damage state parameter and accounts for fiber failure, debonding, and
  fiber pull-out. It aims to help in designing components with high strength, toughness,
  and resistance to environmental factors.
