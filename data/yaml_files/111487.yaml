tldr: The author, A. W. Hofmann, researched a new ammonia derivative, which he called
  a poly-ammonia. He discovered that this compound, formed by the substitution of
  molecules in aniline, is insoluble in water but dissolves in alcohol and ether.
  The new base forms crystalline compounds with acids and has a chemical formula of
  C26H12N2. Further study is needed to understand its properties and changes.
