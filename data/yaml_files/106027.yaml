tldr: The author presents specimens of native salts collected from coal-mines near
  Whitehaven and discusses their formation, properties, and potential uses. He describes
  the process of salt germination and the growth of crystals, as well as the decay
  of stones in coal-mines due to the presence of these salts. The author also compares
  the properties of these native salts to those found in other sources, such as Epsom
  salt and Scarborough salt.
