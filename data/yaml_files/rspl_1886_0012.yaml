tldr: This article discusses the Clark cell as a standard of electromotive force and
  its various modes of preparation. It explores the factors affecting the accuracy
  of the electromotive force, such as temperature, liquid saturation, and the purity
  of materials. The author compares the Clark cells with Daniells and provides recommendations
  for their usage in practical applications.
