tldr: This article explores the theoretical chemistry of the 7p series of superheavy
  elements using the relativistic molecular orbital and Kappa Valence methods. The
  authors investigate the bonding and properties of these elements, providing insights
  into their atomic and molecular structures. The study contributes to the understanding
  of superheavy elements and their potential applications in various fields.
