tldr: The authors present a general derivation of the electron energy distribution
  function in a uniform electric field, considering both elastic and inelastic collisions
  with gas molecules. They use the Jeffreys method to solve the equilibrium equation
  for the electron population and derive an equation relating the Townsend ionization
  coefficient to the properties of the gas. The theory is illustrated with calculations
  for hydrogen, showing good agreement with experimental observations.
