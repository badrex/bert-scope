tldr: This article investigates the visual perception of fine detail and color vision,
  focusing on the mechanisms that help the human eye process and improve the image
  formed on the retina before it reaches the brain. The author examines various factors
  affecting visual acuity, color perception, and the role of chromatic aberration
  in the eye. The study also explores the potential for improving vision through correcting
  chromatic dispersion and the impact of different colored lights on visual acuity.
