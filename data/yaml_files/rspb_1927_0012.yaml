tldr: The study investigates the effects of ovarian hormones on the development of
  pro-oestrous and oestrous stages in dogs and rabbits. The results show that injections
  of follicular extract cause the development of a stratified vaginal epithelium,
  similar to that observed during oestrus. The study also highlights the impact of
  these hormones on the uterus, causing congestion and glandular growth. However,
  the injections did not affect the follicular system of the ovary in the anoestrous
  bitches.
