tldr: This study investigates the two-stage auto-ignition process of hydrocarbons
  and its connection to "knock" in internal combustion engines. The research focuses
  on the effects of increased initial pressure on the induction lags prior to ignition,
  using propane and propylene as examples. The findings have practical implications
  for understanding and improving engine performance.
