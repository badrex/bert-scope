tldr: This article discusses the first and second viscosities of fluids and their
  relationship with hydrodynamic and thermodynamic pressures. The author presents
  equations to express the rheological equations of state and explores the connection
  between hydrodynamic pressure and static pressure in thermodynamics. The article
  also examines the different approaches to explain excess absorption of sound energy,
  such as the relaxation theory, molecular structure theory, and second viscosity
  theory.
