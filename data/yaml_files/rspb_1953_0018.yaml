tldr: The authors discuss the structure of collagen proteins, analyzing their physical
  and chemical properties, and examining the various models proposed for their structure.
  They argue that none of the existing models are consistent with all the features
  of collagen, and propose a new model based on planar trans amide groups. This model
  accounts for the 2-86A meridional spacing and the 1-75 perpendicular dichroism observed
  in the N-H stretching frequency. The authors emphasize the need for further research
  on collagen proteins, including biochemical analysis and investigation of the effects
  of salts and large molecules on their precipitation.
