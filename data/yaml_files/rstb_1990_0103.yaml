tldr: The authors studied the crystal structures of two forms of deamino-oxytocin,
  a hormone analogue, and found different conformations in the 'dry' and 'wet' forms.
  The research helps understand the hormone's activity and its relation to other neurohypophyseal
  hormones. The findings can aid in the design of synthetic hormone analogues with
  improved potency and selectivity.
