tldr: This article investigates the consumption of carbon in electric arcs, focusing
  on the anode loss. The authors found that the anode loss is less important in the
  mechanism of the arc, and the main function of the anode is to receive the carriers
  of the current produced by the essential process occurring at the surface of the
  cathode. The study also discusses the factors responsible for the formation of the
  crater on the anode and not on the cathode.
