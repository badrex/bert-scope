tldr: The author investigates the sign and magnitude of electric discharges in lightning
  flashes, using a method that measures sudden changes in the vertical electric field.
  They discuss the electric moments of lightning discharges and how these changes
  can be used to determine the transfer of electrical charges between the atmosphere
  and the earth. This research helps to understand the role of lightning in the balance
  of electrical charges between the atmosphere and the earth's surface.
