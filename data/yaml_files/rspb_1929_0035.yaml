tldr: 'The author conducted experiments to measure the heat production in stimulated
  crab and lobster nerves and found that the heat production can be separated into
  two phases: initial and recovery. The study also showed that the nerves'' ability
  to recover is dependent on oxygen supply, as without oxygen, the nerve remains "discharged."'
