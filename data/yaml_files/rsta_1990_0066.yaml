tldr: The article investigates the effects of background rotation and density stratification
  on fluid flow past a circular cylinder. Experiments were conducted in a rotating
  tow tank, and various flow visualization techniques were used to study the flow
  patterns. The results show that rapid background rotation causes separation and
  vortex shedding at higher Reynolds numbers and forms an asymmetrical wake flow with
  cyclonic eddies dominating their anticyclonic counterparts. The presence of rotation
  also leads to strong steering of the upper-level flow by the bottom topography,
  known as the Taylor column effect.
