tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study neutron collisions with light nuclei,
  such as nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon, using an expansion chamber and stereoscopic
  photography. They found that most neutrons emitted from beryllium bombarded by alpha
  particles from polonium have energies less than 4.6x10^6 electron volts. The results
  suggest that a real feature of the energy spectrum of emitted neutrons is in question,
  possibly involving a continuous distribution with energy or a prominent group of
  neutrons with energies between 2x10^6 electron volts.
