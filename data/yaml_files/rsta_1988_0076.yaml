tldr: Panelists discuss the role of chemical evidence in testing the credibility of
  physical models of the Solar System's origin. The planetary collision hypothesis,
  which explains various features of asteroids, meteorites, and comets, is proposed
  as a plausible alternative to the nebula theory. The hypothesis accounts for isotopic
  anomalies, the formation of chondrules, and the rapid heating and cooling observed
  in the early Solar System.
