tldr: The authors developed an apparatus using the crossed-beam technique to measure
  the ionization cross-section of helium ions by electron impact. They found that
  the cross-section for helium ions is similar to that of atomic hydrogen but increases
  more rapidly near the threshold. The results agree well with the Coulomb-Born approximation
  at high electron energies.
