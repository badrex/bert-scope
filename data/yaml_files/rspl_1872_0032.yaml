tldr: This article examines the composition and origin of the waters of a salt spring
  in Huel Seton Mine, Cornwall, and investigates the surrounding rocks. The author
  suggests that the salt spring may be a result of sea water infiltrating through
  faults and interacting with the local geology, leading to the formation of various
  minerals and salts.
