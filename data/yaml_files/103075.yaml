tldr: The author describes the discovery of several nebulae or luminous spots in the
  sky, visible only through a telescope. These spots appear as small, bright patches
  or clouds and are found among fixed stars. The author discusses six such nebulae,
  their locations, and their possible vast sizes, suggesting that they may occupy
  spaces as large as our solar system. These discoveries raise questions about the
  nature of these celestial objects and the possibility of perpetual daylight within
  them.
