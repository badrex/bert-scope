tldr: The article investigates the rectal complex in the larvae of Lepidoptera, focusing
  on Pieris brassicae and Manduca sexta. It explains how the rectal complex helps
  maintain salt balance under heavy dietary loading and contributes to the removal
  of water from the faeces. The rectal complex plays a significant role in the excretory
  system of these larvae, and the study provides insights into the mechanisms involved.
