tldr: The authors developed a method called anchored polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
  to isolate telomere junction fragments from human DNA. They found that these fragments
  contain a mix of telomeric and subtelomeric sequences, providing insights into the
  structure and function of chromosome ends. This method can be used to study telomere-associated
  sequences and their role in chromosome maintenance and evolution.
