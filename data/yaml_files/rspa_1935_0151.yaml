tldr: The authors conducted experiments with tin spheres to study the behavior of
  magnetic fields in supraconducting materials. They discovered that when a material
  becomes supraconducting, the magnetic lines of force are expelled from the material,
  challenging the "frozen-in" lines of force theory. The results showed that the magnetic
  dipoles in the spheres decreased as the temperature increased, supporting the idea
  that the permeability of a supraconductor is zero, and parts of the material remain
  non-supraconducting below the transition temperature.
