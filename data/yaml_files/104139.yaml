tldr: The author, Richard Mead, presents a method to improve air quality in ships
  by using the natural elasticity of air. By creating a rarefaction of air in the
  ship's hold and connecting it to a copper boiling-place, the foul air is drawn out
  and replaced with fresh air, improving the health of sailors on board.
