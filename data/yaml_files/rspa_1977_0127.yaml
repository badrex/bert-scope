tldr: The article investigates the linear and nonlinear stabilities of a horizontal
  layer of an elasticoviscous fluid, using Oldroyd's stress-rate-of-strain relations.
  The study focuses on the effects of the Prandtl number, Rayleigh number, and adiabatic
  temperature gradient on the fluid's behavior. The results show that steady convection
  is preferred for all relevant values of the Prandtl number, and plane disturbances
  govern the evolution of the fluid in both linear and nonlinear cases. The adiabatic
  temperature gradient stabilizes the layer in the linear theory but can destabilize
  it in the nonlinear theory under certain conditions.
