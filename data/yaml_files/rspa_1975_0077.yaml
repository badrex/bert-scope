tldr: The authors study the effect of excluded volume on polymer dispersant action,
  modeling polymer-stabilized colloid particles with plane surfaces and polymer chains
  adsorbed by one end only. They find that excluded volume significantly increases
  the repulsive free energy, especially at large separation distances of the surfaces,
  playing a crucial role in the stabilization of colloids by adsorbed polymer.
