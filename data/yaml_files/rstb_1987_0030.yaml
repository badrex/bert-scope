tldr: This article investigates the relationship between wing morphology, flight performance,
  and foraging strategy in bats. It explores how selective pressures for different
  modes of flight have led to various wing adaptations in bats, such as agility, speed,
  and maneuverability. The study also examines the connection between flight morphology
  and echolocation, demonstrating that these adaptations are closely linked due to
  the joint constraints of flying and locating food in different ways.
