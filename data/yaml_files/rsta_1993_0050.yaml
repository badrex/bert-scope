tldr: This study examines the late Quaternary eruptions and stratigraphy of Taupo
  Volcano in New Zealand, identifying 28 eruptions that post-date the Oruanui eruption.
  The deposits of these eruptions reveal a wide range of eruption volumes, styles,
  and repose periods, making it difficult to predict the time and size of future eruptions.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the volcanic activity and the central
  Taupo Volcanic Zone's longer-term activity patterns.
