tldr: The author, George Knox, conducted experiments to determine the presence of
  bitumen in various types of stones. Through distillation and ignition processes,
  he found that bitumen exists in several stones, including Pitch-stone, Basalt, Green-stone,
  and Wacke. The study also revealed the formation of pumice and the potential role
  of bitumen in the natural formation of pumice. The author did not support any specific
  theory but shared his findings and methods for future research.
