tldr: This study by J. L. Jinks and K. Mather examines the stability in development
  of heterozygotes and homozygotes in various species. They found that heterozygotes
  generally show less variation and have greater stability in development than homozygotes.
  This can be attributed to the action of natural selection in outbreeding populations,
  which favors heterozygous genotypes. The authors argue that greater stability in
  development is a result of genic balance and not a characteristic of the heterozygotic
  state itself. They also discuss the implications of these findings for understanding
  the genetic structure and response to selection in both wild and domesticated populations.
