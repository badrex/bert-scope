tldr: The author analyzes modifiable synapses and classifies them into three categories
  based on their properties and how they can be used in models for classical and operant
  conditioning. The study shows that different classes of modifiable synapses can
  replace each other in a neural network, and discusses the implications for understanding
  memory mechanisms in the nervous system.
