tldr: The study compared the virulence of lice and mites infesting rock doves, finding
  that horizontally transmitted mites had a significant negative impact on host reproductive
  success, while vertically transmitted lice had no detectable effect. This supports
  the hypothesis that ectoparasite virulence is linked to the mode of transmission.
