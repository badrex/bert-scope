tldr: This article recounts the life and career of Henry Solomon Lipson, a pioneering
  physicist and crystallographer. Born in Liverpool to immigrant parents, Lipson overcame
  challenging circumstances to pursue a successful career in physics. He studied at
  Liverpool University, where he worked on crystal structures using X-ray diffraction
  under the guidance of Arnold Beevers. Lipson and Beevers faced numerous challenges,
  including the lack of proper equipment and limited resources, but their determination
  led to significant breakthroughs in crystallography. Their work at Manchester University,
  under the guidance of Lawrence Bragg, resulted in the successful solution of several
  crystal structures, including beryllium sulphate tetrahydrate and nickel sulphate
  hexahydrate. Lipson's achievements in physics education and research left a lasting
  impact on the field of crystallography.
