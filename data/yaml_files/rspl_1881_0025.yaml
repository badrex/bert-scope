tldr: The author describes a successful case of inter-human osseous transplantation,
  where over two-thirds of a humerus shaft was restored. The author discusses previous
  attempts and experiments in bone transplantation, and suggests that bone can grow
  after transplantation and potentially provide practical results. The study highlights
  the importance of understanding the elements of bone best suited for transplantation
  and the need for proper blood supply to ensure successful transplantation.
