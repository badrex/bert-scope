tldr: The author discusses the advancements in optical fibre communication technology,
  from the initial development of low attenuation fibre and long-lived semiconductor
  lasers to the second-generation single-mode systems entering service. They examine
  the future possibilities and limitations of optical fibre systems, including attenuation
  mechanisms, dispersion, and nonlinear effects. The paper also explores various fibre
  designs, cable techniques, and operational planning for future land and undersea
  cable systems.
