revised_title: Studies on the Properties and Selectivity of Lipase Enzymes
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry
semantic_tags:
- Enzyme action
- Lipase
- Fatty acid hydrolysis
- Ricinus lipase
- Castor oil
tldr: This article investigates the action of lipase enzymes, specifically Ricinus
  lipase found in castor oil plants. The author discovers that this enzyme requires
  an acidic environment to function and acts preferentially on natural fats. The study
  also compares the action of animal lipase on various ethereal salts and natural
  fats, highlighting the differences in their selectivity and properties.
