tldr: This article investigates the origin of continental flood basalts, focusing
  on the Snake River Plain in Idaho, USA. The authors analyze the geochemical and
  isotopic evidence to determine the relative contributions of mantle, oceanic crust,
  and continental crust to magma genesis. They find that the enriched spinel herzolite
  mantle, containing at least a component of 2.5 Ga material, is the primary source
  for the tholeiitic melts. The authors also evaluate the role of crustal contamination
  and fractional crystallization in the evolution of these magmas.
