tldr: The authors apply the phase integral method to analyze the diffraction and refraction
  of wireless waves around the Earth. They extend Watson's original analysis to consider
  the finite conductivity of the Earth and the effect of elevated transmitters and
  receivers. The phase integral method provides a solution to the problem and can
  be extended to account for the gradient of refractive index in the atmosphere above
  the Earth.
