tldr: Joseph Toynbee's study examines the muscles responsible for opening the Eustachian
  tube and their role in the process of swallowing. He concludes that the Eustachian
  tubes are closed during normal hearing and that the act of swallowing opens the
  tubes, allowing air to enter the middle ear. Toynbee also discusses the differences
  in Eustachian tube muscles and functions in various animals and debunks the analogy
  between the tympanum and musical instruments that require open air chambers.
