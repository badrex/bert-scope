tldr: The article discusses the calculation of primary trajectories of seeds and other
  particles in strong winds, focusing on smooth spherical particles. The author presents
  a hybrid analytical-empirical law to describe the aerodynamic resistance to motion
  experienced by these particles, allowing for the numerical integration of the equations
  of motion and providing universal range tables for estimating dispersal distances.
  The study also explores the effects of pseudo-thermal convection on particle movement
  and deposition concentration.
