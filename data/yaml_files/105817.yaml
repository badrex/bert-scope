tldr: The author, Samuel Horsley, revisits the computation of the Sun's distance from
  Earth using the theory of gravity. He discusses the precision required in determining
  the solar force affecting the moon's gravity towards the Earth. Horsley finds that
  by adjusting the mean quantity of the Sun's disturbing force, he obtains a more
  accurate estimation of the Sun's mean horizontal parallax, which is close to the
  mean of the parallax deduced from the best observations of the transit of 1761.
