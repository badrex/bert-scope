tldr: The authors studied the effects of high calcium solutions on the sensitivity
  of crayfish muscle fibres to glutamate. They found that exposure to high calcium
  solutions damaged nerve terminals, decreased junctional potentials, and significantly
  reduced the sensitivity to glutamate compared to control muscles. The sensitivity
  to y-aminobutyric acid, the putative transmitter at inhibitory synapses, was increased.
  This research provides insights into the complex relationship between nerve terminal
  damage and the decrease in sensitivity to glutamate.
