tldr: This study examines the limited MHC polymorphism in southern elephant seals
  and its implications for MHC evolution and marine mammal population biology. The
  research shows that two populations of southern elephant seals have low DNA restriction
  fragment length polymorphism at MHC loci compared to terrestrial mammals. This low
  polymorphism cannot be explained by low genome-wide diversity or reproductive-based
  selection pressure. Instead, it can be explained by diminished exposure to pathogenic
  selection pressure compared to terrestrial mammals, which may make marine mammal
  populations more susceptible to occasional pathogen-induced mass mortalities.
