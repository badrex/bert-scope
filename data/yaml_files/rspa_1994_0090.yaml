tldr: The authors study the linear instability of a Rankine vortex in a compressible
  fluid within a compliant tube. They find that the vortex is unstable to all modes
  of disturbance and that the deformation increases indefinitely due to energy removal
  from the vortex. The results demonstrate the importance of the interaction between
  the vortex and the compliant tube boundary in the instability mechanism.
