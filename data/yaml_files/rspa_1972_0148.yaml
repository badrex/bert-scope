tldr: The authors studied the interaction of oblique shock waves with yawed wedges,
  focusing on the pressure distribution on the wedge surface. They developed an analytic
  solution for the flow field and used conformal transformations to solve the problem.
  Numerical results were obtained for a pair of incident shock strengths, providing
  quantitative estimates of the pressure distribution.
