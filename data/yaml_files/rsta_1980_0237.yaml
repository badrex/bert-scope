tldr: This article discusses the chemical composition of energetic charged particles
  in interplanetary space, focusing on the Sun's role as a primary source. It reviews
  the particle population, the chemical composition of charged particles, and the
  composition below and above 100 nucleon energies. The article also explores the
  anomalous component, interplanetary active regions, and the effects of shocks on
  charged particles.
