tldr: This study investigates the relationship between the color of the larva of Smerinthus
  ocellatus and its food plants. The author found that the larval color is affected
  by the food plant, but there are exceptions that need to be explained. The author
  also tested the hypothesis that the influence of the food plant on larval color
  is complex, involving the color of the leaf acting as a stimulus to the larval sensory
  surface, which then regulates the absorption and deposition of pigments.
