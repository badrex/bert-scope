tldr: The authors describe a selective hot-wire microphone that can detect specific
  sounds in the presence of others and estimate the relative intensities of sounds
  with the same pitch. The instrument, which uses a Helmholtz resonator with a platinum
  wire grid, is sensitive to low-pitched sounds and can be used for various applications,
  including sound distribution analysis, sound diffraction studies, and harmonic intensity
  estimation. The authors also discuss the advantages of the hot-wire microphone over
  traditional diaphragm-based instruments.
