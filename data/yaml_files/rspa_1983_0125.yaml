tldr: The authors propose a new theory for explaining relaxation phenomena in imperfect
  materials, such as solids and liquids. They introduce a cluster approach that considers
  the structural organization of macroscopic samples and the steady-state distribution
  of clusters. This model helps to understand the dynamics of imperfect materials
  and their relaxation behavior, providing insights into dielectric relaxation spectroscopy
  and the structure of imperfect materials.
