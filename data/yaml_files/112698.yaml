tldr: This article examines the connection between oppositely directed air currents
  and the weather experienced in the British Islands. The author, Robert H. Scott,
  investigates the relationship between the polar and equatorial currents and their
  impact on the atmosphere. He found that these currents often lead to significant
  weather changes, such as barometrical depressions and southerly storms. Although
  the exact formation of storms was not observed, the study provides valuable insights
  into the deep-seated disturbances of the atmosphere and the potential for future
  research.
