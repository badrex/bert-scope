tldr: The author discusses the advancements made in zenith telescope observations
  and accuracy at the Royal Observatory. He explains the process he employed to determine
  the place of stars using three different methods, including the zenith telescope,
  mural circles, and a subsidiary star. The author found that the new zenith telescope
  achieved a degree of accuracy never seen before, reducing the error to a quarter
  of a second. This paper highlights the state of practical astronomy at the Greenwich
  Observatory and demonstrates the competition among observers using different instruments.
