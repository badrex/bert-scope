tldr: The author studied the reproductive cycle of the three-spined stickleback fish,
  focusing on the changes in their reproductive organs throughout the year. They examined
  the effects of physical and biological changes in the environment on the reproductive
  cycle and the migration of the fish during the breeding season. The study provides
  insights into the development of gametes and the life cycle of fish living in temperate
  climates.
