tldr: The authors measured chemical shifts in nuclear resonances of caesium ions in
  various solvents and found that the shifts are nonlinear with concentration. They
  used a radial distribution function to calculate the shifts and found that the direct
  interionic interactions are responsible for the nonlinearity. The study provides
  a better understanding of the mechanism behind the chemical shifts and the cause
  of the nonlinear concentration dependence.
