tldr: The article discusses the self-organization of polymer-motor systems in the
  cytoskeleton, focusing on the role of energy transduction in the assembly of microtubule
  and actin filament arrays. It explores the dynamics of polymerization and the activity
  of motor proteins, which play a crucial role in the spatial organization of the
  cytoplasm. The author highlights the importance of understanding these processes
  for the assembly of complex structures like asters, spindles, and leading edge structures.
