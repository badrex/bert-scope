tldr: The author discusses the possibility of observing a faint solar luminous appendage
  beyond the corona during a lunar-solar eclipse. They compare the spectrum of the
  residual twilight to the solar and corona spectra, finding a difference in the wavelength
  of maximum light. This suggests that the residual twilight spectrum is more similar
  to the corona spectrum, which could indicate the presence of a solar appendage.
