tldr: The authors discovered that short hair cells in the chick's cochlea have a transient
  potassium current (I_A) that is not present in tall hair cells. This current is
  sensitive to 4-aminopyridine and plays a role in the high-frequency response of
  the hair cell by decreasing membrane resistance. The findings could be important
  for understanding the function of short hair cells, which are similar to mammalian
  outer hair cells.
