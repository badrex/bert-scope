tldr: The authors studied the reaction between haem a compounds and proteins in alkaline
  solutions, forming Schiff's bases. They discovered that the formyl group in haem
  a compounds is replaced by a group of less electronegative character, leading to
  a shift in absorption bands. This reaction is significant for understanding the
  structure and function of cytochromes in group a.
