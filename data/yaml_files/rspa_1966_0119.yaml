tldr: The authors conducted a crystallography study of a unique arene-rhodium complex,
  -hexakis(trifluoromethyl)benzene rhodium. They discovered a novel form of bonding
  for the benzene ligand and the -cyclopentadienyl anion to the rhodium, which is
  asymmetric and related to similar molecules. The study provides insights into the
  electronic structure and bonding of the complex, contributing to the understanding
  of arene-transition metal complexes.
