tldr: This article reviews the development of electrocatalysts for various types of
  fuel cells, discussing their composition, performance, and potential improvements.
  The six types of fuel cells, including alkaline fuel cells, proton exchange membrane
  fuel cells, and solid oxide fuel cells, are described in the context of their electrocatalyst
  requirements. The authors analyze the limitations of current electrocatalysts and
  propose opportunities for enhancing their performance. The article concludes with
  details of precious metal-based electrocatalyst development for proton exchange,
  solid polymer fuel cells.
