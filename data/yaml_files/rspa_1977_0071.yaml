tldr: This study investigates the far infrared emission spectra of several alkali
  halides, both in solid crystal form and as melts, to understand the motions of ions
  and collective atomic motions in these materials. The authors outline their experimental
  setup and techniques, including Fourier transform spectroscopy, and discuss the
  implications of their findings for understanding the properties of diatomic ionic
  solids at elevated temperatures.
