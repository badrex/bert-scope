tldr: This article investigates the reactions of platinum and tungsten with iodine
  vapour at low pressures. The authors found that tungsten is more readily attacked
  by oxygen than platinum and that the adsorption of iodine on platinum is stronger
  than on tungsten. The study also explores the different modes of heterogeneous actions
  and their rates of reaction.
