tldr: The article investigates the ultrastructural development of silicified tissues
  in the lemma of Phalaris canariensis L. using transmission electron microscopy and
  X-ray microanalysis. The study focuses on silica deposition in the abaxial epidermis
  and macrohairs of the lemma at different stages of maturation. The findings contribute
  to understanding the mechanisms of silica deposition in grasses and their potential
  applications in phytoremediation and food safety.
