tldr: The authors determined the complete amino acid sequence of yeast phosphoglycerate
  mutase, a glycolytic enzyme that converts 3- and 2-phosphoglycerates. The sequence
  allowed for a detailed interpretation of the enzyme's high-resolution X-ray crystallographic
  structure. The study found that phosphoglycerate mutase from different species have
  a high degree of structural homology, indicating a shared evolutionary relationship.
  The enzyme's structure and function are of interest for understanding its role in
  glycolysis and its relationship to other enzymes.
