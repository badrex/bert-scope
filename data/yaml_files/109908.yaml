tldr: In this paper, Sir Humphry Davy discusses various experiments on phosphorus
  combinations and the composition of acids. He refines his previous research on phosphoric
  acid and compares it to the findings of other chemists like Berzelius and Dulong.
  Davy also examines the composition of perchloride of phosphorus, phosphorous acid,
  and hypophosphorous acid, and shares his thoughts on their chemical properties and
  potential compounds.
