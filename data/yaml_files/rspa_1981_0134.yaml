tldr: 'The authors analyzed the 4p-subshell spectrum of Sr I in the vacuum ultraviolet
  range using two methods: comparing with multiconfiguration Hartree-Fock calculations
  and using simplified Lu-Fano plots to order lines into Rydberg series. They identified
  193 Sr I levels and 18 Sr II levels, providing a detailed analysis of the spectrum.'
