tldr: The authors apply functional analysis to oscillatory ship model testing, demonstrating
  that linear theory can be accurate when considering'memory effects.' They show that
  the usual assumption of slow motion derivatives is not entirely accurate and that
  functional analysis can provide a more precise representation of fluid forces and
  moments acting on a ship.
