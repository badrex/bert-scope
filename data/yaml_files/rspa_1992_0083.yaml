tldr: The author investigates the acoustic ring source, a circular ring of sources
  that represents the noise generated by a fixed radial station of a rotating propeller.
  They use asymptotic analysis to derive the field due to a ring source for subsonic
  and supersonic rotation, and apply this method to calculate the near field of the
  propeller in the quiet zone.
