tldr: The authors investigate linear regularization algorithms that provide positive
  approximate solutions for linear inverse problems, such as Fredholm equations of
  the first kind, Cauchy problems for elliptic equations, and backward solutions of
  forward parabolic equations. They focus on ill-posed first-kind convolution equations
  and related problems like numerical differentiation, Radon transform, and Laplace-transform
  inversion. The study discusses several window functions that ensure positive solutions
  while sacrificing resolution.
