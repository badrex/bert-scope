tldr: The authors dated two fragments of Luna 16 mare basalt and two Luna 20 samples
  using the argon dating technique. The results confirm that mare lavas were extruded
  in Mare Fecunditatis 3.4-3.5 Ga ago. The age of the Luna 20 metaclastic fragment
  provides further support for a 3.9 Ga age for the Crisium basin and the widespread
  cataclysmic bombardment of the moon between 4.05 and 3.85 Ga.
