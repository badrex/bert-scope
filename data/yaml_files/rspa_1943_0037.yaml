tldr: The authors studied the infra-red spectra of polymers and related monomers,
  focusing on the vibration frequencies and molecular structures. They analyzed the
  spectra of vinyl halides, chloroprene, and chlorinated paraffins, providing valuable
  information about normal vibration frequencies. The study helps in understanding
  the correlation between vibrational spectra and molecular structure, contributing
  to the field of polymer chemistry.
