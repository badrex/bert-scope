tldr: 'The author discusses enzyme action and the oxidation of xanthin and hypoxanthin.
  They propose that the enzyme is a selective catalyst and classify enzymes into two
  categories: homo-lytic and hetero-lytic. The study reveals that the enzyme can influence
  or direct attack at two centers simultaneously in hypoxanthin, while affecting only
  one in xanthin.'
