tldr: This article presents a refinement analysis of the crystallography of the phospholipid
  1,2-dilauroyl-DL-phosphatidylethanolamine and discusses its implications for lipid-lipid
  and lipid-protein interactions. The study provides a quantitative account of the
  crystal structure and molecular packing, which is essential for understanding the
  behavior of phospholipids in biological membranes.
