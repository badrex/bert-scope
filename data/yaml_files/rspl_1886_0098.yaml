tldr: The author studied the structure and life history of the fungal pathogen Entyloma
  Ranunculi, which causes a disease in the plant Ranunculus Ficaria. They observed
  the disease's progression, the role of conidia in its spread, and the germination
  process of these spores. The study also revealed the connection between conidia
  and resting-spores, and how the disease spreads through stomata.
