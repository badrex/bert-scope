tldr: The authors investigated the quadratic Stark effect in the hyperfine structure
  of the 2P* ground level of aluminum using atomic beams and magnetic resonance. They
  found a small energy shift caused by the application of an electric field and determined
  the tensor polarizability for the hyperfine structure. The theoretical value, including
  hyperfine structure effects, agreed with the experimental results, confirming the
  special nature of the quadratic Stark effect in this case.
