tldr: This article discusses recent developments and future prospects of nuclear magnetic
  resonance (NMR) chemical microscopy, focusing on its applications in medical imaging
  and spectroscopy. The authors explore high spatial resolution imaging, chemical
  shift resolution, and nuclear spin relaxation times to obtain chemical data without
  sacrificing spatial resolution. They also discuss potential applications, limitations,
  and future prospects of NMR chemical microscopy in the field of medicine and biology.
