tldr: The author describes improvements and applications of the steam calorimeter,
  a device used to measure the heat capacity of substances. They discuss the theory
  behind the method, the required apparatus, and the corrections needed for accurate
  measurements. The author also presents experimental results on the density of steam
  and discusses the consistency and accuracy of the method compared to other techniques.
