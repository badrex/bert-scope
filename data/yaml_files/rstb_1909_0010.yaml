tldr: The author conducted a comprehensive study of the intracranial vascular system
  of Sphenodon, using dissection and serial sections. They discovered the arrangement
  and functions of various arteries and veins, including the saccular, pineal, and
  choroidal arteries, and the role of these blood vessels in supplying the brain and
  pineal gland. The study also included the investigation of blood vessels in advanced
  embryonic stages, providing insights into the development of the vascular system
  in Sphenodon.
