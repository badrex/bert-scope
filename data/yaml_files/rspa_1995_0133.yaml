tldr: The authors reevaluate the shock-shock relations for the case of a non-quiescent
  gas ahead of a shock and compare them with experiments. They find that their developed
  model provides better predictions than Han & Yin's (1993) model, which contains
  an error. The study includes comparisons with experimental and numerical results
  for two cases of shock-wave interaction, demonstrating the improved accuracy of
  the new model.
