tldr: In August 1741, a meteor was sighted near Holkam in Norfolk, causing destruction
  and leaving a lasting impression on witnesses. The event was reported to the Royal
  Society by Thomas Lord Lovell, who documented the meteor's path, its effects on
  the environment, and the reactions of those who experienced it firsthand. This account
  provides a detailed description of the meteor's appearance and the damage it caused,
  as well as the remarkable fact that the weather was clear and fine everywhere else
  but in the immediate area of the meteor's path.
