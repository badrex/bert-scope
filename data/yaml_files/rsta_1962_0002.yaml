tldr: This article discusses the stored energy in graphite used in power-producing
  reactors. The authors describe their experimental and theoretical work on the release
  of energy from the graphite moderator at various temperatures. They also explore
  the effects of irradiation and annealing conditions on the energy release and graphite
  conductivity. The findings can help improve reactor design and operation by understanding
  the energy storage and release mechanisms in graphite moderators.
