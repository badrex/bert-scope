tldr: This study investigates the responses of semicircular canal afferents to angular
  and linear acceleration in isolated surviving labyrinths of elasmobranch fishes.
  The researchers found that the time constants and phase aspects of the responses
  to both types of acceleration stimuli are consistently comparable, suggesting similarities
  in the basic mechanism of both types of canal response. The existence of peripheral
  adaptation and associated time constants were taken into account in the analysis.
  The results indicate that the sensitivity of semicircular canals to linear acceleration,
  known as the "Ledoux effect," may not be part of the normal function in controlling
  posture and movement, but it cannot be discounted in the qualitative and quantitative
  analysis of vestibular responses and in differential diagnosis in clinical otology.
