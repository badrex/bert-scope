tldr: The article discusses the role of DNA methylation and genomic imprinting in
  regulating gene expression during development. It highlights the differences in
  the roles of maternal and paternal chromosomes and how they influence cell proliferation
  and differentiation. The study suggests that maternal chromosomes are more important
  when embryonic cells are totipotential or pluripotential, while paternal chromosomes
  are needed for the proliferation of progenitor cells of differentiated tissues.
