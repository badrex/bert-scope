  Sulphathiazole Resistance'

tldr: This study investigates the evolution of drug resistance in bacteria, specifically
  focusing on the relationship between folic acid derivatives and sulphathiazole resistance
  in Escherichia coli. The authors found that bacteria with resistance to sulphathiazole
  have an enhanced ability to synthesize folic acid and accumulate intracellular pteridine.
  This resistance can be inherited and is associated with altered enzymatic activities
  and alternative metabolic pathways.
