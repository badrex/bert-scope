tldr: The article discusses the role of neurotrophins, particularly BDNF, in the development,
  maintenance, and injury of sensory neurons. It explores the possibility of BDNF
  acting as an autocrine and paracrine factor, providing support for neuronal survival.
  The study demonstrates that BDNF plays a crucial role in the survival of sensory
  neurons in both developing and adult stages.
