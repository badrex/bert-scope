tldr: The authors conducted geophysical studies on the Seychelles Bank, analyzing
  seismic refraction and gravity profiles. They discovered that the crust beneath
  the central part of the bank has a continental character and thickness, suggesting
  that the entire Seychelles Bank may represent a small continental fragment. The
  findings challenge previous theories about the origin of the bank and provide insights
  into its geological history.
