tldr: The authors conducted experiments on cobalt structures and discovered that the
  structure of cobalt is anomalous, often a mixture of face-centered-cubic and close-packed-hexagonal
  forms. They found that the broadening of X-ray powder photographs of cobalt is due
  to plate-like imperfections in the structure. The authors proposed a model where
  occasional faults occur in the close-packed structures, resulting in regions of
  perfect crystallization with plate-like character.
