tldr: The study examines the cranial anatomy and functional morphology of Pliosaurus
  brachyspondylus, a large plesiosaur from the Upper Jurassic of Westbury, Wiltshire.
  The skull is long and low with a wide gape, narrow snout, and high temporal region.
  The dentition is robust and caniniform anteriorly, while the posterior teeth are
  hook-shaped to help move large prey items back into the gullet. The jaw musculature
  is specialized for biting and holding onto prey. The cranial skeleton is adapted
  to resist bending stresses, but there is no evidence for any adaptation to torsional
  resistance. Pliosaurus was likely an opportunistic feeder on a wide variety of prey,
  primarily relying on its large eyes for hunting.
