tldr: This study investigates the pressure-temperature equilibria between benzene
  and ferric oxide gel or silica gel in sealed systems. The authors developed a method
  to accurately measure the equilibrium pressures and temperatures, providing valuable
  data for understanding gas-solid equilibria. The research contributes to the understanding
  of adsorption processes and the properties of the materials used.
