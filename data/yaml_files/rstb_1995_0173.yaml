tldr: This study compares the sperm production characteristics of two male reproductive
  strategies in Atlantic salmon, precocious parr and anadromous males. Theoretical
  models predict that males with a higher risk of sperm competition, like parr, should
  invest more in spermatogenesis to achieve fertilization success. The research finds
  that parr invest relatively more heavily in total spermatogenesis, producing greater
  numbers of sperm and having a larger gonosomatic index than anadromous males. These
  findings may explain how male parr, under elevated risks of sperm competition, achieve
  disproportionately high fertilization success.
