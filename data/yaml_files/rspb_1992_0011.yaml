tldr: This study examines the impact of moderate to high worm burdens of Trichuris
  trichiura infection on the cognitive functions of school children in Jamaica. The
  research found that removing worms led to significant improvements in tests of auditory
  short-term memory, scanning, and retrieval of long-term memory. The results suggest
  that whipworm infection has a reversible adverse effect on certain cognitive functions.
  Parasitic helminths, such as Aslumbricoides and Trichuris trichiura, infect a quarter
  of the world's population, with school-age children experiencing the highest prevalence
  and intensity of infections, leading to undernutrition and iron-deficiency anemia,
  which can impair cognitive function and learning ability.
