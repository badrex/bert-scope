tldr: This article describes a method to measure the amount of retinal fatigue caused
  by different colors, showing that it produces color-blindness similar to when one
  of the three color sensations is deficient. The author also demonstrates that the
  trichromatic theory of color vision can be used to calculate the factor of fatigue,
  which is the ratio of the unfatigued sensation to the fatigued one. This discovery
  helps to understand how color perception is affected by retinal fatigue and could
  lead to improvements in color vision testing and color correction technologies.
