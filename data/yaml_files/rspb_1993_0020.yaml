tldr: The authors discuss the issue of taxonomic hypothesis testing and its implications
  for the biodiversity crisis. They highlight the problem of synonymy in species descriptions,
  which has been overlooked in assessments of the levels of taxonomic effort required
  to describe a substantial proportion of the world's species. The authors use the
  insect order Thysanoptera as a test case, demonstrating that a significant proportion
  of species descriptions have been later falsified, leading to a substantial underestimation
  of the amount of work necessary to establish a foundation of descriptions. They
  suggest that a greater emphasis on collaborative exploration of particular geographical
  areas of high species richness and the development of databases and information
  systems could help address the issue.
