tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of the nickel-aluminium system, studying
  the lattice spacings and phase transitions in various alloys. They discovered that
  the lattice spacings of the a- and a'-phases are affected by heat treatment, and
  the solubility of nickel in Ni3Al is very small and varies little with temperature.
  The findings provide insights into the properties and behavior of nickel-aluminium
  alloys.
