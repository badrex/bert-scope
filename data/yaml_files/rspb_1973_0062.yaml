tldr: This study investigates the use of a computer-aided system to assist in surgical
  diagnosis, specifically in patients with abdominal pain. The system uses a variant
  of Bayes Theorem to compare new cases with a database of 600 patients and produce
  a diagnostic prediction. The overall diagnostic accuracy of the computer-aided system
  was 91.5%, significantly higher than the clinicians' accuracy, and the system performed
  well in differentiating between common conditions like appendicitis and non-specific
  abdominal pain. The results suggest that computer-aided systems can be a valuable
  tool in improving diagnostic accuracy in surgical cases.
