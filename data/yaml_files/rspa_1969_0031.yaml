tldr: The authors conducted X-ray crystallography studies on potassium ferricyanide
  to determine its crystal structure at 300 and 95 Kelvin. They found that the coordination
  octahedra are slightly distorted, with a small tetragonal elongation along Fe-CN
  bonds. The crystal paramagnetic susceptibilities are characterized by a unique,
  lower moment parallel to the c-axis. The crystal anisotropy is dominated by the
  coulombic field set up by adjacent potassium ions in the lattice. A simple crystal-field
  approach using symmetry-adapted, zero-order wavefunctions on the iron atoms predicts
  the correct direction and relative magnitudes of the crystal magnetic anisotropies.
