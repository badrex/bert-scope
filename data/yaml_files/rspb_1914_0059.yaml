tldr: The authors studied the morphology and susceptibility of animals to the Liwonde
  strain of trypanosome, a parasite causing disease in humans in Nyasaland. They found
  that the strain was similar to other strains causing disease in humans, wild game,
  and wild Glossina morsitans. The infection in various animals, including dogs, monkeys,
  and rats, showed symptoms and pathological changes similar to those caused by other
  strains. The study suggests that wild Glossina morsitans in a district 100 miles
  south of the "Proclaimed Area" are infected with the trypanosome causing human trypanosome
  disease in Nyasaland.
