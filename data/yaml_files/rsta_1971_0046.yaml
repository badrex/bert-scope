tldr: This article discusses a series of preliminary wind tunnel tests conducted on
  a model of the proposed Liverpool Civic and Social Centre. The tests aimed to investigate
  the wind patterns around the building and their impact on pedestrians. The findings
  provide a guide for further detailed testing as the design progresses, focusing
  on aspects such as gusts, turbulence, and smoke plume direction.
