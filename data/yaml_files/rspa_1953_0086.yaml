tldr: The author conducted experiments to study standing waves and their instability.
  They found that when the height of the crests of standing waves reaches about the
  wavelength, they become pointed in the form of a ridge. The experiments confirmed
  Penney and Price's predictions about the instability of two-dimensional waves and
  revealed the development of three-dimensional instability. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of fluid dynamics and wave mechanics.
