tldr: The authors present a theory for measuring temperature, pressure, density, and
  wind velocity in the upper atmosphere using the rocket-grenade method. They discuss
  the assumptions and calculations involved in this method, which is based on geometrical
  acoustics and can provide accurate results for heights up to 30 km. This method
  has been successfully used in the British upper atmosphere rocket program at Woomera.
