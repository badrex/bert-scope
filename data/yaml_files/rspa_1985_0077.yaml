tldr: The authors present a new approach to crystal engineering of organic compounds,
  focusing on a photoreactive system. They analyze non-bonded forces in crystalline
  organic compounds and apply their methods to the compound 2-benzyl-5-benzylidene-cyclopentanone
  (BBCP) and its derivatives. The study helps predict the structures of related compounds
  and understand the influence of substituents on solid-state reactivities and molecular
  packing. This approach can be used to engineer solids with desired reactivity.
