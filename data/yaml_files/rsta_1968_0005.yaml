tldr: This study analyzes sea level gauge records from six ports in North and East
  Britain to understand the response of sea level to gravitational and radiational
  tide potentials, as well as weather-related factors. The research finds that tidal
  interaction effects due to shallow water are significant and that radiational components
  have consistent amplitudes and phase leads compared to gravitational tides. The
  analysis provides a more accurate prediction of tides and surges than traditional
  harmonic analysis methods.
