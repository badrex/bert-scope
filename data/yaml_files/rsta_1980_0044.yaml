tldr: 'This article discusses the application of statistical techniques in Doppler
  satellite positioning for geodetic purposes. It addresses two main problems: detecting
  outliers in observations and testing coordinates in satellite networks. The authors
  develop confidence regions for both "out of context" and "within context" varieties
  and demonstrate that the latter confidence regions are generally larger than the
  former. They also explore the implications of these developments for Doppler satellite
  positioning.'
