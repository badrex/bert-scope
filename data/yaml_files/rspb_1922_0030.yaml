tldr: The authors conducted detailed observations and experiments on the cell-wall
  structure of cotton hairs. They discovered that the primary wall has a spiral structure
  with possible reversals, and the secondary wall has distinct growth rings. The authors
  also found that the cotton hair cell-wall is an elaborate structure with unique
  features, such as slow spirals and radial boundary surfaces, which may be related
  to the plant's growth and development.
