tldr: The author examines the distribution of nerves in the muscular fibers of frogs,
  specifically the pectoral muscle. They observe that the dark-bordered fibers, which
  are part of the neuromuscular system, branch out and subdivide, providing a network
  of nerves to the elementary muscle fibers. This challenges the common belief that
  nerves only end in free ends or terminate at specific points in the muscle fibers.
