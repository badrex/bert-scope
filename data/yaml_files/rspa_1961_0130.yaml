tldr: The authors conducted density measurements on molten mixtures of potassium nitrate
  and barium nitrate to study their volume changes and mixing behavior. They found
  that the excess volume of mixing for these melts is zero, and the partial equivalent
  volumes of both components are independent of composition at a given temperature.
  This unusual mixing behavior is discussed in relation to possible structures for
  nitrate melts and other ionic liquids.
