tldr: The author discovered that the veins of a bat's wing have rhythmic contractility
  and are equipped with valves. These contractions accelerate the flow of blood in
  the veins, while the valves prevent the backward movement of blood. The study of
  these unique features in bat veins could provide insights into understanding blood
  circulation and potential applications in medicine.
