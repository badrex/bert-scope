revised_title: The Effect of Substituents on the Growth-Regulating Activity of Alkyl
  Carboxylic Acids

tldr: The authors studied the growth-regulating activity of various alkyl carboxylic
  acids, specifically homologous series of w-substituted phenoxy and 1-naphthyl-alkyl
  carboxylic acids. They found that the activity alternated as each series was ascended,
  and that /?-oxidation of the side-chain might occur within plant tissue. The results
  suggest that the presence of certain substituents can hinder /?-oxidation and affect
  the growth-regulating properties of these compounds.
