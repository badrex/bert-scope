tldr: The authors conducted extensive experiments on the mammalian heart to study
  its physiology and pathology. They used various recording methods and instruments
  to measure intracardiac pressure, heart wall contractions, and other factors affecting
  the heart's function. Their findings provide insights into the heart's adaptation
  to different conditions and its role in the overall functioning of the body. This
  research contributes to a better understanding of the heart's mechanics, pharmacology,
  and pathology.
