tldr: The authors used nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to study red blood cells and
  their internal processes. They observed the concentrations of various metabolites,
  such as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, ATP, and inorganic phosphate, and monitored the
  transport of small molecules into cells. NMR allowed them to examine the behavior
  of molecules inside intact cells, providing valuable insights into cellular processes
  and interactions.
