tldr: The authors determined the crystal and molecular structure of fluorene, finding
  it to be a planar molecule. They used trial-and-error methods, least-squares refinement,
  and two-dimensional Fourier syntheses to obtain accurate atomic coordinates. The
  results confirmed the planarity of the molecule, which is important for understanding
  its relation to carcinogenic compounds based on 1:2-benzanthracene.
