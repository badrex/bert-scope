tldr: The author investigates the behavior of the spectrum of a differential equation
  when the spectrum of the unperturbed equation is discrete and the perturbed spectrum
  is continuous. They explore a special case where the boundary condition at infinity
  is satisfied, and analyze the effect of the perturbation on the spectrum and the
  eigenvalues. The results provide insights into the representation of an arbitrary
  function in terms of the solutions of the perturbed equation.
