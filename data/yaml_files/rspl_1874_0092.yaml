tldr: This study examines the relationship between a person's height and the weight
  of their brain, specifically focusing on the cerebrum and cerebellum. The author
  finds that taller individuals have a smaller proportion of brain mass compared to
  their height, while shorter individuals have a larger proportion. The study also
  shows that the influence of sex on brain weight is more significant than the influence
  of stature. This research highlights the importance of considering stature when
  studying brain weight and its variations.
