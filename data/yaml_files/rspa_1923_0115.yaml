tldr: The authors conducted experiments with a carbon arc to study its spectrum in
  the extreme ultra-violet range. They discovered that the arc spectrum can produce
  X-rays of the L type when the applied voltage is around 35 volts, which is in agreement
  with the quantum relation. The experiments also showed that a good mechanical oil
  pump vacuum is sufficient to allow the passage of these radiations through a distance
  of at least 2 meters.
