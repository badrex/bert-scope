tldr: The study investigates the green hydra symbiosis and ammonium assimilation by
  freshly isolated symbionts and cultured algae. It shows that symbionts assimilate
  ammonium at pH 7 but release it at pH 4, where maltose release is maximal. The findings
  suggest that the ammonium compensation point plays a crucial role in maintaining
  high rates of maltose release and controlling symbiont cell division and changes
  in algal number per digestive cell with changes in environmental conditions.
