tldr: This article discusses recent investigations on the mechanical equivalent of
  heat and the calibration of thermometers. The author compares the results of various
  experiments and finds that the uncertainties in the capacity for heat of water have
  been greatly diminished. The findings support the use of Rowland's corrected values
  and contribute to a better understanding of heat and its properties.
