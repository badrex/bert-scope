tldr: The study investigates the projection of the anterior lateral-line nerve to
  the lateral-line lobes of the dogfish brain. The researchers found that electrical
  stimulation of the anterior lateral-line nerves generated field potentials and unit
  discharges in the ipsilateral lateral-line lobes. The lateral-line lobes are the
  projection sites of the lateral-line nerves, and the anterior lobe receives its
  afferent projection from the lateral-line receptors of the head and the electrosensory
  ampullae of Lorenzini. The study provides insights into the neural responses and
  connections in the lateral-line system of the dogfish brain.
