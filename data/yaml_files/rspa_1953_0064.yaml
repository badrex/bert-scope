tldr: The author develops a mathematical theory for estimating precision in spherical
  measurements, considering the topological framework of the surface of a sphere.
  This theory is useful for understanding vectors with large natural dispersions,
  such as remanent magnetism in rocks. The author also discusses the distribution
  of the sum of random unit vectors and its implications for estimating the direction
  and length of the resultant vector.
