tldr: The authors discovered that beech mycorrhizas can absorb sugars from glucose,
  fructose, and sucrose solutions. The rate of hexose absorption depends on the external
  concentration and pH of the solution. During sugar absorption, a respiratory stimulation
  occurs, similar to the respiratory rise observed during the absorption of nutrient
  salts. The authors suggest that the consumption of high-energy phosphate may be
  involved in both processes.
