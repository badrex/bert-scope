tldr: The author analyzes anemograms taken at Armagh Observatory from 1857 to 1863,
  focusing on temperature variations and their relationship with the sun's position.
  They find that despite the discordance of some observations, the overall means show
  a pattern and provide a more accurate representation of the temperature distribution.
