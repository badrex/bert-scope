tldr: The authors reevaluate the dissociation energies of CO, N2, NO, and CN by applying
  the non-crossing rule and analyzing the vibrational energy levels. They propose
  new values for the dissociation energies and discuss the implications for thermochemistry
  and the understanding of molecular states.
