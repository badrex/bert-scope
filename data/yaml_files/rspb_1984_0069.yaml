tldr: 'The author used a double-staining immunohistochemical technique to investigate
  the distribution of catecholamine synthesizing enzymes in the rat superior cervical
  ganglion. They discovered two types of dopaminergic cells: small to medium-sized
  ganglion neurons and small cells resembling small intensely fluorescent (s.i.f.)
  cells. These findings provide evidence that a small proportion of catecholaminergic
  sympathetic neurons use dopamine as their neurotransmitter.'
