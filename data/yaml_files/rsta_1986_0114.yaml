tldr: Scanning electron acoustic microscopy (SEAM) is a new imaging technique that
  provides thermal and elastic information on a micrometer scale. It generates sound
  waves in the sample using a focused electron beam, and the signal from a transducer
  attached to the specimen forms a scanned image. SEAM has various applications, including
  imaging cracks, voids, grains, and magnetic domain structures in materials like
  metals, semiconductors, and polymers. The technique also offers potential for examining
  bonding integrity and evaluating semiconductor materials.
