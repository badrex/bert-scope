tldr: This study investigates the development of mesoderm in the gastropod Viviparus,
  specifically focusing on the formation of the coelom. The research confirms Erlanger's
  earlier work, which described the coelom as a pocket from the archenteron, and provides
  a detailed analysis of the process through which the mesoderm cells develop and
  differentiate in the embryo.
