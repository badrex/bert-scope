tldr: The article discusses the use of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) to create
  images of intact biological systems, such as fruits, animals, and humans. NMR imaging,
  also known as spin mapping or zeugmatography, uses a non-uniform magnetic field
  to label different parts of the specimen with different NMR frequencies, allowing
  for the generation of internal images. The technique is non-invasive, does not use
  ionizing radiation, and can detect differences in relaxation times between normal
  and tumor tissues.
