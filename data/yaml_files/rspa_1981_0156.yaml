tldr: The article examines the growth kinetics of individual ledges during solid-solid
  phase transformations, focusing on the role of volume diffusion in the parent phase.
  The authors re-examine the problem using different mathematical methods and find
  significant differences in the results compared to previous work. They provide a
  more accurate analysis of the solute concentration on the step and the concentration
  gradient, leading to a better understanding of the growth rates and isotherms in
  this process.
