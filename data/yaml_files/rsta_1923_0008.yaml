tldr: The author investigates the stability of a viscous liquid contained between
  two rotating cylinders. They find that the flow becomes unstable when the speed
  of the fluid exceeds a certain limit, leading to turbulent motion. The study focuses
  on understanding the behavior of disturbances in the fluid and their impact on the
  stability of the flow.
