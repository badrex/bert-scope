tldr: This study analyzes the full DNA sequence of the mitochondrial cytochrome b
  gene in the family Camelidae, providing insights into the molecular evolution, relationships,
  and domestication of camelids. The results support the hypothesis that the alpaca
  is a domesticated form of the vicuna and reveal that hybridization has occurred
  in the ancestry of both domesticated camelids.
