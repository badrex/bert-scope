tldr: The authors investigate the properties of Pade approximants in Rayleigh-Schrodinger
  perturbation theory, focusing on their invariance to changes in scale and origin
  in the zero-order Hamiltonian. They demonstrate that a specific sequence of Pade
  approximants is invariant to these alterations when the exact Hamiltonian is recovered,
  suggesting their appropriateness for representing the energy in ab initio perturbative
  calculations.
