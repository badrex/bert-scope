tldr: 'The President''s address at the Royal Society Anniversary Meeting in 1949 highlights
  the achievements of three distinguished scientists: George Charles de Hevesy, George
  Paget Thomson, and Rudolph Albert Peters. De Hevesy''s work on radioactive isotopes
  as tracers in biological processes and his discovery of the element hafnium are
  discussed. Thomson''s investigation of the wave properties of the electron and his
  contributions to atomic physics are also mentioned. Lastly, Peters'' research on
  the role of vitamin Bx in tissue metabolism and his discovery of the compound B.A.L.
  are celebrated. These scientists'' discoveries have significantly impacted the fields
  of biochemistry, atomic physics, and therapeutics.'
