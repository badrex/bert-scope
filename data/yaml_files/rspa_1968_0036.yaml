tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of the reversible hydration of 1,3-dichloroacetone
  in dioxan and acetonitrile solutions. They found that the reaction is influenced
  by the concentration of water and the presence of catalysts. The results suggest
  that the transition state contains one molecule of ketone and three molecules of
  water in the uncatalyzed reaction, while in the catalyzed reaction, a molecule of
  triethylamine or benzoic acid can replace one or two molecules of water, respectively.
  The study provides evidence for a concerted mechanism in the carbonyl hydration
  reaction.
