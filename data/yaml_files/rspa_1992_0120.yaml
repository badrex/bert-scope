tldr: This study investigates the diffusion of turbulent energy in plane Couette flow
  using a direct numerical simulation. The results disprove the counter-gradient diffusion
  hypothesis and reveal that turbulent energy production is nearly balanced by energy
  dissipation throughout the core region. The findings provide a more plausible explanation
  for the behavior of turbulent energy in this type of flow.
