tldr: The authors studied the distribution and division of the Golgi apparatus in
  germ cells during cell division. They found that the Golgi apparatus, composed of
  dictyosomes, divides and disperses during the early stages of cell division and
  reassembles near the centrosphere in later stages. This process, called dictyokinesis,
  is essential for the proper distribution of the Golgi apparatus in daughter cells.
  The research was conducted on various animal cells, including mammals, and provides
  insights into the role of the Golgi apparatus in cell division.
