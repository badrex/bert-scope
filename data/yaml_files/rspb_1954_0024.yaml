tldr: The authors investigate the effects of carbon tetrachloride on liver cells and
  find that it primarily targets mitochondria, causing a disorganization of enzyme
  systems. They also discover that choline administration can delay the onset of liver
  damage. This study provides insights into the mechanism of action of carbon tetrachloride
  and potential ways to mitigate its effects.
