tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in understanding the composition
  and energy spectra of primary cosmic-ray electrons and nuclei above 10 nucleon energies.
  The authors present experimental evidence and its implications, including the behavior
  of individual cosmic-ray species at higher energies and the impact on the origin
  and propagation of cosmic radiation. The findings challenge some assumptions made
  in simple models and provide insights into the properties of cosmic rays and their
  interactions with the interstellar medium.
