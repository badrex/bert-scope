tldr: The author discusses the issue of spurious correlation that can arise when using
  indices in the measurement of biological organs. He explains how this can lead to
  incorrect conclusions about organic relationships and suggests that the amount of
  spurious correlation should be considered when measuring the correlation between
  organs.
