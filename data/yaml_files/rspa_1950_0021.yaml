tldr: The authors studied the benzoyl peroxide photosensitized copolymerization of
  styrene and methyl methacrylate to determine the rate coefficients and understand
  the kinetics of copolymerization. They found that the introduction of small quantities
  of styrene lowered the rate of initiation, and they calculated the absolute velocity
  coefficients for all the steps in the reaction. This research provided valuable
  information about the reactivity of radicals and the mechanism of copolymerization.
