tldr: The author describes a previously unknown fossil organism, possibly a new type
  of chordate, found in the Upper Silurian of Lesmahagow, Lanarkshire. The organism,
  named Ainiktozoon loganense, has a capsule with a palisade, segmented rods, and
  spines, and is potentially significant for understanding the evolution of chordates.
