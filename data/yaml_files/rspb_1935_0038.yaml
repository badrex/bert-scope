tldr: The study investigates the relationship between blood sugar levels and systemic
  blood pressure in rats. The researchers found that decerebration, or the removal
  of the brain's higher functions, can cause a decrease in blood sugar levels. They
  also discovered that low blood pressure plays a significant role in this effect,
  especially when the liver has little glycogen to convert into sugar. This research
  highlights the importance of considering blood pressure when studying blood sugar
  levels and their relationship to the brain.
