tldr: This article discusses the second-order theory of conformal solutions in multicomponent
  systems. It presents a new method to calculate the thermodynamic properties of these
  systems using a reference substance and interaction constants. The authors explore
  the excess free enthalpy of mixing at constant temperature and pressure, and evaluate
  the second-order terms in the process. They provide an expression for the second-order
  free enthalpy of mixing and explain how the coefficients can be related to the thermodynamic
  properties of the reference species.
