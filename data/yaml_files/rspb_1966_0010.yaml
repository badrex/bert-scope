tldr: The authors conducted a study on the metabolism and excretion of tritiated vitamin
  D in young rachitic rats. They prepared various tritium-labeled forms of vitamin
  D and found that [1a-3H]cholecalciferol was a suitable form for further metabolic
  studies. The study showed that much of the tritium from the labeled calciferols
  was found in the body water, and breakdown products of calciferol were present in
  the more polar fractions of the extracts of feces, which passed from the bile.
