tldr: The article discusses the challenges of controlling migrant bird pests, particularly
  the red-billed quelea, in Africa. It suggests that current control strategies, such
  as population reduction, may not be effective and proposes alternative strategies
  based on the birds' biology and migration patterns. The authors recommend tailoring
  control efforts to specific damage situations and using a combination of methods,
  including altering crop phenology, destroying breeding colonies, and implementing
  biological research for other bird pest species.
