tldr: The author presents a theory of free stream lines and applies it to hydrodynamical
  problems. They develop transformation theorems to find the potential of multiple
  parallel conductors and the velocity of fluids in various scenarios, such as jets
  and streams. The author also discusses the behavior of hollow vortices in different
  cases.
