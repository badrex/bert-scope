tldr: This study investigates the characteristics of extensive air showers initiated
  by heavy primary particles using computer simulations. The research focuses on the
  break-up of heavy primary particles upon collision with air nuclei and the resulting
  fluctuations in shower development. The authors use a fragmentation model based
  on nuclear emulsion experiments to represent the interaction of heavy nuclei with
  air nuclei. The study aims to identify the nature of the energetic primary particles
  and improve future experiments for this purpose.
