tldr: This article discusses the thermodynamics of elasticity in biological tissues,
  specifically focusing on muscle fibre bundles and their response to ATP. The author
  explores the effects of a factor discovered by Marsh that modifies muscle fibre
  response to ATP, leading to changes in fibre volume and extensibility. The findings
  suggest that this factor may play a role in controlling myosin enzymatic function
  in resting muscle.
