tldr: James Munro Dodd was a prominent comparative endocrinologist who contributed
  significantly to the field of zoology, particularly in the study of the hypothalamo-pituitary
  axis. His research spanned various species, including cyclostomes, elasmobranch
  and teleost fishes, and amphibians. Dodd's work helped establish comparative endocrinology
  as a recognizable discipline within zoology and played a crucial role in attracting
  many young physiologists to the field.
