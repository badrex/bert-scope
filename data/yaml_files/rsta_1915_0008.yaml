tldr: This article investigates the behavior of the nickel arc under different pressures
  and its effect on the arc spectra. The author observes that the intensity of the
  arc increases with pressure, and the nickel arc's tint changes from mauve to white
  as the pressure of the surrounding air increases. The broadening of lines and their
  reversal is also studied, providing insights into the behavior of the nickel arc
  under pressure.
