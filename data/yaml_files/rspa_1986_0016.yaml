tldr: The author demonstrates that the two-dimensional free-fermion model is equivalent
  to a checkerboard Ising model, which is a special case of the general '-invariant'
  Ising model. Expressions for the partition function and local correlations are given
  in terms of those of the regular square lattice Ising model. The self-dual Potts
  model is also discussed, and the application of the methods to the three-dimensional
  Zamolodchikov model is considered.
