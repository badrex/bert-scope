tldr: The authors explore the new theory of gravitation, focusing on the smooth fluid
  approximation and the behavior of equations in the neighborhood of a particle. They
  demonstrate that the Einstein equations can be derived from the new theory using
  a specific conformal transformation, and discuss the differences between the equations
  in the smooth fluid approximation and those near a particle.
