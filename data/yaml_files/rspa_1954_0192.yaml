tldr: The authors present a generalization of the single-determinant theory in molecular
  orbital chemistry, using a wave function as a linear combination of determinants
  constructed from one-electron orbitals. They derive equations determining the best
  forms of these orbitals and the optimum combinations of determinants, showing that
  these wave functions and equations are invariant under arbitrary unitary transformations
  of orbitals. This theory allows for the construction of localized orbitals for conjugated
  systems and provides a more accurate description of molecular structures.
