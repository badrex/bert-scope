tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the regeneration and functional connections
  of vagus nerve fibers with the cells of the superior cervical ganglion. The results
  showed that afferent and efferent fibers of the vagus nerve can grow and form connections
  with the peripheral end of the sympathetic nerve. This suggests that there is no
  essential difference between pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic fibers in the autonomic
  nervous system.
