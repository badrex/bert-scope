tldr: The author presents exact and approximate formulae for significance tests when
  introducing new functions to represent measures. The tests involve evaluating the
  number of observations, the ratio of the estimated coefficient to the standard error,
  and the null hypothesis. The author also discusses the limitations and applications
  of these tests in various scenarios.
