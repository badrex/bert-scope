tldr: The authors made an absolute determination of the ampere using a current weigher,
  a physical balance with two coil systems, and made modifications to improve the
  accuracy of the measurements. They determined the linear dimensions of the coils,
  the moment of inertia of the moving parts, and the thermal coefficients of linear
  expansion to minimize errors in the determination of current. The error in the determination
  of current, arising from want of exact knowledge of the linear dimensions of the
  coils, does not exceed 1 part in 100,000.
