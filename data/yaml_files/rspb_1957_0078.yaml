tldr: The authors discuss the use of diathermy apparatus for rapidly rewarming whole
  animals from 0Â°C and below. They describe an oscillator-based method that uses induced
  currents to heat the animal, and explain the challenges of applying this method
  to larger animals. The authors also acknowledge the help of colleagues in the design
  and construction of the apparatus.
