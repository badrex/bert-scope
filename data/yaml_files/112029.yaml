tldr: This article by Hermann Helmholtz discusses the normal motions of the human
  eye in relation to binocular vision. He explains how the eye can move in various
  directions but cannot rotate around the visual line voluntarily. Helmholtz also
  describes the use of ocular spectra to determine the position of the eyeball and
  the law regulating the position of the eye for every direction of its visual line.
