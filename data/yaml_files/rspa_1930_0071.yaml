revised_title: Investigation of Structure in Permeable Collodion Gel Films and its
  Significance in Filtration
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Materials Science
semantic_tags:
- Filtration
- Collodion gel films
- Nitro-cotton
- Ultra-filtration
- Phase transition
tldr: 'The authors discovered two types of structure in permeable collodion gel films:
  microgel and ultragel. They investigated the conditions that determine these structures
  and found that gelation is a phase transition influenced by desolvation. The study''s
  findings have implications for understanding ultra-filtration and interpreting filtration
  results.'
