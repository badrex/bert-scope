tldr: Mr. Aubry describes a medicated spring in Lancarim, Wales, which is frequented
  for treating the King's Evil. The spring emerges from white marl and is believed
  to have healing properties due to the limestone in the area. The surrounding environment
  includes an old oak tree with hoary moss and a waterfall.
