tldr: This article presents a refined co-ordinate system for analyzing satellite orbits,
  taking into account the oblateness of the Earth and neglecting other perturbing
  forces. The authors improve upon previous methods by allowing the maximum latitude
  of the subsatellite point to vary, providing more accurate predictions of satellite
  motion. The study focuses on near-Earth satellites and offers a deeper understanding
  of their orbital dynamics.
