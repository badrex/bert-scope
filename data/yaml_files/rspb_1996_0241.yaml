tldr: The authors study the two basic mechanisms of insect wing folding, Internal
  (INT) and External (EXT), and analyze their differences in movement, velocity ratios,
  and reversibility. They find that INT mechanisms have a slower initial movement
  and higher velocity ratio at larger angles, while EXT mechanisms have a faster initial
  movement and lower velocity ratio at smaller angles. INT mechanisms can be actively
  unfolded, while EXT mechanisms usually need to be closed elastically or by an extraneous
  force.
