tldr: The author presents a simple and accurate method for estimating the amount of
  ammonia in atmospheric air. The method involves drawing air through two glass tubes
  filled with acidulated water, which absorbs the ammonia. The ammonia is then measured
  using a Nessler solution. The author discusses the results of experiments conducted
  in Burton-on-Trent and the surrounding area, and the influence of wind and rain
  on ammonia levels. The method is found to be more reliable than other methods due
  to its ability to avoid interference from nitrogenous organic matter and its effectiveness
  in filtering out ammonia using cotton-wool.
