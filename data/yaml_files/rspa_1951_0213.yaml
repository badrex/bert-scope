tldr: The authors conducted experiments on thermal neutron diffraction by single crystals
  and demonstrated that accurate comparison of structure factors can be made using
  cylindrical or pillar crystals. They discussed the use of single crystals for neutron
  crystallography, extending the field of structure analysis beyond the limitations
  of powder methods. The study also explored the effects of crystal thickness and
  mosaic spread on diffraction patterns and provided insights into the practical applications
  and limitations of this technique.
