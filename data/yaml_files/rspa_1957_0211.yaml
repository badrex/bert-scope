- Bond dipole and bond length
tldr: The authors studied the intensities of fundamental and overtone vibration bands
  of the OH group in phenols and alcohols. They found that variations in electrical
  anharmonicity can explain differences in the relative intensities of the fundamental
  and overtone for different molecules. The results provide insights into the relation
  between bond dipole and bond length and help decide between alternative solutions
  for the O-H bond in water.
