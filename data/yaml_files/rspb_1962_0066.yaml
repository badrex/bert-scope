tldr: The author discusses heterochronic transplantation, a method used to study the
  effects of aging on tissues and organs. By transplanting tissues from animals of
  different ages into other animals, researchers can analyze the changes that occur
  in various systems as they age. The author presents four experimental situations
  that demonstrate the usefulness of this method, including ovarian grafts, skin grafts,
  and the study of immune responses in aging animals.
