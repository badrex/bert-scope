tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a binocular method and an episcotister
  to measure the intensity variation of the latent period of vision in two observers.
  They found that in the fovea, the latent period decreases with increasing intensity
  near the threshold, reaches a minimum, and then slightly rises again. In the extra-fovea,
  the decrease in latent period is more marked and uniform. The results have implications
  for understanding the Pulfrich effect and other visual phenomena.
