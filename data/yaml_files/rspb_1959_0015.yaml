tldr: The authors used radiocarbon dating to study the Late-glacial Period in Britain.
  They analyzed deposits from several sites and found that the Late-glacial zones
  in Britain, Denmark, north-west Germany, and Holland are synchronous. The study
  helps to resolve the extensive evidence of vegetational history during the Late-glacial
  and Post-glacial Periods.
