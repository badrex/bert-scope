tldr: This article presents a new approach to growth analysis for perennial plants,
  focusing on the apple tree. The authors introduce a new concept of the leaf/plant
  mass ratio, which takes into account the contribution of earlier seasons' growth
  to the perennating system. They also propose the unit production rate as a measure
  of growth relative to the mass of the perennating structure. This new approach allows
  for a better understanding of perennial plant growth and can be used to make more
  pertinent comparisons when interpreting treatment effects.
