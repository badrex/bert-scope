tldr: This study investigates the response of turbulent boundary layers to oscillatory
  flows with constant velocity mean flow and a harmonic oscillatory velocity in the
  form of a traveling wave. The experiments were conducted in a wind tunnel, and the
  results show that the mean flow and turbulent intensity distributions remain relatively
  insensitive to the oscillations. An approximate analysis based on these results
  is developed, providing a guide to the physical processes involved.
