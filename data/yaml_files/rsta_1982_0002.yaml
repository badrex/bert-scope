tldr: This article discusses the theoretical status of quantum chromodynamics (QCD),
  a theory that describes the strong nuclear force between quarks and the fundamental
  particles called hadrons. The author reviews the motivation for QCD, its qualitative
  successes, and potential problems, such as the axial anomaly and the need for regularization
  schemes. The article also explores quantitative investigations of QCD, including
  short-distance physics, long-range properties, and the possibility of quark confinement.
