tldr: The author developed a portable variometer for magnetic surveying, which allows
  for more accurate and efficient measurements of the horizontal component of the
  Earth's magnetic force. This new method replaces the traditional method of taking
  absolute observations at each location with a simpler approach that gives the differences
  between two places, making it more practical for fieldwork.
