tldr: The authors estimate the number of quantal transmitter packets released during
  chemical potentiation of transmitter release in frog nerve endplates. They find
  that the average value of m (number of quantal packets) at normal nerve-muscle junctions
  is about 288, which increases to around 380 when considering temporal dispersion
  of quantal release. After treatment with diaminopyridine or tetraethylammonium,
  transmitter release is greatly enhanced, with values of m exceeding 104 found frequently.
  The authors also discuss the relationship between quantal content and neuromuscular
  facilitation.
