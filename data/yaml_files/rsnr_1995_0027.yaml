tldr: This article explores the connections and influences of the Romantic poet Samuel
  Taylor Coleridge with leading British and German scientists of the Enlightenment
  era. Coleridge, despite not being a scientist himself, cultivated friendships with
  notable figures like Georg Christoph Lichtenberg and Johann Friedrich Blumenbach,
  who were involved in various scientific fields. These relationships helped shape
  Coleridge's understanding of science and influenced his literary works.
