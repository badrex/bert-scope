tldr: This study examines the effect of very small electric currents on the growth
  rate of barley coleoptiles. The researchers found that a one-hour electrification
  had a significant positive effect on growth, with a probability of over 200:1. The
  study also discusses the importance of accurate statistical analysis to improve
  the accuracy of the method and reduce the impact of errors in the experiment.
