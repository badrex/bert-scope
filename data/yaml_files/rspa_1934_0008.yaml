tldr: The authors studied the transformation of N-bromoacetanilide into p-bromoacetanilide
  in non-aqueous solvents, focusing on acid catalysis. They found that the reaction
  showed general acid catalysis and was influenced by the solvent's dielectric constant
  and associating power. The results provide insights into acid catalysis in non-aqueous
  solvents and the role of carboxylic acids in these reactions.
