tldr: This article discusses the dilatational stability of the Earth, focusing on
  the effects of hydrostatic pressure on its interior. The author argues that the
  enormous pressure within the Earth does not cause it to lose its solid state and
  that the usual equations of elasticity can be applied to matter in a state of stress,
  provided that the altered values of the elasticities are considered.
