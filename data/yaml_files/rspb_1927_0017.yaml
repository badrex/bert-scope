tldr: The study investigates the relationship between sperm suspension density and
  fertility in rabbits through artificial insemination. The researchers found that
  a significant decline in fertility occurs below a density of 10^4 spermatozoa per
  cubic centimeter, suggesting that a higher number of spermatozoa is necessary for
  successful fertilization. The findings contribute to understanding factors affecting
  fertility and sterility in normal breeding.
