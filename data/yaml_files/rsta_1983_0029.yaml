tldr: This article discusses the physics, chemistry, and applications of thermotropic
  liquid crystals, focusing on the structural studies of nematic and smectic phases.
  The author reviews information about liquid crystal phases obtained through light
  scattering and high-resolution X-ray scattering. The nematic-smectic transition
  is analyzed, and the de Gennes-McMillan model is found to be correct. The smectic
  A to smectic transition exhibits classic mean-field behavior, and preliminary results
  of a study of a nematic-smectic A transition in a lyotropic material indicate similarities
  to thermotropic materials.
