tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of singly ionised antimony to understand
  its electronic transitions and ionization processes. They used empirical rules to
  classify the observed spectral lines and found that the terms in the 5p and 6s levels
  follow j-j coupling. The study provides insights into the atomic structure and ionization
  potential of antimony.
