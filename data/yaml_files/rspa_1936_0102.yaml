tldr: The author investigates the electrostatic forces between ions and their impact
  on the rates of reactions in solution. They develop a theoretical framework that
  accounts for the abnormal behavior of ionic reactions and explains the variation
  of reaction rates with temperature and ionic strength. This study provides a better
  understanding of solvent action and the role of electrostatic forces in chemical
  reactions.
