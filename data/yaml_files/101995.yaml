tldr: Sir Edm. King observed and documented various types of microscopic animalcula
  in pepper-water using a microscope. He discovered that these creatures resemble
  fish in their behavior, such as flocking together, following their liquid environment,
  and recovering from apparent death. King also demonstrated the creatures' sensitivity
  to various substances, such as spirit of vitriol, salt, and ink, by observing their
  reactions under the microscope.
