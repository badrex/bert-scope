tldr: This study investigates the time course of heat effects in rapid chemical changes,
  focusing on reactions of acids, bases, amino-acids, and proteins. The authors developed
  a method to mix reagents and measure the heat evolved within a fraction of a second,
  allowing them to analyze the rate of neutralization and heat effects in various
  reactions. The findings provide insights into the rapid changes in muscle, nerve,
  and blood, and contribute to understanding the role of separate chemical reactions
  in these processes.
