tldr: John Lennard-Jones was a renowned theoretical physicist and chemist who made
  significant contributions to the understanding of interatomic forces, molecular
  orbitals, and the solid state. He introduced the Lennard-Jones potential, which
  is still widely used today, and played a key role in establishing theoretical chemistry
  as a field of study. Lennard-Jones also made important discoveries in quantum mechanics,
  molecular orbitals, and the behavior of atoms and molecules adsorbed on surfaces.
