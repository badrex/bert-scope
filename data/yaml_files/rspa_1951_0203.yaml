tldr: This article explores the interaction between screw dislocations and sound waves,
  focusing on the scattering of long shear waves by a screw dislocation. The authors
  develop a model to analyze the forces acting on the dislocation and the resulting
  vibrations, which can impact the material's properties and behavior.
