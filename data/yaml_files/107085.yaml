tldr: The author, Thomas Young, examines the mechanism of the eye and its ability
  to accommodate different distances. He explores the functions of the eye, including
  the perception of light and color, and investigates the dimensions and refractive
  powers of the human eye. Young also discusses the capacity of the eyes of various
  animals for different functions and the role of the retina and auditory nerve in
  vision and hearing.
