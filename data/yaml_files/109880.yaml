tldr: Thomas Knight discusses his regret over discovering that his demonstration of
  the Binomial Theorem and the first proposition of his paper on logarithm construction
  had already been given by Mr. Spence. Knight provides a solution to a class of equations
  that Spence had considered but not fully resolved.
