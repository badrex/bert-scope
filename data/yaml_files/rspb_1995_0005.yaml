tldr: The authors propose an alternative evolutionary pathway for uniparental inheritance
  of organelles, considering the autonomous evolution of cytoplasmic genes. They suggest
  that organelles specialize to cell lines and invade the cytoplasm by replicating
  in the female germ-line, leading to a stable mode of inheritance. This process is
  influenced by the selective context acting on the germ line and the dynamics of
  two-level selection.
