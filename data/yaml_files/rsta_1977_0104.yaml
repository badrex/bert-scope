tldr: The authors studied fossil cosmic ray tracks in lunar samples to analyze the
  ancient cosmic ray composition. They found that the etchable radiation damage of
  these tracks was only slightly affected by the annealing process. The ancient cosmic
  ray Cr group to Fe ratio was deduced to be approximately 0.7-0.8, which is enhanced
  by a factor of about two compared to the present-day cosmic ray composition. This
  indicates that either a long-term change in the cosmic ray composition has occurred
  or the interpretation of track data is more complicated than previously assumed.
