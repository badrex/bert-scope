tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effects of additives on marginal detonation
  in gases, specifically hydrogen and oxygen mixtures. They found that additives like
  argon, nitrogen, and iodomethane narrow the limits of detonation, while water vapor
  and furan have complex effects. The results help to understand the thermodynamic
  and kinetic characteristics of reactions that sustain detonation waves and the role
  of additives in inhibiting detonation propagation.
