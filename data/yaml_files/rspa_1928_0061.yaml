tldr: This article presents an analytical solution for the bending of centrally-loaded
  isotropic rectangular plates supported at two opposite edges. The author derives
  the deflection equation using complex variable transformations and Fourier series,
  providing a comprehensive understanding of the plate's behavior under load. This
  work has implications for determining elastic constants in materials and designing
  structures with optimal support.
