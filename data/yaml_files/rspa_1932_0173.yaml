tldr: This article investigates the mechanism of detonation in solid explosives, focusing
  on the initiation and propagation of detonation waves. The authors discuss the limitations
  of classical mechanical theories and propose a new approach to understanding the
  behavior of high explosives. They develop a method to test the sensitivity of explosive
  compositions using fall hammer tests and analyze the results to gain insights into
  the factors contributing to detonation.
