tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the coloration and electrical
  conductivity of flames containing vaporized alkali salts. They found that the coloration
  and conductivity were due to the presence of free ions in the flame, which were
  produced by the dissociation of the salt vapors. This study has implications for
  understanding the behavior of flames and the potential applications in spectroscopy
  and chemical analysis.
