  and Ion Channel Expression in Rat Pheochromocytoma (PC12) Cells

tldr: The study investigates the effects of inhibiting protein kinases in rat pheochromocytoma
  (PC12) cells, comparing the results with those of nerve growth factor (NGF) induced
  differentiation. The research shows that while both methods promote morphological
  differentiation, only NGF enhances ion channel expression. This discovery provides
  insight into the mechanisms of neuronal differentiation and the role of protein
  kinases in ion channel regulation.
