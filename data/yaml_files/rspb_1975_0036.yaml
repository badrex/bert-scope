tldr: The author discusses the control of cell growth regulation by tumour-inducing
  viruses, focusing on the differences between fibroblastic and epithelial cells.
  They explore the effects of medium factors, attachment surface, and the role of
  calcium in cell growth. The study aims to clarify the mechanisms of growth control
  and understand the properties of viral transforming genes.
