tldr: This article investigates the singularities of electron kernel functions in
  an external electromagnetic field. The authors derive the kernel functions from
  solutions of the second-order wave equation using the proper-time parametrization.
  They introduce iterated kernel functions and develop a gauge-independent perturbation
  theory. The separation of singular parts is done in terms of iterated kernel functions
  valid in the absence of an electromagnetic field, and the singular expressions are
  obtained in a more transparent form than those given by Heisenberg.
