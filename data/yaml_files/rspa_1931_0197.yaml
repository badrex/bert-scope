tldr: This article describes a method for measuring the viscosity of gases at high
  pressures, specifically nitrogen up to 1000 atmospheres. The authors developed a
  transpiration method using a glass capillary and mercury to measure the mass of
  gas flowing through the capillary under a pressure gradient. The results provide
  insights into the behavior of gases under high pressure and their viscosity-density
  relationships.
