tldr: The article establishes a connection between the null field method and modified
  Green functions for solving Dirichlet and Neumann problems for the Helmholtz equation
  in an exterior domain. It shows that elements of the -matrix, formed by using appropriately
  chosen expansion functions, are precisely the coefficients of a representation of
  the Green function in terms of these same expansion functions. The linear independence
  of these functions and the invertibility of several infinite-dimensional matrices
  and their finite-dimensional approximations are crucial to the -matrix approach.
