tldr: The author investigates the relationship between sunspots and the influence
  of planets. He proposes that sunspots are generated by the interaction of primary
  and secondary radiation from the sun, and that the distribution of sunspots is influenced
  by the positions of planets. This study contributes to our understanding of solar
  activity and its connection to planetary movements.
