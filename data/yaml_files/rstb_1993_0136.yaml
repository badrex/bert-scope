tldr: The authors explain the role of the CD4 receptor in HIV binding and entry into
  cells. They use soluble CD4 (sCD4) to study the interactions between CD4 and the
  HIV envelope glycoproteins, which lead to membrane fusion. The study reveals that
  sCD4 binding induces the dissociation of the gp120 and gp41 glycoprotein subunits,
  exposing the gp41 fusion peptide and facilitating virus-cell membrane fusion.
