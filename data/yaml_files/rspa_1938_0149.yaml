tldr: 'The authors conducted experiments to investigate the relationship between shower
  frequency and general cosmic-ray intensity. They found that the presence of light
  materials, such as stone, over the lead absorber significantly reduces the number
  of showers and alters the shape of the transition curve. The study concludes that
  the presence of dense light material over the apparatus influences the number of
  showers and the shape of the transition curve in three main ways: density transition,
  atomic number transition, and filtration effect.'
