tldr: The article presents a perturbation theory for Sturm-Liouville problems with
  interior singularities. The authors construct self-adjoint and -sectorial extensions
  for three different problems and establish norm resolvent convergence of approximating
  sequences of operators with smooth potentials. They also discuss various qualitative
  and quantitative properties of their spectra, comparing them with the one-dimensional
  Coulomb problem.
