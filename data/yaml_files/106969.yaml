tldr: In 1798, William Herschel discovered four additional satellites of the planet
  Georgium Sidus (now known as Uranus). He also explained the retrograde motion of
  its older satellites and the disappearance of satellites at certain distances from
  the planet. This discovery expanded our understanding of the planetary system and
  the capabilities of telescopes at the time.
