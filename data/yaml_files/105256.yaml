tldr: In a letter to the Royal Society, George Edwards describes a new species of
  snipe or tringa, which he names the "coot-footed tringa." This bird has webbed feet
  similar to the fulica or bald-coot and is distinguished by its unique scalloped
  and pectinated toes. Edwards provides a detailed description of the bird's physical
  characteristics, including its size, coloration, bill shape, and eye placement.
  He also discusses the bird's habitat and behavior, as well as its probable origins
  and potential for further discovery.
