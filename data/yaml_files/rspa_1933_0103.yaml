tldr: The author examines the electronic properties of conductors and insulators,
  focusing on surface conditions and their role in photoconductivity. They discuss
  the necessary surface charges and how they affect the behavior of electrons and
  holes in crystals, explaining the differences in conductivity between various materials
  like diamond, zinc blende, and yellow rock salt.
