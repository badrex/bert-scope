tldr: This article investigates the development of traveling waves in quadratic and
  cubic autocatalysis with unequal diffusion rates. The authors study the behavior
  of solutions to the initial-value problem and analyze the permanent form traveling
  wave solutions of the equation. They find that the traveling wave solutions exhibit
  a slow exponential decay to their final values and that the behavior of the system
  is influenced by the diffusion rates of the molecules involved.
