revised_title: Application of Calculus of Symbols to Linear Partial Differential Equations
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Calculus of variations
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author applies the calculus of symbols to solve linear partial differential
  equations and functional equations. They demonstrate how certain algebraic quantities
  combine with symbols of partial differentiation, expanding the range of their use.
  The author also provides examples of internal and external division, and applies
  the method to solve functional equations.
