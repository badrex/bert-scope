tldr: The authors study the ecological stability of Lake George in Uganda, focusing
  on the factors that contribute to its relatively stable population densities. They
  examine the fluctuations in phytoplankton and zooplankton biomass, as well as the
  influence of climate, physical, and chemical factors on the community. The study
  highlights the importance of nutrient cycling, mixing regime, and the balance between
  climate and biota in maintaining the lake's ecological stability.
