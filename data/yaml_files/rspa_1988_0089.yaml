tldr: The authors studied the evaporation and combustion of levitated droplet arrays
  on a hot surface, focusing on the interactions between droplets in various geometrical
  configurations. They found that the burning rates and flame shapes of droplets in
  close proximity differ from those of isolated droplets. The results provide insights
  into applications such as combustion of fuel sprays, cooling of electronic devices,
  and fire extinguishment.
