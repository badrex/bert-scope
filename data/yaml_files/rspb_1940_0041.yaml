tldr: The authors conducted X-ray studies on the molecular structure of myosin, a
  protein found in muscle tissue. They discovered that myosin shares similarities
  with keratin, a protein found in hair, in terms of molecular configuration and elastic
  properties. The authors also found that myosin undergoes a process called supercontraction,
  which involves a reversible folding of the protein chain system. This discovery
  helps explain the contractile properties of muscle tissue and the extensibility
  of hair.
