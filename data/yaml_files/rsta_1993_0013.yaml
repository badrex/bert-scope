tldr: This article discusses the melting and movement of the Earth's crust, focusing
  on trace element fractionation processes in the generation of island arc basalts.
  The authors analyze the minor and trace element features of magmas generated above
  subduction zones and evaluate their consistency with major element models. They
  conclude that the degree of melting varies with crustal thickness and that the observed
  range in Ce/Sm ratios can be generated by 3-18% fractional melting of a slightly
  LREE-depleted source.
