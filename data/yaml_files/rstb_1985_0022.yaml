tldr: This article discusses the changes in the central nervous system caused by nociceptive
  input and how human beings can induce trance states to not feel pain. The author
  presents examples of memory traces being reactivated by new painful inputs and how
  these changes can be linked to learning and neural activities. The article also
  explores different ways humans can enter trance states to avoid pain, such as fire-walking
  and focusing on a specific object.
