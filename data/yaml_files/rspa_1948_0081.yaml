tldr: The article presents theoretical considerations for using flat-ended projectiles
  to determine dynamic yield stress. The author, Sir Geoffrey Taylor, discusses the
  mechanics of impact and the behavior of materials under high stress. The study focuses
  on the dynamics of the projectile and the plastic waves that occur during impact,
  providing a simplified model for understanding the phenomenon.
