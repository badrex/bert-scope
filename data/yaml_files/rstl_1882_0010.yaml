tldr: The author investigates the vibrations of a vortex ring and the interaction
  between two vortex rings in a perfect fluid. They find that a circular vortex ring
  is stable for all displacements of its axis and that the time of vibration for a
  displacement depends on the size of the vortex. The author also explores the action
  between two vortex rings that never approach closer than a large multiple of their
  diameter, finding that the velocities of the fluid due to the interaction can be
  calculated using certain formulas.
