tldr: This study examines the effects of lake acidification on aquatic midges in north
  European lakes, focusing on chironomids. The research reveals that acidification
  has led to a decrease in midge diversity, productivity, and survival potential.
  The most significant changes in midge faunas occurred when the pH dropped below
  5.0-5.5, which may be explained by decreased environmental stability, increased
  toxic aluminum concentrations, and changes in microorganisms and algae that serve
  as food for midges. The study supports the idea that oligotrophication is a feature
  of acidified lakes.
