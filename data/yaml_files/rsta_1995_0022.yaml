tldr: The authors present a novel technique to reject outliers from an m-dimensional
  data set when the underlying model is a hyperplane. The method operates in the orthogonal
  regression framework, using a new regression diagnostic based on eigendecomposition.
  It subsumes the traditional residuals scheme and provides an error model for the
  solution once the contaminants have been removed.
