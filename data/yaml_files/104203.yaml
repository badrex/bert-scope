tldr: This article describes a rare case of a woman whose bones gradually became soft
  and flexible due to a medical condition. Despite the use of various medications,
  her bones continued to soften until they were as pliable as a rag. The author, Sylvanus
  Bevan, provides a detailed account of the woman's condition, including the softening
  of her sternum, ribs, and other cartilaginous parts. The woman eventually passed
  away, and an autopsy revealed that her bones had been replaced by a honey-like fluid,
  with only the outer layers remaining. This case study offers valuable insights into
  the nature of bone disorders and the importance of cartilage in maintaining bone
  structure.
