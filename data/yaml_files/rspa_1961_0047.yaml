tldr: This article presents a mathematical theory of capillarity, focusing on the
  physical and mathematical principles that govern the behavior of fluids in small
  spaces. The authors develop a mathematical model to describe the forces acting on
  fluid interfaces and the resulting capillary phenomena. This work provides a deeper
  understanding of the underlying mechanisms of capillary action and has implications
  for various applications, such as microfluidics and materials science.
