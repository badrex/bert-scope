tldr: This article provides a general introduction to the concepts of chaos and forecasting
  in geophysical and astrophysical fluid dynamics. It discusses the presence of irregular
  behavior in these fluid systems and the challenges in predicting their future behavior.
  The article also explores the role of chaos theory in understanding and analyzing
  these complex systems, as well as the potential applications in meteorology and
  other areas of geophysical research.
