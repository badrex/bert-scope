tldr: The article investigates the effects of tetraethylammonium on the release of
  enkephalins from the myenteric plexus of guinea-pig ileum. The results show that
  tetraethylammonium increases the release of enkephalins, making it a useful tool
  for studying the role of enkephalins in the nervous system.
