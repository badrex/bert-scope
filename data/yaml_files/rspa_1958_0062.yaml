tldr: The article discusses the moment problem, which involves determining the set
  of all real sequences that have non-decreasing functions as solutions. The author
  presents a general approach to solving this problem, covering various types of moment
  problems and providing a comprehensive theory that generalizes and simplifies previous
  results. The study focuses on moments of non-negative mass and the conditions under
  which a point can admit mass.
