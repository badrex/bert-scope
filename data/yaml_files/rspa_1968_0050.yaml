tldr: This article reviews recent developments in industrial organic chemistry, focusing
  on new processes for producing bulk organic chemical products. It discusses the
  importance of reactions involving hydrocarbons and oxygen, as well as the use of
  alternative raw materials and fewer reaction stages. The article highlights the
  production of acetic acid through various methods, including the oxidation of paraffin
  hydrocarbons and the reaction of methanol with carbon monoxide. It also covers the
  oxidation of secondary alcohols from n-paraffins and cyclohexane.
