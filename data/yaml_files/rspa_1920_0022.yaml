tldr: This article discusses the lateral vibrations of sharply-pointed bars, focusing
  on the mathematical analysis and equations that govern these vibrations. The author
  explores the effects of the bar's shape, sharpness of ends, and the resulting frequencies
  of vibration. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of solids and
  has applications in engineering and technology.
