tldr: The authors study various types of lightning discharges and their leader processes,
  focusing on abnormal first leader processes and discharges with new channels for
  part of their length. They analyze the behavior of these discharges and find that
  they follow principles similar to the more common types of discharges. The authors
  provide detailed descriptions and measurements of these processes, contributing
  to the understanding of lightning phenomena.
