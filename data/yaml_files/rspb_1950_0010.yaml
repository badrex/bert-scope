tldr: Researchers have examined the molecular structure of the anti-pernicious anaemia
  factor, a substance found in liver, using crystallography. They discovered that
  the crystals contain the same molecular structure but have small variations in unit-cell
  dimensions and crystal habit, which are likely due to differences in solvent content
  and impurities. The crystals are orthorhombic and optically negative, with refractive
  indices that vary depending on the crystal orientation. The researchers determined
  that the molecular weight of the anti-pernicious anaemia factor is between 1360
  and 1575, and they also observed a phenomenon of solvent loss from the crystals
  combined with the development of crystal disorder, which is common among proteins.
