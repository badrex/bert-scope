tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of atmospheric pressure
  on the illuminating power of flames. They found that the illuminating power of a
  flame decreases as the atmospheric pressure decreases. The experiments showed that
  even small changes in pressure can cause a significant reduction in the amount of
  light emitted by gas flames. The results suggest that natural fluctuations in atmospheric
  pressure can affect the luminosity of flames.
