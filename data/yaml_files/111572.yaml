tldr: The author, George Bowdler Buckton, investigates the properties and reactions
  of organo-metallic radicals, specifically mercuric, stannic, and plumbic ethyls.
  He describes the preparation and analysis of these compounds, their reactions with
  acids and other substances, and their potential applications in further research.
  Buckton also discusses the electro-negative character of these organo-metals and
  their interactions with other elements, such as sodium.
