tldr: The discussion focuses on the discovery and properties of heavy hydrogen isotopes,
  including the separation and concentration methods, and their potential impact on
  various fields. The isotopes' higher mass leads to differences in diffusion rates,
  chemical reactions, and physical and chemical processes in living organisms. The
  isotopes also play a significant role in nuclear reactions and transformations,
  leading to the discovery of new particles and the development of new projectiles
  for studying atomic structures.
