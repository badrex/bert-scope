tldr: The authors study the strength properties of highly elastic materials, specifically
  vulcanized rubber, and how cracks grow under repeated stressing. They introduce
  the concept of a fatigue limit, below which the life of the material can be virtually
  indefinite. They also explain how to calculate the energy required to rupture the
  polymer chains across the path of a crack, which is related to the material's molecular
  structure. This research helps to understand the difference between various strength
  properties, such as tensile strength and tear strength, and how they relate to the
  material's viscoelastic behavior.
