tldr: The author discusses quaternary cubics under the canonical form introduced by
  Professor Sylvester. He demonstrates how to form contravariants and invariants with
  a supernumerary variable and applies this principle to form covariants, contravariants,
  and invariants of the cubic. The paper also explores the discriminant and the five
  fundamental invariants of the cubic, as well as the analogies between the theory
  of quaternary cubics and binary quintics.
