tldr: The authors investigate the scattering of fast electrons by atomic nuclei using
  Dirac's wave equation. They find that the scattered intensity depends on the spin
  direction of the incident electrons, indicating that the spin direction has a physical
  meaning. The study also provides a formula for the scattering of an unpolarized
  beam, replacing the Rutherford formula for fast electrons.
