tldr: This article explores the use of prior knowledge in interpreting synthetic aperture
  radar images. The authors demonstrate how incorporating background clutter and target
  characteristics into a model can improve image interpretation and enhance resolution.
  They also discuss the importance of simulating textures with similar statistical
  properties to the original image, which can help estimate target detection probabilities.
