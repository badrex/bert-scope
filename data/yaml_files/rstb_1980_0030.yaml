tldr: This study examines the non-marine Mollusca found in Sugworth, Oxfordshire,
  from middle Pleistocene riverine interglacial deposits. The mollusk assemblages
  indicate the presence of a large, well-oxygenated river, the proto-Thames, surrounded
  by marsh and flowing through a fully wooded, temperate interglacial landscape. The
  mollusk fauna's composition reflects local changes associated with the river shifting
  its course. The deposits are assigned to Zone CrIIIb of the Cromerian interglacial,
  and declines in the abundance of specimens and species numbers may have a climatic
  cause.
