tldr: The authors present a non-adiabatic model of sonoluminescence, a phenomenon
  where a bubble of air trapped in water emits light when exposed to sound waves.
  They find that as the frequency of the sound waves decreases, the energy from shock
  waves within the bubble increases, leading to higher temperatures and greater luminosity.
  The model incorporates the van der Waals gas law and accounts for the generation
  of shock waves, providing a more accurate representation of the bubble's internal
  state.
