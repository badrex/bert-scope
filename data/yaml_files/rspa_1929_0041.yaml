tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the selective hydrogenation of higher polyethylenic
  esters, focusing on the position of ethylenic linkages in the molecules. They found
  that the process is selective based on the degree of unsaturation and the position
  of the ethylenic linkages. The results have implications for understanding contact
  action at solid surfaces and the potential for improving selective hydrogenation
  processes in the future.
