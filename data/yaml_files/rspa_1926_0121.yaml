tldr: The authors studied the more refrangible band system of cyanogen in active nitrogen.
  They observed modifications in the development of the bands and discussed the possible
  explanations for these changes. The study provides insights into the behavior of
  molecules in different environments and contributes to the understanding of molecular
  physics and chemistry.
