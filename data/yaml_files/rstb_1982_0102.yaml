tldr: The article discusses the structure and expression of human IFN-α genes. The
  authors describe the process of cloning the IFN-α cDNA and the identification of
  different IFN-α cDNAs with distinct target cell specificities. They also explore
  the classification of IFN-α genes into two major subfamilies and their relationship
  with other genes in higher organisms. The study provides insights into the development
  of interferons in E. coli and the expression of the chromosomal gene for HuIFN-α
  in mouse L cells.
