tldr: Researchers used light-beating spectroscopy to study motion in locust nerve
  ganglia. They discovered that exposing the ganglia to high-potassium solutions or
  electrical stimulation increased the level of motion within the preparation. The
  findings suggest that depolarization induces particle motion in nerve cells and
  may be related to a partial liquefaction of the axoplasm caused by calcium ions
  entering the cells.
