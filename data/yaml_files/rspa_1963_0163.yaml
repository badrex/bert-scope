tldr: The authors studied the kinetics of methane formation during the pyrolysis of
  ethane and found that the dissociation of ethane into methyl radicals is a first-order
  process. They concluded that the primary process for methane formation is the unimolecular
  dissociation of ethane, and the initiation of radical chains by this reaction is
  a first-order process under their experimental conditions. The overall ethane pyrolysis
  is accelerated by inert gases due to the acceleration of the unimolecular reaction.
  The authors also determined the activation energy associated with the dissociation
  of ethane and found it to be in excellent agreement with thermochemical estimates.
