tldr: This article provides a brief explanation of Dr. Alexander Stuart's discoveries
  about the heart's muscular structure and function. Dr. Stuart found that the heart
  is a single muscle with parallel fibers, and its contraction is caused by the influx
  of arterial blood rather than nervous spirits. This understanding of the heart's
  anatomy and function has implications for understanding blood circulation and heart
  health.
