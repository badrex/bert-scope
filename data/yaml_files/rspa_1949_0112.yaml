tldr: The authors discovered that pure xylene can spontaneously emulsify in an aqueous
  solution of a detergent, such as dodecylamine hydrochloride, through mere adsorption
  at the interface. This process occurs without external agitation or force and is
  influenced by the concentration of the detergent solution. The emulsion formed consists
  of spherical droplets, and the energy required for emulsification comes from the
  adsorption and solubilization of the hydrocarbon in the aqueous detergent.
