tldr: The author investigates the energy output of dock laborers during heavy work
  by measuring their carbon dioxide discharge. They compare two methods for determining
  energy output and discuss the advantages and limitations of each. The study finds
  that the energy output can be effectively measured by short samples of expired air,
  providing a useful tool for assessing the physical demands of various types of work.
