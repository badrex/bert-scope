tldr: The authors conducted an experimental investigation of the self-heating that
  accompanies the exothermic decomposition of gaseous diethyl peroxide. They recorded
  temperature histories at 19 positions in a spherical vessel using a fine platinum/platinum-rhodium
  thermocouple. The results showed that the reactant was hotter than the vessel, with
  the highest temperature at the center. The authors determined the thermal conductivity
  of the peroxide and the stoichiometry and exothermicity of the decomposition. The
  findings were used to analyze the temperature history and understand the chemical
  properties of the system.
