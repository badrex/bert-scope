  and Myxicola'

tldr: The study investigates the respiratory significance of the crown in two polychaete
  worms, Sabella pavonina and Myxicola infundibulum. It explores the crown's role
  in supplying oxygen to the worms, particularly in the absence of tube irrigation.
  The research finds that the crown can provide oxygen to the hind parts of the worms
  when tube irrigation is not possible, and that the worms' ability to survive and
  regenerate after injury to the anterior end is different in each species.
