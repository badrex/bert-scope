tldr: The article is a biography of Kurt Alfred Georg Mendelssohn, a prominent physicist
  who made significant contributions to low-temperature physics and cryogenics. Born
  into a family with a strong intellectual tradition, Mendelssohn was encouraged by
  his father to explore science from a young age. He attended the University of Berlin
  and began his research under the supervision of his cousin Franz Simon, who was
  known for his work in low-temperature physics. Mendelssohn's research focused on
  the specific heat of solid hydrogen at extremely low temperatures, which provided
  new insights into the behavior of matter at these temperatures. He later moved to
  Breslau with Simon and continued his research, making important contributions to
  the field of low-temperature physics.
