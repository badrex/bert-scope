tldr: The authors studied the deuterium-neopentane exchange reaction over palladium
  supported on silica-alumina particles. They found that the product distribution
  of isomers is influenced by the competition between desorption, diffusion, and surface
  exchange. The theory based on a single-step surface mechanism can explain the wide
  variety of product distributions observed over the same catalyst. The results provide
  insights into the effects of desorption and diffusion on the kinetics of complex
  reactions.
