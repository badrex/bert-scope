tldr: The author analyzed the chemical composition of various resins, such as jalap,
  labdanum, Berengela, Retin asphalt, ammonia, opoponax, and assafoetida. They found
  that resins undergo partial decomposition when heated, sometimes producing benzoic
  acid. The author concluded that resins should be considered as analogous groups
  of compounds with similar radicals, and provided modified formulas for different
  types of resins.
