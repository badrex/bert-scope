tldr: The author explores the use of complex variables in quantum mechanics, showing
  that representing states and dynamical variables with complex variables can provide
  mathematical advantages and power for solving specific examples. The paper also
  discusses the integration process in quantum mechanics, including how to handle
  singularities and the role of analytical continuation.
