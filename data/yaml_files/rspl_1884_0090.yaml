tldr: In this article, the author clarifies a misunderstanding regarding the originality
  of his work on classes of invariants and their relation to Sir James Cockle's research.
  He also briefly discusses Claude Bernard and Heidenhain's observations on nerve
  and gland physiology, specifically the effects of sectioning the chorda tympani
  nerve on saliva secretion in the submaxillary glands.
