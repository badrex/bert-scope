tldr: The author presents a method to measure surface tension in liquids using a micrometer
  syringe. The technique can also be applied to observe the changes in surface tension
  in newly-formed surfaces of hydrophilic colloid solutions and saponin solutions.
  The slow changes in surface tension are attributed to diffusion of molecules, while
  rapid changes are due to changes in concentration.
