tldr: The authors studied the behavior of palladium in occluding hydrogen and oxygen.
  They found that palladium black, sponge, and foil have different properties in absorbing
  gases. The heat evolved during the occlusion of hydrogen was measured, and the atomic
  ratio of palladium to hydrogen was determined for various forms of palladium. The
  results suggest that the occlusion of hydrogen by palladium is a true phenomenon
  of oxidation.
