tldr: This study investigates the changes in iron and steel at temperatures below
  280°C, focusing on electrical resistivity and thermoelectric power. The authors
  observed several thermal evolutions and changes in resistance, which they attribute
  to the complex nature of iron and steel alloys. They also discuss the importance
  of these findings in understanding the mechanical properties of these materials.
