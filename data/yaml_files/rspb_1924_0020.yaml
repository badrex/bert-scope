tldr: The authors developed a sensitive method to observe changes in electrical conductivity
  in single hygroscopic fibers, specifically cotton hairs. They found that the conductivity-time
  curves can be used to study the effects of changing atmospheric conditions on the
  moisture content of fibers. This method provides valuable information about the
  mechanism of moisture absorption in hygroscopic materials.
