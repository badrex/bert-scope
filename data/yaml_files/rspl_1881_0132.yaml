tldr: The author investigates the reaction of ethylene chlorhydrin on the bases of
  the pyridine series and quinoline, resulting in the formation of oxygenated quaternary
  bases. The author synthesizes and studies the properties of these new compounds,
  including chloroplatinates, chloroaurates, and chlorides, providing insights into
  their chemical and physical characteristics.
