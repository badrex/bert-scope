tldr: The authors conducted molecular dynamics simulations of model systems of 256
  rigid, homonuclear diatomic molecules interacting through atom-atom and quadrupole-quadrupole
  potentials. They studied the effects of these potentials on the structure and properties
  of diatomic liquids, finding that the addition of a quadrupole term significantly
  changes the structure and thermodynamic properties of the system.
