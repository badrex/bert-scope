tldr: The authors conducted experiments using water cultures to study the soil solution
  and its impact on plant growth. They found that all cultivable soils contain a nutrient
  solution of approximately constant composition, which is usually sufficient for
  plant growth. The addition of soluble fertilizers does not permanently affect the
  concentration of the soil solution, as it quickly reacts with the minerals present
  in the soil. The observed differences in soil fertility are mainly due to the varying
  capacity of soils to maintain a supply of water to the plants. The response of the
  crop to specific fertilizers may be attributed to their precipitating or inhibiting
  action on plant toxins.
