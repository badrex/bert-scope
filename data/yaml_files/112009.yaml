tldr: The author presents a theorem on the resolubility of indeterminate equations,
  including those of Legendre and Gauss. The theorem applies to both real and complex
  integers and is applicable when coefficients and indeterminates are involved in
  forms contained in the same genus. The theorem is equally applicable whether the
  coefficients and indeterminates are real integers or complex integers of the type
  p + qi.
