tldr: The authors studied the magnetic dipole and electric quadrupole moments of dysprosium
  isotopes 161 and 163 using paramagnetic resonance. They observed the spectra in
  dysprosium acetate and double nitrate crystals and determined the nuclear magnetic
  moments and estimated the nuclear electric quadrupole moments. This research provided
  more reliable values for these moments and helped understand the electronic ground
  state of dysprosium ions in the salt.
