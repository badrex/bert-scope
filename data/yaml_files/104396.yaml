tldr: A letter from John Fuller describes a terrifying thunderclap and possible lightning
  event in Sussex. The sound was so loud that it shook houses 20 miles apart, and
  people initially thought it was the explosion of nearby powder mills. The author
  seeks information on whether the event was felt or seen in London.
