tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the amount of light reflected
  by metallic surfaces, specifically silver, steel, tin, and speculum metal. They
  used a photometer to compare the intensity of light reflected by the metals at different
  angles of incidence. The results showed that the amount of reflected light varied
  depending on the type of metal and the angle of incidence. This research contributed
  to the understanding of how light interacts with metallic surfaces.
