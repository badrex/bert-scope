tldr: The article investigates the forced flow of a rotating viscous liquid heated
  from below, focusing on the symmetrical forced flow. The study finds that the relative
  forced flow tends to become zonal in character when the vessel rotates at a sufficiently
  high angular velocity. The zonal motion is primarily in the direction of rotation,
  except near the outer portion of the fluid, where it is in the opposite direction.
  This phenomenon has significant meteorological implications.
