tldr: Dominant male fairy-wrens tolerate helpers due to increased opportunities for
  cuckoldry. The presence of helpers reduces the dominant male's workload during the
  nestling period, allowing them to increase the rate of extra-territorial forays
  to court nearby females. DNA fingerprinting reveals that males in groups are more
  likely to obtain extra-group fertilizations, which may compensate for lost paternity
  on their own territory.
