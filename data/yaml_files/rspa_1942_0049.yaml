tldr: This article investigates the photocombination of hydrogen and chlorine in oxygen-free
  systems, focusing on the chain reactions, quantum efficiency, and the effects of
  varying light intensity and gas pressures. The authors propose a hypothesis for
  the chain-ending processes and discuss the role of intermediates in the reaction.
