tldr: The author presents a method to derive Green-type, transitional, and uniform
  asymptotic expansions from differential equations, focusing on modified Bessel functions
  of large order. The study involves reformulating the problem and using the Mellin
  transform to find expansions for these functions, providing solutions valid in various
  regions.
