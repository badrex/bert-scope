tldr: The article discusses the potential for genetic manipulation of Rubisco, an
  essential enzyme for photosynthesis. It explores the use of site-directed mutagenesis
  and hybrid enzymes to create useful genetic variations. The authors also examine
  the possibilities of transferring genes between species and the importance of understanding
  natural variations in Rubisco's properties.
