tldr: This article investigates the propagation of surface waves in transversely isotropic
  elastic media. The authors use the Barnett-Lothe theory to study the behavior of
  surface waves and determine the surface-wave speed. They find that unique subsonic
  surface waves usually exist, and the properties of these waves are different for
  various configurations and exceptional transonic states. This research provides
  a better understanding of surface-wave propagation in anisotropic elastic materials.
