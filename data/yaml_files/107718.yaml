tldr: The author compares barometrical and trigonometrical methods to determine the
  height of a hill at Spitzbergen. They use a barometer made by Mr. Jones and a mountain
  barometer made by Mr. Newman to measure the height. The author also discusses the
  challenges they faced during the measurements and the corrections needed for the
  barometers. The trigonometrical method involved using a repeating circle and calculating
  the angles to determine the height of the hill.
