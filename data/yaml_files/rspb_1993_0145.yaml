tldr: The author argues that detectable polymorphism in host resistance and parasite
  host range is a poor guide to the true specificity of a host-parasite interaction.
  They propose the matching-allele model, which is based on the currently favored
  elicitor-receptor model for the biochemistry of plant-pathogen recognition, as an
  alternative to the gene-for-gene model. The matching-allele model can lead to inferred
  patterns of resistance and virulence that appear similar to the gene-for-gene specificity,
  making it difficult to reconstruct both specificity and population history from
  patterns of resistance among host-parasite pairs in a sample.
