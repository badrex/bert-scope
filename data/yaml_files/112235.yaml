tldr: This article explores the properties of numbers and their divisibility by examining
  the results of combining different series in a square. The author demonstrates how
  each term in the square can be divided into four squares, with specific relationships
  between the roots of the terms. This method can be used to find the roots of all
  terms in the series, and the author also discusses the application of this method
  to numbers of the form 2n + 1.
