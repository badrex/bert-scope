tldr: The authors investigated the spectrum of selenium and focused on the structure
  of the singly ionized atom (Se II). They classified over 200 lines, which make up
  the quartet and doublet systems characteristic of Se II. The study provides insights
  into the atomic structure and spectral analysis of selenium, contributing to the
  understanding of its properties and potential applications.
