tldr: The author investigates the stability of various dome forms, including Gothic,
  parabolic, elliptical, and ogival, using mathematical formulas. They analyze the
  weakest joint positions and horizontal thrusts for each type of dome, providing
  insights into the design and construction of stable domes. The study also includes
  a spherical dome with non-uniform thickness, offering recommendations for pier thickness
  and stability equations.
