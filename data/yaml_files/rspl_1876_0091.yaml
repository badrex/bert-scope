tldr: The author analyzes the daily range of atmospheric temperature recorded at Kew
  Observatory from 1855 to 1875, and investigates the relationship between sunspot
  activity and temperature variations. They find that the daily temperature range
  is greatest during years of maximum sunspot frequency and suggest that solar activity
  may play a role in meteorological phenomena.
