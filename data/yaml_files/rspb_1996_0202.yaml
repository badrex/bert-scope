tldr: The author applies Euler buckling theory to the human lumbar spine, considering
  it as a vertical column that can buckle under an axial load and undergo periodic
  motion when displaced by a lateral force. The study suggests that the flexed spine
  resembles an Euler pendulum, and the bending stiffness of the lumbar spine can be
  estimated from previous studies on cadaveric spines. The model helps explain the
  dynamics of the spine and the role of muscles in controlling movement and shock
  absorption.
