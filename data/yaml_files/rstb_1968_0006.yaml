tldr: This study investigates the habitat and area effects on the polymorphism of
  the snail species Cepaea nemoralis and C. hortensis. The authors found that both
  species show morph frequency variation with habitat and area effects, with the most
  cryptic morphs being more common in specific habitats. The variation in morph frequencies
  is best explained by visual selection, and area effects are mainly observed in upland
  localities. The research supports the idea that these effects are maintained by
  selection.
