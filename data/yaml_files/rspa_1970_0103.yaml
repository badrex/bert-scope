tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition produced by the release of
  elastic strain energy during the fracture of brittle crystalline solids. The authors
  experimentally measure the decomposition in calcium, magnesium, and lead carbonates,
  as well as sodium and lead azides. They relate the amounts of decomposition to fracture
  velocity and the kinetics of thermal decomposition, deducing a figure for the crack
  tip temperature in each case. The results are discussed in terms of the relative
  plastic properties of the materials and the energetics of the decomposition processes.
