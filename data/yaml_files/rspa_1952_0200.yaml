tldr: The authors studied the carbon monoxide-steam reaction on coconut charcoal with
  and without extracted impurities. They found that impurities significantly increased
  the reaction rate and altered its kinetic relationships. The extracted charcoal
  showed a fractional order with respect to carbon monoxide and steam, while the original
  charcoal had a higher order with respect to carbon monoxide and a lower order with
  respect to steam. This suggests that impurities provide a more reactive surface
  for the oxidation of carbon monoxide by steam.
