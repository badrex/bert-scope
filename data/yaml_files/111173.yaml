tldr: This article provides a detailed description of the anatomy and physiology of
  the Doris, a type of Nudibranchiate Mollusca. The authors examine various species
  of Doris and describe their digestive, reproductive, circulatory, respiratory, and
  nervous systems. They also discuss the sensory organs of Doris, including the auditory
  capsules, eyes, and olfactory organs. The study concludes that the high organization
  of Doris suggests that the genus will need to be divided into several groups.
