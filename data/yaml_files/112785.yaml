tldr: The author discusses the synthesis and properties of furfuraniline and furfurtoluidine,
  two compounds derived from aniline and furfurol. These compounds form colored salts
  with various metal ions, and their properties are compared to those of rosaniline.
  The author also explores the reaction of furfurol with other aromatic bases, such
  as naphthylamine, but does not obtain crystalline products.
