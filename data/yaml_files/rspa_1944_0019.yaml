tldr: The authors studied the thermal decomposition of acetone and found evidence
  of a free radical chain mechanism. They discovered that propylene inhibits the reaction,
  while nitric oxide does not, suggesting that both inhibitors can largely suppress
  the chain reaction, leaving a residual reaction of non-chain nature. The acetone
  chain reaction is found to be of the first order, and the results indicate that
  the mean chain length in the acetone chain decomposition is less than in other decompositions.
