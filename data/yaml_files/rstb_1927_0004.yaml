tldr: The authors study the morphology and classification of Rhacopteris ferns from
  the Lower Carboniferous period. They analyze the structure and characteristics of
  these fern-like fronds and discuss their possible relationship to modern ferns or
  Pteridosperms. The discovery of a fossil with a connected stem and fronds provides
  valuable information about the growth and structure of these ancient plants.
