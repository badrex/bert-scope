tldr: The authors conducted spectroscopic experiments to investigate the interaction
  between boron trichloride and active nitrogen. They discovered a new band spectrum
  of boron nitride and analyzed its properties, including its complex structure and
  the numerical relations between its bands. This research contributes to the understanding
  of the chemistry and properties of boron nitride and its potential applications.
