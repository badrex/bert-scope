tldr: The author, Edward Wright, examines the Orthoceratites, a type of marine fossil,
  and discusses their distribution and geological context. He challenges the theories
  of Buffon and the author of Telliamed, who believe that the earth was covered in
  water for thousands of years, leading to the gradual formation of fossils. Wright
  argues that Orthoceratites and other marine fossils are found near the surface,
  suggesting a sudden catastrophic event, such as the biblical flood, transported
  them there. He also notes that mountains, which are composed of vitrifiable matter,
  do not contain marine fossils, further refuting Buffon's theory that they were formed
  by sea currents.
