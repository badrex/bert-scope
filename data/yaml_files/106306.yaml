tldr: The author presents a demonstration of two theorems related to polygons, specifically
  regarding the angles and perpendiculars within them. The theorems involve the relationship
  between the exterior angles, perpendiculars, and the radius of the polygon. These
  theorems can be used to calculate the values of the perpendiculars and the intercepted
  parts of the polygon.
