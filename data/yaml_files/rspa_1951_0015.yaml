tldr: The authors investigated the structure of synthetic polypeptides using X-ray
  diffraction on oriented fibers and films. They discovered that polypeptides can
  exist in a folded (a) and an extended (P) configuration. The findings on the a-form
  are consistent with the presence of a twofold screw axis in symmetrical polypeptides,
  leading to a value of about 5.5 Ã… for the true fiber repeat distance. The transformation
  between the a and P forms is influenced by the medium from which the peptide is
  regenerated.
