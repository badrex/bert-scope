tldr: This study investigates the hydrolysis of cane sugar by dilute acids and challenges
  the previously accepted views on the subject. The author finds that the rate of
  change does not follow a linear function of time, and the mass action equation,
  when applied in the usual way, can lead to errors and misleading results. The author
  concludes that there is no evidence to support the idea that the action of dilute
  acids is analogous to that of an enzyme used in small proportions.
