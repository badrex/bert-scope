tldr: The authors studied the catalytic actions of solid surfaces, specifically the
  interaction between copper and nickel in promoting catalytic activity. They discovered
  that when copper and nickel are chemically associated in a complex carbonate molecule,
  the nickel can be reduced at lower temperatures, enhancing the catalyst's efficiency.
  This finding sheds light on the role of promoters in catalysis and the importance
  of surface chemistry in determining catalytic activity.
