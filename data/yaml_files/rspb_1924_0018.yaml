tldr: The author conducted experiments with bacteria and glycerine to study their
  fermenting powers. They discovered that the addition of formates greatly increased
  the activity of bacterial fermentation and revealed latent fermenting powers in
  bacteria. The results showed that bacteria can ferment substances with two, three,
  four, and six carbon atoms, and the presence of formates allowed for a more efficient
  decomposition of carbohydrates.
