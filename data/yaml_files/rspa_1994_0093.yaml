tldr: This study investigates the propagation of detonation waves in rough tubes,
  focusing on the effects of frictional drag on the wave's behavior. The authors use
  the unsteady quasi-one-dimensional reactive Euler equations to analyze the competition
  between chemical energy release and frictional drag, which can lead to oscillatory
  detonation behavior and the non-existence of a steady wave solution. The research
  provides insights into the dynamics of detonation waves and their interaction with
  the surrounding environment.
