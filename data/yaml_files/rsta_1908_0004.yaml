tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the discharge of negative electricity
  from hot calcium and lime. They found that the negative leak from calcium was much
  larger than from platinum, and the negative leak from lime was smaller than from
  calcium. The authors also discovered a curious increase in the negative leak when
  the cathode was left in a vacuum for some time, which was connected to the appearance
  of a dark substance on the surface of the platinum strip.
