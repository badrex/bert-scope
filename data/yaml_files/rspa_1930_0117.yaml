tldr: This study investigates the oxidation of copper at low pressures and how it
  is affected by factors such as the condensation of oxygen, evaporation of oxygen,
  diffusion of oxygen through the oxide, and the reaction between oxygen and copper.
  The research focuses on the influence of these processes on the rate of oxidation
  and provides a mathematical equation to describe the low-pressure oxidation of copper.
