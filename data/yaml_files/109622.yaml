tldr: Dr. William Herschel investigates the quantity and velocity of the solar motion
  using a method that involves analyzing the apparent motion of stars. He determines
  that the solar motion holds a middle rank among sidereal velocities and calculates
  its velocity to be 1116992. The study also reveals that the direction of the solar
  motion is towards the opposite of the motion of Arcturus. This research helps to
  establish a connection between the principles of solar and sidereal motions and
  the causes of orbital motions.
