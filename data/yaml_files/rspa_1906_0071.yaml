tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the specific inductive capacities
  of dry paper and solid cellulose. They tested various samples of paper and found
  that the specific inductive capacity was influenced by factors such as density and
  arrangement of cellulose fibers and air spaces. The results provide valuable information
  for understanding the properties of dielectric materials used in electrical insulation.
