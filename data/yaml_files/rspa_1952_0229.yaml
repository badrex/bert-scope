tldr: The authors propose a method for measuring the hydraulic permeability of saturated
  soil in situ, applicable only to soil below the water table. The method uses a pair
  of small wells with a pump to form a water-circulating system, and the difference
  in water levels is related to the rate of flow and soil permeability. This method
  can determine permeabilities in the directions of anisotropy and, when combined
  with another method, calculate axial permeabilities of triaxially anisotropic materials.
