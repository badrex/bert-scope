tldr: The article discusses the unique hedge-like growth habit of Juniperus excelsa
  in the high-altitude Southern Zagros Mountains of Iran. This growth pattern is attributed
  to strong wind, heavy snow cover, loose soil, and the presence of boulders. The
  plants grow by layering and elongating along the direction of the prevailing wind,
  moving uphill a few centimeters each year.
