tldr: The authors present a numerical method for solving the subcritical flow past
  a lifting aerofoil. They introduce the stream function and use a conformal mapping
  to transform the exterior of the aerofoil into the interior of a circle. A uniform
  grid is imposed on the circle, and the modified stream function is put into difference
  form. The iterative method of solution is convergent, and results are presented
  for various aerofoil sections.
