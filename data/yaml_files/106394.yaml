tldr: The author discusses the phenomenon of sexual dimorphism and hermaphroditism
  in animals, focusing on pheasants. They describe cases of pheasants changing their
  secondary sexual characteristics, such as feathers and spurs, later in life. This
  change is not due to a mix of male and female parts but rather a shift in secondary
  properties, which may be influenced by age and certain constitutional factors.
