tldr: This article discusses the principles and applications of dipolar oscillations
  and phase interferometry in solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiments.
  The authors present a general theory of double-resonance interactions based on the
  heteronuclear dipolar Hamiltonian and describe various experiments using dipolar
  modulation and selective dipolar difference spectra to study hydrogen-bonded systems
  and catalytic systems. They also explore phase interferometric techniques to examine
  the motion and structure of sodium ions in alumina.
