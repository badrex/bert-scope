tldr: The author investigates the chemical composition of Boghead Coal distillate,
  a commercial product containing hydrocarbons. Through a series of distillations
  and chemical reactions, the author isolates various hydrocarbons and analyzes their
  properties, providing evidence for their chemical structures and boiling points.
  This study contributes to the understanding of the complex chemical reactions and
  products resulting from the destructive distillation of organic substances.
