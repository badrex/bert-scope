tldr: The author conducted experiments to directly measure the amplitude of the minimum
  audible impulsive sound without extrapolation. They found that the minimum audible
  amplitude for a sensitive ear is 0.7 / qa, which refers to a telephone of usual
  construction with a diaphragm fundamental of about 580. This research helps improve
  our understanding of sound measurement and audibility.
