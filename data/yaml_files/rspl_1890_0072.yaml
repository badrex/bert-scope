tldr: The author discusses the theory of thin elastic shells and vibrations, focusing
  on the extensional and bending vibrations. They explain the importance of considering
  the extension of the middle surface in the deformation process and the need to satisfy
  the boundary conditions at the free edges of the shell. The author also reviews
  and critiques previous theories by other scientists, such as Lord Rayleigh, Mr.
  Basset, and Professor Lamb, and suggests a method of approximation for solving the
  problem.
