tldr: This article discusses the alternative hypothesis of ancestral transfer of symbionts
  between cockroaches and termites, suggesting that protozoan transfer between their
  ancestors could have occurred under natural conditions. The author responds to concerns
  raised by Nalepa and reiterates the validity of the ancestral transfer hypothesis,
  focusing on the opportunities for interactions in Palaeozoic habitats and the role
  of laboratory experiments in understanding ancestral behaviors.
