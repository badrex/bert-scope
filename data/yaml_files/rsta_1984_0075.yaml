tldr: The article presents a survey of octahedral structures in chemical compounds,
  focusing on structures built from regular octahedra that share vertices, edges,
  or faces. The study classifies these structures based on the coordination numbers
  of the X atoms and explores their topology, providing insights into the geometrically
  possible structures and their relationships with known compounds.
