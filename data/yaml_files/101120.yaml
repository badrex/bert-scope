tldr: The author, Sir Sam Moreland, describes the development of the Speaking Trumpet,
  an instrument designed to amplify sound for communication over long distances. The
  trumpet was tested at Deal Castle and found to be effective in transmitting voices
  up to three miles away. The author explains the principles behind the trumpet's
  design and suggests further improvements for its development. The Speaking Trumpet
  has various applications, including communication between ships at sea, military
  signaling, and coordinating large groups of people.
