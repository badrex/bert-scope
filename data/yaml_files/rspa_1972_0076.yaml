tldr: The authors conducted Raman scattering experiments on rare-earth compounds and
  developed a detailed theory to explain the Jahn-Teller induced phase transitions.
  They found that the phonon spectra remain mostly unchanged, while the electronic
  spectra show significant changes during the phase transitions. The theory accounts
  for the observed behavior, including the splitting of the doubly degenerate phonon
  modes and the coupling between lattice displacements and electronic states.
