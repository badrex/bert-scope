tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the factors affecting water's
  ability to be cooled below its freezing point. They discovered that water's transparency
  and the presence of certain substances can impact its cooling properties. Additionally,
  the author found that chemical solutions can lower water's freezing point and affect
  its ability to be cooled below that point.
