tldr: The authors examined the infra-red spectra of synthetic polypeptides with small
  side chains, such as polymers of glycine and alanine. They observed the low-frequency
  region in the spectrum and made some observations on the CH stretching modes in
  poly-L-alanine. The results provide insights into the structure and properties of
  these polypeptides and their relationship to silk fibers.
