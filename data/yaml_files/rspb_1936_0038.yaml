tldr: The authors developed a convenient method for obtaining bovine arterial blood
  through the internal iliac artery, which allowed them to study the composition of
  blood entering and leaving the mammary gland. This technique helped researchers
  understand the precursors in the blood for milk fat and other milk constituents,
  contributing to the knowledge of mammary secretion and physiology.
