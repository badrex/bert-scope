tldr: The study investigates the rate at which tetrodotoxin affects sodium conductance
  in the squid giant axon. The researchers found that the rate is slower than in the
  isolated node of Ranvier, due to tetrodotoxin binding sites acting as a saturable
  sink in series with the barrier to free diffusion imposed by the Schwann cell. This
  discovery helps estimate the number of sodium channels in the squid giant axon,
  which is crucial for understanding its function and potential applications.
