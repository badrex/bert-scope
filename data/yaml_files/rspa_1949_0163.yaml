tldr: The authors investigate the properties of one-dimensional dislocations and the
  influence of the second harmonic term in the potential representation. They find
  that when the amplitude of the second harmonic term is large, a complete dislocation
  splits into two halves, affecting the equilibrium separation and stability conditions.
  This study has implications for understanding dislocations in materials science
  and crystallography.
