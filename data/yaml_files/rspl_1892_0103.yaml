tldr: The author conducted experiments on ligaturing the bile ducts and observed significant
  enlargement of the perivascular lymph spaces in the liver. They concluded that bile
  can only reach the blood through the intervention of the lymphatics, and cannot
  pass through the endothelium of the blood capillaries.
