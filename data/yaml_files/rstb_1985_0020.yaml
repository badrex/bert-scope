tldr: This article explores the conditions that promote innovative behavior in primates,
  focusing on social, ecological, and temporal factors. It suggests that complex social
  life, free time, and energy are key factors that contribute to the development of
  intelligence and learning in primates. The study highlights examples from both captive
  and wild primate groups, emphasizing the importance of understanding these conditions
  to better comprehend the evolution of primate intelligence.
