tldr: The authors successfully isolated and studied the properties of 1∙6 S-histone,
  a protein found in calf thymocytes. They determined its amino acid composition and
  some of its physicochemical properties, including its molecular weight. This histone
  is different from other histones in its amino acid composition and has unique properties,
  such as its ability to aggregate under certain conditions. The study provides insights
  into the structure and function of this important protein.
