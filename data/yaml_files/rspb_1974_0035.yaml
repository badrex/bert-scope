tldr: The authors present evidence of a five-stranded microfibril in collagen with
  a diameter of 3.7-4.0 nm and a D-period of 66.8 nm. This structure is found in reprecipitated
  cartilage collagen and is likely the five-stranded microfibril suggested by Smith
  (1968). The findings contribute to our understanding of the arrangement of collagen
  molecules within filaments.
