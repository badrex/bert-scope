tldr: The authors investigate the elastic properties of single Pintsch crystals of
  tungsten using dynamical methods. They observe the periodic times of oscillation
  in torsion and bending of wires with various orientations to determine the Torsional
  Modulus of Rigidity and the Longitudinal Young's Modulus. The results show that
  tungsten crystals exhibit very nearly isotropic elastic properties, with small variations
  in orientation.
