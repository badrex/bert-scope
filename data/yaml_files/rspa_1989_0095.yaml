tldr: This article analyzes the sound and structural vibrations produced by a large-eddy
  break-up device (LEBU) in turbulent flow over a flexible wall. The LEBU reduces
  skin friction in the boundary layer, but can also generate significant acoustic
  and structural noise. The study models the wall as a thin, flexible plate and focuses
  on underwater applications where the fluid loading is large. The article provides
  expressions for the frequency spectrum of the radiated sound and the power fed into
  the flexural wall motions by the LEBU, and discusses numerical predictions for turbulent
  flow over a steel plate in water.
