tldr: The authors present a theory of spherical free gravitational waves in Minkowski
  space, focusing on the non-radial oscillations of stars. They derive equations governing
  these perturbations and discuss the implications for understanding the scattering
  of gravitational waves and the behavior of Newtonian stars.
