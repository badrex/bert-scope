tldr: The author, William Spottiswoode, explores the contact of conics with surfaces,
  specifically focusing on principal tangent conics. He establishes a theorem that
  at every point of a surface, ten conics can be drawn having six-pointic contact.
  The paper also discusses the presence of arbitrary quantities and their role in
  determining the position of the plane of section.
