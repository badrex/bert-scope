tldr: The authors study geodesics and pre-geodesics in smooth manifolds with pseudo
  Riemannian metrics that change bilinear type on a hypersurface. They classify geodesics
  and pre-geodesics that cross the hypersurface transversely and apply these results
  to the eikonal partial differential equation, finding geometric conditions for the
  local existence or nonexistence of smooth, transverse solutions.
