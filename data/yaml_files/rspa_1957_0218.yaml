tldr: This paper examines Schwinger's variational principle in quantum mechanics and
  clarifies the class of permissible variations. The authors discuss classical and
  quantum theories of dynamical systems with Lagrangians linear in coordinate derivatives
  and consider linear variations of dynamical variables. They show that these variations
  can be consistently included in Schwinger's formalism and that Green's generalized
  commutation rules can be obtained by excluding number variations from the theory
  for a specific class of Lagrangians.
