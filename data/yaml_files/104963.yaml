tldr: In December 1755, a series of earthquakes shook the frontiers of Europe, causing
  some panic but no major damage. The author, Mons. Allemond, reported that the earthquakes
  were felt in cities like Liege, Maestricht, Nimeguen, and Arnheim. He also mentioned
  that salt springs in Bevieux, Switzerland, became more salty due to the earthquakes.
  A similar event occurred in Amersfort, Utrecht, in January 1755.
