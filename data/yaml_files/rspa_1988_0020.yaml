tldr: This article investigates slip waves along the interface between two anisotropic
  elastic half-spaces in sliding contact. It explores the conditions for the existence
  of slip waves and introduces the possibility of a new slip-wave mode called the
  second slip-wave mode due to elastic anisotropy. The study emphasizes the need for
  a more detailed understanding of the behavior of anisotropic materials in surface-wave
  theory.
