tldr: This article presents a comprehensive study of the gill structure in Lamellibranchia,
  a class of mollusks. The author examines the gills of 215 species across 118 genera,
  providing a detailed analysis of their morphology and classification. The study
  also discusses the importance of accurate species identification for anatomical
  comparisons and proposes a terminology for the constituent parts of the gill.
