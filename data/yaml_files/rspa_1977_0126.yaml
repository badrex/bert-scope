tldr: This article explores the statistical analysis of bivariate point processes
  in electronic counters, focusing on the estimation of the rate of occurrence of
  coincidences and the covariance of the numbers of events recorded on two counters.
  The authors consider the effects of counter dead-time and provide mathematical calculations
  and formulas for these estimations.
