tldr: 'The author, Edward Schunck, investigates the decomposition of rubian, a substance
  found in madder, by alkalies and alkaline earths. He identifies five products of
  decomposition: alizarine, verantine, rubiretine, sugar, and rubiadine. Schunck also
  discovers a ferment, erythrozym, in madder that causes rubian decomposition. This
  study helps understand the formation of colorants in madder and the properties of
  erythrozym.'
