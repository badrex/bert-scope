tldr: The article discusses ozone measurements taken at British Antarctic Survey stations
  in Argentina and Halley Bay since 1957. The authors analyze the relationship between
  total ozone amounts and temperature changes in the lower stratosphere. They also
  examine the breakdown of the winter polar stratospheric vortex and its impact on
  ozone levels. The study finds that long-term trends in total ozone are small at
  both stations, but large fluctuations can occur during the breakdown of the vortex.
