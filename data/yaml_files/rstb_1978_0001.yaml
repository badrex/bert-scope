tldr: The author examines the recent history of Lough Neagh and its drainage basin
  using pollen and diatom analysis of the lake sediment. The study traces the development
  of the lake and its catchment area, discussing vegetational change and the impact
  of cultural activities on the lake's eutrophication. The research also explores
  the sediment accumulation rates, diatom influx, and the emergence of Stephanodiscus
  as the most important diatom genus in the eutrophication stages.
