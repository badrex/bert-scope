tldr: This article introduces the role of calcium channels in plant cells and their
  involvement in various plant cell functions. It highlights the differences between
  plant and animal signal-response coupling mechanisms and the importance of calcium
  as a second messenger and regulator of plant cell processes. The article also discusses
  the current understanding of calcium-selective channels in plant cell membranes
  and their roles in signal transduction and regulation, as well as the potential
  for future research using modern techniques.
