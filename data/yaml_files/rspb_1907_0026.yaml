tldr: The author investigates the relationship between antagonistic muscles and their
  innervation through reflexes. They discovered that afferent nerves from one muscle
  can cause reflex relaxation in its antagonist, while also causing reflex contraction
  in other antagonistic muscles. This phenomenon, called reciprocal innervation, is
  observed in various muscle groups and plays a crucial role in motor control and
  coordination.
