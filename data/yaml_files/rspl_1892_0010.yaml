tldr: The author, Angelo Mosso, investigated the temperature of the brain in relation
  to psychical activity using sensitive mercurial thermometers. He observed that during
  sleep, even slight sensory stimuli can cause a slight increase in brain temperature.
  The brain's temperature can also be affected by various anaesthetics and narcotics,
  which may suspend the chemical functions of nerve cells. Mosso concluded that the
  physical basis of psychical processes is likely chemical action.
