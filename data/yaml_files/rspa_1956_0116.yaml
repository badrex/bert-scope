tldr: The authors investigate the possibility of deriving hydromagnetic equations
  from the Boltzmann equation for a dilute gas with no interparticle collisions but
  a strong Lorentz force. They find that a strictly hydrodynamic description is possible
  only when certain conditions suppress the third moment of the velocity distribution.
  The electron degrees of freedom can be replaced by a macroscopic current, making
  the problem essentially one-fluid, focusing on ions.
