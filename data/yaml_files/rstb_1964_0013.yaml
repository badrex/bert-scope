tldr: The author investigates the rectal complex of mealworms, specifically the cryptonephric
  condition, where the distal ends of Malpighian tubules are closely applied to the
  rectum. The rectal complex helps in removing water from the faeces by increasing
  the osmotic pressure of the fluid in the perinephric chamber, making it easier for
  the rectal epithelium to absorb water and nutrients from the faecal waste.
