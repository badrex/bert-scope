tldr: This article examines the research conducted by Michael Faraday on steel alloys
  in the early 19th century. Faraday worked with James Stodart to create a series
  of steel alloys, which they believed could be used for cutting instruments and edge
  tools. The author of this article investigates the historical context of Faraday's
  work and examines the properties of the alloys, concluding that they were a significant
  contribution to the field of metallurgy.
