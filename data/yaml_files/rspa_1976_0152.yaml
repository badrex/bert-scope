tldr: The author studied the osmotic and activity coefficients of 2:2 electrolytes,
  providing a theoretical treatment that combines the Kirkwood-Glueckauf-Bjerrum function
  and a linear ion-water interaction term. The study focused on the electrostatic
  and statistical contributions to the activity coefficients, leading to a better
  understanding of the behavior of highly hydrated ions in concentrated solutions.
  The findings can be applied to improve the representation of activity coefficients
  in strong solutions of other electrolytes or mixtures.
