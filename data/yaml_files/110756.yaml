tldr: 'Thomas Exley presents a new theory of physics based on two propositions: every
  atom of matter consists of an immense sphere of force, and atoms differ in their
  absolute forces or their spheres of repulsion. He assumes four classes of atoms
  and explains the general attributes of matter and body with the Newtonian laws of
  motion.'
