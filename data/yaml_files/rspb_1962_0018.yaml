tldr: The authors studied the distribution of antibody activity in hedgehog serum
  after immunization with Brucella abortus and Salmonella pullorum. They found that
  after a single immunizing injection, most of the antibody activity was in the /?-globulin
  fraction, while after prolonged immunization, the antibody activity was still predominantly
  in the /?-globulin fraction. However, when hedgehogs were immunized with Salmonella
  pullorum, the antibody activity was fairly evenly distributed between the /?- and
  y-globulins. The results suggest that the distribution of antibody activity in hedgehog
  serum may explain the differential postnatal transmission of passive immunity in
  this species.
