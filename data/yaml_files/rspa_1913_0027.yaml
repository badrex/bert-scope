tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the magnetic behavior of iron and
  other metals under oscillatory discharge from a condenser. They discovered that
  the damping factor is affected by the self-induction and the introduction of iron
  wire cores. The results showed that hysteresis loss is negligible compared to eddy-current
  loss, and the permeability of iron remains similar at high frequencies as under
  steady magnetic fields.
