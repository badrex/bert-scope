tldr: This article discusses the performance and challenges of fast-neutron breeder
  fission reactor fuel. It highlights the physical phenomena affecting fuel behavior,
  such as fuel swelling, fuel cladding interaction, clad swelling, fuel behavior under
  transients, and subassembly behavior in a reactor core. The article also reviews
  the predictable performances of mixed oxide breeder fuel and addresses the challenges
  in achieving high burn-ups of the fuel used in fast-neutron reactors.
