tldr: This study investigates the impact of genotype-by-environment interaction on
  the fitness of Chlamydomonas algae strains. The researchers cultured the strains
  in different macroenvironments created by manipulating nutrient levels in the growth
  media. They found that a large proportion of the overall genotypic variance in fitness
  measures was due to genotype-by-environment interaction. This interaction was caused
  by incomplete genetic correlation and differences in genetic variance among genotypes.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between genotypes
  and environments for better population growth and management.
