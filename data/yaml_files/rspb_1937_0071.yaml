tldr: The authors studied the thermoelastic properties of muscle and their molecular
  interpretation. They found that muscle contraction and stretching involve changes
  in internal energy and entropy, which can be related to the molecular structure
  and arrangement of muscle fibers. The results suggest that muscle fibers are made
  up of chain molecules with strong bonds in one direction and more fluid-like properties
  in others, leading to a unique rubber-like state.
