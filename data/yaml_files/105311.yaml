tldr: The author, John Andrew Peyssonel, observed and described the structure and
  growth habits of the Alga Marina Latifolia, a large sea alga with broad leaves.
  He provided detailed information about the plant's root system, leaves, and the
  way it floats in water. Peyssonel also mentioned the presence of small living muscles
  and starfish in the plant's environment, suggesting that the sea-water might be
  carrying their seminal matter.
