tldr: This article discusses the advancements and applications of genetically transformed
  plants. It covers various techniques for gene transfer, transformation of different
  crops, and the potential for crop improvement through molecular biological methods.
  The authors also explore the control of gene expression, carbohydrate metabolism,
  fruit ripening, and plant responses to environmental stress and pathogens. Additionally,
  they touch upon the commercial benefits of these discoveries, such as insect- and
  virus-resistant crops and improved tomato ketchup.
