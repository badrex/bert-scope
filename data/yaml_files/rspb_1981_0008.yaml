tldr: The study investigates respiratory water loss in camels exposed to extreme heat
  and water deprivation. It found that camels can regulate their respiratory water
  loss by exhaling air at temperatures below their body temperature and removing water
  vapor from the exhaled air, resulting in less water loss. This helps camels maintain
  their body temperature and conserve water in harsh desert conditions.
