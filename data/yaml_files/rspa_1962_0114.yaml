tldr: The authors developed an apparatus to measure the second virial coefficients
  of vapours in alkanes, using a differential method that compares the gas under investigation
  with a reference gas. They measured the second virial coefficients of a series of
  alkanes from propane to octane and found that they deviate from the principle of
  corresponding states, with deviations increasing with chain length. The results
  support a formula based on the principle of corresponding states and show better
  agreement with a rule of Guggenheim and McGlashan than with the rule of Lewis and
  Randall.
