tldr: This article is a tribute to Sir Charles Scott Sherrington, a renowned neuroscientist
  who made significant contributions to the understanding of the nervous system. Sherrington's
  work focused on the study of reflexes, the role of afferent and efferent nerve fibers,
  and the concept of reciprocal innervation. His research on the stretch reflex and
  the integrative action of the nervous system has had a lasting impact on the field
  of neurology. Sherrington's work laid the foundation for modern neuroscience and
  his influence can still be seen in the study of the nervous system today.
