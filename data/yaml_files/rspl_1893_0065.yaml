tldr: The author studied the menstrual cycle and ovulation in Semnopithecus entellus,
  a type of monkey. They observed four periods and eight stages of the menstrual cycle,
  which involve changes in the uterus and blood supply. The author found that ovulation
  does not necessarily occur during each menstrual period, and menstruation is not
  caused by ovulation. The function of menstruation may be to prepare the uterus for
  the reception and retention of an ovum.
