tldr: The author presents a new method for solving numerical equations of all orders
  through continuous approximation. This method is based on the leading theorem in
  the Calculus of Derivations and can be applied to various types of equations, including
  finite, irrational, and transcendental ones. The new method offers greater accuracy
  and simplicity compared to popular methods of approximation, as it takes into account
  all the derivatives, not just the first and second ones.
