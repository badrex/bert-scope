tldr: This article discusses the discovery of narrow V-shaped wakes behind surface
  ships observed from space using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images. The traditional
  Kelvin wake geometry, consisting of divergent and transverse wave components, does
  not explain these radar wakes. The authors propose that the wave generation is by
  an intermittent rather than a steady point source, and they explain the observed
  features in terms of Bragg scattering from relatively short waves generated by the
  surface vessel. This study is a step towards interpreting many unexplained naturally
  occurring features at the edge of the Sun glitter.
