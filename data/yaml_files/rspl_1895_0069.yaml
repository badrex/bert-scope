revised_title: Determination of Indices of Refraction for Electric Rays
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Electromagnetic waves
- Refraction
- Total internal reflection
- Index of refraction
- Hertzian waves
tldr: The author describes a method to accurately measure the index of refraction
  for various substances using Hertzian waves, or electric rays. They focus on the
  determination of the index of refraction of sulfur using total internal reflection.
  This method can be applied to other substances that are not transparent to light,
  providing a more accurate understanding of the behavior of electromagnetic waves.
