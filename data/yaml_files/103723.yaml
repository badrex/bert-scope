tldr: In this article, J.T. Desaguliers recounts his experiments and debates with
  Signior Rizzetti regarding Sir Isaac Newton's theory of optics and the different
  refrangibility of light rays. Desaguliers presents a detailed account of Rizzetti's
  book, De Luminis Affectionibus Specimen Physicomathematicum, and addresses the various
  objections raised against Newton's experiments. He also describes the experiments
  he conducted before the Royal Society to support Newton's theories.
