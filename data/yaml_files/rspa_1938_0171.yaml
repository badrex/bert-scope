tldr: This study investigates the different types of flow in a vertical overflow pipe
  for large tanks. The authors describe their experimental setup and findings on the
  effects of pipe size, shape, and head pressure on the flow types, including Borda
  free flow, Borda full flow, and vortex formation. The research provides insights
  into optimizing overflow design for large reservoirs.
