tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of cyanogen, a process that exhibits unique
  behavior compared to other gaseous oxidation phenomena. They found that activated
  carbon monoxide molecules form on the vessel wall and that cyanogen inhibits the
  oxidation of carbon monoxide. The reaction is sensitive to adsorption equilibrium
  and surface conditions, and it is concluded that the primary change takes place
  on the surface.
