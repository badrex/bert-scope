tldr: This study investigates the activation of the nicotinic receptor at the frog
  neuromuscular junction by various cholinergic agonists. The researchers determined
  the dose-response curve for carbachol and compared the properties of six different
  agonists. The potencies and mean open times of these agonists are ranked in the
  same order, but the range of potencies is larger than that of the mean open times.
  The differences in the properties of the different agonists could be due to differences
  in the rate of dissociation of the agonist.
