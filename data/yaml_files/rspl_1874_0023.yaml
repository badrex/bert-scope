tldr: This article discusses a class of identical relations in the theory of elliptic
  functions and the changes in iron and steel properties when exposed to hydrogen
  and acids. The author demonstrates how certain forms of elliptic functions can be
  transformed and presents identical equations related to these transformations. Additionally,
  the article explores the remarkable changes in iron's physical properties when exposed
  to hydrochloric and sulfuric acids, which can cause temporary loss of toughness
  and breaking strain.
