tldr: The authors measured the polarization of light emitted from helium atoms following
  electron impact near the threshold energy. They found that the degree of polarization
  was consistent with theoretical predictions at the threshold energy and decreased
  rapidly at higher energies. This study provides insights into the behavior of light
  emission and polarization near the threshold energy, which is essential for understanding
  atomic processes and spectroscopy.
