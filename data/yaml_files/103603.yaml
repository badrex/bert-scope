tldr: Dr. Nettleton's letter discusses the practice of inoculation for smallpox and
  compares its mortality rates to the natural occurrence of the disease. He shares
  data from various towns, showing that the mortality rate for those who were inoculated
  was significantly lower than those who contracted the disease naturally. This information
  provides insight into the effectiveness of inoculation as a preventive measure against
  smallpox.
