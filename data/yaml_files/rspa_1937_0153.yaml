tldr: The authors conducted experiments using X-ray absorption spectroscopy to study
  the fine-structure of soft X-ray absorption edges in metals like Li, Mg, Ni, and
  Cu. They determined the density of unoccupied energy levels in the metals and observed
  the variations of the absorption coefficient for radiation between 100 and 300 A.
  This research provided insights into the understanding of the complex region where
  the first two Brillouin zones overlap.
