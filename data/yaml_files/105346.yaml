tldr: This article explores the theoretical aspects of engines with uniformly accelerated
  motions, focusing on steam engines. The author, Francis Blake, investigates the
  optimal load and the best distance of the power from the fulcrum of the lever to
  maximize the engine's efficiency. The findings can be applied to improve the performance
  of steam engines and other mechanical systems.
