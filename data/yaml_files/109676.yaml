tldr: In this letter, William Sewell describes the discovery of a canal in the spinal
  cord of various quadrupeds, such as horses, bulls, sheep, pigs, and dogs. This canal
  runs from the brain's fourth ventricle to the spinal cord's center and can be observed
  through a transverse section. Sewell also notes that the canal is lined with a membrane
  similar to the tunica arachnoidea and is most visible near large nerve branches.
