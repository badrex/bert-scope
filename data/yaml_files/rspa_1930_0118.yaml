tldr: This study investigates the effect of surface activation on the limiting pressure
  of copper oxidation. The authors found that activating the copper surface by alternate
  oxidation and reduction increases the limiting pressure. They also discovered that
  deactivation through sintering decreases the limiting pressure. The research provides
  insights into the relationship between activation, limiting pressure, and the oxidation
  process.
