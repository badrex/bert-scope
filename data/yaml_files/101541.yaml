tldr: In 1665, a letter reported the raining of ashes in the Archipelago due to the
  eruption of Mount Vesuvius. The ashfall was observed by multiple ships, and the
  ashes were found to be the same across different locations. This event happened
  over 30 years ago and was documented to prevent the details from being lost.
