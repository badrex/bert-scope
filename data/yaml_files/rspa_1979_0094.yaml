tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of Mn I between 1800 and 700 A,
  revealing 77 new transitions and confirming the validity of the spectator electrons
  model in the 3d and 4s excitation spectra. They compared their findings with ab
  initio Hartree-Fock calculations, providing a framework for analyzing the excitation
  in Mn I.
