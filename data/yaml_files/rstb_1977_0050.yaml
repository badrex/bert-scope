tldr: The authors studied the effects of monocular visual deprivation on ocular dominance
  columns in the monkey's striate cortex. They found that closing one eye in young
  monkeys led to a marked shrinkage of columns belonging to the closed eye and an
  expansion of those belonging to the open eye. This plasticity in the visual system
  suggests that competition between the eyes plays a role in the development of ocular
  dominance columns. The authors also discussed the potential mechanisms behind these
  changes, such as sprouting of terminals or competition between terminals for postsynaptic
  cells.
