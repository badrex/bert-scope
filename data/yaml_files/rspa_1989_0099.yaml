tldr: The authors introduce the concept of quantum computational networks, which are
  the quantum generalization of classical logic circuits. They discuss quantum gates,
  the universal quantum gate, and how computations can be performed using quantum
  gates and networks. The paper also explains the difference between reversible and
  irreversible gates and how reversible gates are essential for quantum computations.
