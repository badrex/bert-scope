tldr: Dr. James Brewer discovered a large bed of oyster shells near Reading in Berkshire.
  He observed the layers of chalk, green sand, and other materials in the area and
  wondered about the origin of the shells, as there was no nearby sea. He also found
  whole and double oysters in the green sand, which were very brittle. The discovery
  of these shells and their geological context could provide insights into the local
  environment and natural resources.
