tldr: This article discusses the equations of the Hartree and Hartree-Fock formulations
  for perturbed atomic systems. It presents two methods for solving these equations
  and provides a quantitative assessment of their accuracy by calculating the dipole
  and quadrupole polarizabilities of helium. The author also compares the two methods
  and their respective results, highlighting the advantages and limitations of each
  approach.
