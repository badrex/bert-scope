tldr: The article discusses the active site of the RuBP carboxylase enzyme, which
  plays a crucial role in photosynthesis. The authors identify two essential lysine
  residues in the enzyme and explore their functions. They also describe the use of
  affinity labeling to study the active site and its components, providing insights
  into the mechanism of RuBP carboxylase and its evolution.
