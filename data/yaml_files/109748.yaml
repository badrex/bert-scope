tldr: Thomas Knight presents a mathematical problem of piercing a hemisphere with
  an indefinite number of equal and similar cylinders, ensuring that the remaining
  surface can be exactly quadratured. The solution to this problem, as well as others
  in the preceding communication, was not suitable for public reading.
