tldr: A woman in Dublin expelled a large stone through her urethra, providing a rare
  and remarkable case study in women's health and urology. The author discusses the
  unique anatomy of the female urinary system, which may contribute to the rarity
  of such cases, and suggests that women may not need to undergo invasive surgery
  to remove bladder stones. The author also shares two additional case studies of
  successful non-invasive stone removal in women.
