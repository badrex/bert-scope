tldr: The authors discuss the cognitive capacities of chimpanzees and their ability
  to communicate using systems of signs derived from human language. They argue that
  the impressive results reported on chimpanzee "language" do not refer to the same
  adaptation in chimpanzees as in humans, but rather show that we have underestimated
  their cognitive abilities. The authors also highlight the importance of further
  research to understand the complexities of animal intelligence and communication.
