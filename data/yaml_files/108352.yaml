tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of red, orange, and yellow
  rays on the photographic process. They discovered that these rays reverse the photogenic
  effect, rendering the plate repellant to mercurial vapour. This finding challenges
  the continuing action attributed to these rays by previous researchers and sheds
  light on the differences between the photogenic actions on photogenic papers and
  the Daguerreotype plate.
