tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-rays on mitosis in the spermatogonial
  divisions of the migratory locust, Locusta migratoria. The research shows that X-rays
  cause structural alterations in chromosomes and induce various chromosome abnormalities.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of the biological effects of radiation
  on living organisms.
