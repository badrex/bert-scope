tldr: The author discusses the pattern of radiative heating and cooling in the troposphere
  and lower stratosphere, focusing on the effects of water vapor, carbon dioxide,
  and clouds. They explain how clouds impact the radiation fluxes and the cooling
  rates, and how carbon dioxide radiation affects the temperature at the tropopause.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the radiative conditions of
  clouds and the need for more statistical data on cloud frequency and thickness.
