tldr: The authors, J. H. Conway and N. J. A. Sloane, study perfect lattices or quadratic
  forms in dimensions up to 7. They present a simple proof of the classification of
  perfect lattices in two, three, and four dimensions and determine the automorphism
  groups, orbits of minimal vectors, and eutactic coefficients of these lattices.
  The authors also provide a complete list of known perfect lattices in dimensions
  up to 7 and discuss their properties.
