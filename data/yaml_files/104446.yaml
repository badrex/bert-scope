tldr: The author, Roger Pickering, shares his findings on the use of fossil shells,
  specifically those of the Buccinum vulgar or Whilk, as a form of manure for improving
  agricultural land. He describes the collection of these shells in Woodbridge and
  their successful use in improving crop yields. He also expresses his regret that
  this method of land improvement is not more widely known and encourages others to
  conduct experiments and share their observations with the Royal Society.
