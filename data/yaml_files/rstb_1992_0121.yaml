tldr: The author examines the ultrastructure of the osphradium, a gill-like sense
  organ, in the Tertiary relict snail Campanile symbolicum. The osphradium is composed
  of sensory cells with aberrant cilia and pigment formations, as well as free nerve
  processes. The author discusses the functional and ecological significance of the
  osphradium and its unique features, which reflect the phylogenetic isolation of
  this relict snail.
