tldr: This article discusses the water relations of plants, focusing on the role of
  stomata in regulating water movement and transpiration. The author explains how
  stomata control the uptake of carbon dioxide and water loss, and how this balance
  is crucial for plant survival. The article also explores the differences in water
  potential and resistance in plants and the atmosphere, and how these factors affect
  transpiration rates.
