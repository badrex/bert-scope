tldr: In this article, William Herschel describes his experiments on solar and terrestrial
  rays that cause heat. He discovers that heat-making rays have a greater refrangibility
  than light rays, leading to the discovery of invisible infrared radiation. He also
  demonstrates that the dispersion of heat-making rays and light rays by a prism is
  different, and that achromatic refractions can be used to correct this dispersion.
  This work expanded our understanding of the relationship between heat and light
  and paved the way for further research in the field of optics.
