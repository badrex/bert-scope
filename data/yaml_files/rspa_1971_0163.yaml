tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties of Apollo 12 lunar samples and found
  that the fines contain at least 0.7% by mass of native iron, mainly in the super-paramagnetic
  form at room temperature. The crystalline rocks possess an intermediate-stable natural
  remanent magnetization, indicating the presence of a magnetic field on the Moon
  at the time of rock formation. The Moon likely had an internal magnetic field 3400
  million years ago, which has since decayed.
