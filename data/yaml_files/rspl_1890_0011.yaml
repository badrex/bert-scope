tldr: The author studied the development of the atrial chamber in Amphioxus, a type
  of marine invertebrate. They discovered that the atrial chamber forms from the fusion
  of lateral outgrowths called metapleura, which are not connected to the coelom.
  This finding challenges previous theories about the formation of the atrial chamber
  and its relation to the epipleural walls in adult Amphioxus.
