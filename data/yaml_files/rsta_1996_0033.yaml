tldr: This article discusses the development and implementation of quantum cryptography
  for secure optical communications. The authors review the design considerations
  for practical quantum cryptography systems, focusing on the properties of optical
  fibers and the performance of single-photon detectors. They describe two experimental
  systems and discuss the use of quantum cryptography in multi-user optical networks.
  The article highlights the potential of quantum cryptography to change the way information
  confidentiality and communication network integrity are protected.
