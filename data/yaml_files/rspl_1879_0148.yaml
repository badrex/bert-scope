tldr: The authors discovered a bacterium called Bacterium fœtidum, which is associated
  with profuse sweating and a strong odor from the soles of the feet. They studied
  the growth and development of this bacterium, finding it in the sweat-soaked areas
  of the feet. The bacterium can be found in pairs, single cells, and in various stages
  of development, including spores. The authors also found that Bacterium fœtidum
  grows less actively in turnip infusion compared to vitreous humor.
