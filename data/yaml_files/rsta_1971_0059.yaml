tldr: This article discusses a measurement of the brightness temperature of the Sun
  in the range of 65 to 180 cm^-1 using a Michelson interferometer flown on a balloon
  to a height of 32.6 km. The experiment aimed to study the solar atmosphere and compare
  the results with existing models and observations. The findings provide valuable
  data for understanding the Sun's temperature distribution and its effects on the
  surrounding environment.
