tldr: The author studied the formation of barrier reefs and atolls in various locations
  across the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. They observed that these structures are
  formed through a combination of volcanic activity, erosion, and denudation. The
  author also discussed the role of atmospheric denudation in reducing elevated limestone
  islands and the importance of understanding the geological structure of the underlying
  base for atoll formation.
