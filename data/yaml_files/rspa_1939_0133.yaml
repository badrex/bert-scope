tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of dipropyl peroxide, ethyl hydrogen
  peroxide, and propyl hydrogen peroxide. They find that these peroxides decompose
  differently at various temperatures and pressures, with some decomposing heterogeneously
  and others luminously. The author also studies the reaction rates and products of
  these decompositions, providing insights into the properties and behavior of alkyl
  peroxides.
