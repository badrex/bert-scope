tldr: The authors investigate the rigidity of two types of triangulated hyperbolic
  paraboloidal structures, type 1 with straight boundaries and type 2 with parabolic
  boundaries. They find that both types satisfy Maxwell's rule, but type 1 assemblies
  with even edge numbers and greater than 2, and type 2 assemblies with specific conditions,
  are not rigid. The study provides a general formula for the number of inextensional
  mechanisms and static redundancies in single-sheet triangulated hypars of type 1
  and 2, and extends the findings to four-sheet hypars.
