tldr: This article explores the role of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA) in controlling
  cell growth and differentiation in Dictyostelium discoideum. PKA is essential for
  both prespore and spore gene expression, and it acts to regulate the action of DIF
  in stalk cell differentiation. PKA is also necessary for the morphogenetic movement
  of prestalk cells during culmination. The study suggests the existence of a signaling
  mechanism that converts the progressive signal into discrete, PKA-regulated gene
  activation events.
