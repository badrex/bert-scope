tldr: The article discusses the role of ATP-driven active transport of calcium ions
  in the sarcoplasmic reticulum in regulating muscular contraction. The authors demonstrate
  that the vesicles in the muscle can accumulate small amounts of calcium and reduce
  the free calcium concentration, which is essential for maintaining muscle relaxation.
  The study also shows that the calcium transporting system can store high amounts
  of calcium in pathological conditions and play a crucial role in excitation-contraction
  coupling in skeletal muscles.
