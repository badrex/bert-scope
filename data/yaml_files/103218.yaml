tldr: Dr. Archibald Adams describes the case of a patient who suffered from apoplexy
  due to an obstruction in the left ventricle of the brain. Despite the obstruction
  being in the left ventricle, the patient's right side was affected, and the left
  side had some remaining function. This observation challenges the author's initial
  opinion about the relationship between ventricle obstruction and corresponding side
  effects.
