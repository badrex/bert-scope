tldr: This article examines the role of horizontal wind convergence in concentrating
  flying insects, focusing on the mechanisms that might bring about insect concentrations
  and their application to the operational monitoring of insect populations. The authors
  discuss the importance of windshift lines, radar evidence, and the relationship
  between wind convergence and insect concentration. They also explore the potential
  for improving insect control by seeking out these concentration patterns.
