tldr: The author estimates the net radiation entering or leaving the atmosphere and
  earth's surface at Kew Observatory during May 1953 to April 1954. They compare their
  findings with similar worldwide studies and discuss the albedo of the earth and
  atmosphere at different seasons. The study helps in understanding the local energy
  balance and contributes to the International Geophysical Year 1957-58 project.
