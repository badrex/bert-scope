tldr: The authors describe the synthesis and properties of an electron-ion plasma
  in a steady state, created by injecting opposing beams of charges into a field-free
  region. They study the electric neutrality, electric test fields, and interactions
  between the moving charges in the plasma. The results show resonance absorption
  in an electron-ion plasma and demonstrate the effect of a magnetic field on the
  plasma's transmission and absorption.
