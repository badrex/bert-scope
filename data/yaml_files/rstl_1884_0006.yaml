tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the wave-lengths of lines in the
  spectra of sixteen elementary substances using a goniometer and photography. They
  employed a method similar to Cornu's to obtain accurate measurements and calculated
  wave-lengths for each line. This research aimed to provide a comprehensive record
  of wave-lengths for future workers in the field.
