tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the devitrification of silica glass
  and its resistance to air leakage. They found that devitrification occurs due to
  exposure to high temperatures and contact with radium salts. The silica glass showed
  significant air leakage compared to a glass control, indicating the impact of devitrification
  on its properties.
