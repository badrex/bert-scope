tldr: This article explains the mechanism of a thunderstorm, focusing on the processes
  involved in the formation of lightning and the distribution of electrical charges.
  The author describes how air currents, raindrop behavior, and the breaking and recombining
  of water drops contribute to the accumulation of positive and negative charges,
  ultimately leading to lightning discharges.
