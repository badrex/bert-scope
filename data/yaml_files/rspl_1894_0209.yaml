tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand the effect of soil pH on the
  development of a cabbage disease caused by Plasmodiophora. They found that the disease
  was more developed in soil with an acid reaction and was checked by the presence
  of alkalies like lime. The author also highlighted the importance of preventing
  the growth of weeds that are susceptible to the same disease.
