tldr: The Ariel III satellite measured molecular oxygen distribution in the thermosphere
  by observing the attenuation of solar radiation. The experiment used ionization
  chambers to detect molecular oxygen, which has a strong absorption at a wavelength
  of about 145 nm. The data collected during the first 10 days of operation showed
  a large and systematic variation with longitude, providing valuable insights into
  the thermosphere's molecular oxygen distribution.
