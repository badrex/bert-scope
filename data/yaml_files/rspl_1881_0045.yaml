revised_title: The States of Matter and Surface Tension
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- Thermodynamics
- Surface Tension
- Phase Transitions
- Fluid Dynamics
- Capillarity
tldr: The author discusses the states of matter and the importance of a free surface
  to determine the state of a substance. They explain the differences between solid,
  liquid, and gaseous states and how surface tension, capillarity, and cohesion are
  related to these states. The author also investigates the effect of gases on liquids
  and the role of temperature and pressure in phase transitions.
