tldr: This study investigates the influence of strain on the orientation of cellulose
  microfibrils in sisal leaf fibers. The researchers found that the orientation of
  these microfibrils changes with the applied strain, which affects the mechanical
  properties of the fibers. This understanding can be useful for improving the use
  of vegetable fibers in various industries.
