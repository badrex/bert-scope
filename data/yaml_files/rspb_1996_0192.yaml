tldr: This study investigates the temporal patterns of clonality and parasitism in
  a population of freshwater bryozoans, Cristatella mucedo, and the associated prevalence
  of a myxozoan parasite, Tetracapsula bryozoides. The researchers found that high
  levels of clonality and parasitism persisted over a three-year period, with four
  distinct clones identified using random amplified polymorphic DNA markers. The most
  common clone in the first year became less common by the third year, while the prevalence
  of the myxozoan parasite varied through time. These findings contribute to understanding
  the ecology of asexuality and how highly clonal organisms may persist in the face
  of natural enemies.
