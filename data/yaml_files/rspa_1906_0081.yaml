tldr: This article investigates the optical properties of thin metallic plates, focusing
  on the reflection and transmission of light through these plates. The authors derive
  convenient formulae for the ellipticity and phase difference of the reflected and
  transmitted light and compare them with recent experimental results. The study reveals
  the significant impact of plate thickness on the optical properties and the influence
  of the surrounding medium on the reflected light.
