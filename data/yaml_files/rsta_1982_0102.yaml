tldr: This article reviews the current status of measurements of the cosmic microwave
  background (CMB) spectrum and discusses the challenges faced by experimenters. The
  experimental spectrum is found to be approximately that of a 3 K black body, with
  a peak at 180 GHz. The article highlights the difficulties in accurately measuring
  the spectrum, including unwanted signals from the apparatus and the sky, and the
  need for high-frequency measurements to be done from higher sites like aircraft,
  balloons, rockets, or satellites. The importance of atmospheric corrections and
  the potential of space satellites for future high-frequency measurements is also
  discussed.
