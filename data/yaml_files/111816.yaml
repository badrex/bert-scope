tldr: The author critiques Rev. H. Moseley's explanation of glacier motion, arguing
  that Moseley's theory based on thermal expansion and contraction is flawed. Forbes
  emphasizes the plasticity of glaciers and the importance of gravity as a moving
  force. He also disputes the effectiveness of temperature changes on the massive
  ice structures, stating that the expansion of ice by heat and cold is impossible
  due to its freezing point.
