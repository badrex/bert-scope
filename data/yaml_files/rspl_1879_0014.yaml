tldr: Dr. Benjamin Ward Richardson invents the sphygmophone, a device that converts
  pulse movements into audible sounds through a telephone. The sphygmophone consists
  of a sphygmograph connected to a microphone and a battery, producing distinct sounds
  corresponding to the systolic push, arterial recoil, and valvular check of the pulse.
  This invention aids in teaching and illustrating pulse movements to students and
  medical professionals.
