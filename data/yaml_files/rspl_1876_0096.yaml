tldr: The author discusses experiments conducted by Louis Pasteur that disprove the
  theory of spontaneous generation. Pasteur tested Dr. Bastian's views using simple
  but effective apparatus and found no evidence supporting the doctrine. The author
  also mentions meteorological observations made in New South Wales during 1873 and
  1874 under the direction of H. C. Russell.
