tldr: The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, conducted experiments to understand how sap
  ascends in trees and how leaves receive their nourishment. He discovered that the
  sap descends from the young branches and leaves through the bark and found that
  leaves receive nourishment through central vessels, which are surrounded by other
  tubes. The author also discussed the role of the medulla as a reservoir of moisture
  and the heartwood as a support structure for trees.
