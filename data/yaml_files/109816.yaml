tldr: The author explains a method for producing a double distillation process using
  the same heat. By controlling the temperature and pressure, the process can be optimized
  to achieve better results. The method involves using a specially designed apparatus
  with a head and receiver to ensure air-tightness and efficient heat transfer.
