tldr: The authors explore the genetic and functional aspects of primate brain evolution,
  focusing on the role of genomic imprinting and the contribution of maternal and
  paternal genomes to brain development. They discuss the expansion of the neocortex
  and striatum, which are linked to social and cognitive skills, and the contraction
  of the hypothalamus and septum, which are related to primary motivated behavior.
  The study highlights the importance of understanding the genetic mechanisms behind
  brain evolution and their implications for primate social and ecological variables.
