tldr: The article discusses the identification and manipulation of plant genes involved
  in fruit ripening, specifically in tomatoes. By using antisense and partial sense
  gene techniques, researchers have created genetically modified tomato plants with
  improved ripening characteristics, such as better color, texture, storage life,
  and processing qualities. This research has led to the development of a new business
  division focused on improving fruit and vegetable varieties.
