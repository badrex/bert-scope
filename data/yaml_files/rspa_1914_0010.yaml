tldr: The authors investigate the composition and formation of Egyptian blue pigment,
  confirming Fouqu√©'s description of it as a crystalline silicate of copper. They
  also reveal that Dr. Russell successfully reproduced the pigment by repeatedly heating
  a mixture of quartz, copper carbonate, calcium carbonate, and fusion mixture, but
  not without calcium carbonate. The exact conditions for its formation remain uncertain.
