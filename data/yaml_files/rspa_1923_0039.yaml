tldr: This article explores the motion of electrons in gases and introduces the concept
  of the persistence factor. The author, H. A. Wilson, investigates how the persistence
  factor affects the velocity of electrons and how it varies with the energy of the
  electrons in nitrogen and hydrogen. The study suggests that the persistence factor
  can be as small as one-half and provides a general explanation for the variation
  of the apparent mean free path of electrons in gases.
