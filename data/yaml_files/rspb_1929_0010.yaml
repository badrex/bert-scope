tldr: The study investigates the nature of postural reflexes, particularly the stretch
  reflex, which is crucial for maintaining upright posture. The research shows that
  the stretch reflex is an extensor reflex that is resistant to fatigue. The authors
  analyze the muscle's response to stretch and release, discovering that it behaves
  as an inelastic body initially and then as an elastic body. They conclude that the
  "stationary rigidity" is a property of the muscle fiber and is not affected by sympathetic
  or dorsal root connections.
