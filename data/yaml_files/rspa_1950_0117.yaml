tldr: This article investigates the electrical resistivity of beryllium, magnesium,
  calcium, strontium, and barium at low temperatures. It discusses the experimental
  methods, results, and the behavior of these alkaline earth metals. The study also
  examines the effect of magnetic fields on the resistance of magnesium and the phenomenon
  of resistance increase at very low temperatures.
