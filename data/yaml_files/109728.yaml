tldr: The author, James Macartney, observed a unique structure in the small intestines
  of birds called the caecum. This structure is larger in some bird species and has
  a distinct function. It is connected to the yolk-bag and retains evidence of its
  origin from the fetal life of the bird. This caecum plays a role in the bird's digestive
  system and is an interesting example of an organ retained from fetal life for a
  specific function.
