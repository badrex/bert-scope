tldr: The author investigates the possibility of a frozen evolutionary optimum in
  the genetic alphabet, specifically the use of four letters in DNA. They discuss
  the chemical feasibility of introducing new base pairs into the genetic alphabet
  and analyze the factors that contribute to the fitness of ribo-organisms, such as
  replication fidelity and overall metabolic rate. The author concludes that a four-letter
  alphabet is the optimal choice for ribo-organisms, considering a wide range of parameter
  values.
