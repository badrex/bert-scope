tldr: The author analyzes petrological aspects of Imbrium stratigraphy using samples
  from Fra Mauro and the Apennine Front. They find that most clasts in the breccias
  show fragmental textures, indicating a fragmented pre-Imbrium crust. The study provides
  insights into the depth of excavation of major lunar basins and the composition
  of the lunar crust.
