tldr: The author, Baden Powell, investigates the dispersion of light using various
  methods, including the work of M. Cauchy and Mr. Kelland. He compares the results
  of these methods with experimental data and finds that Mr. Kelland's method provides
  a more accurate representation of the refractive indices. The author also discusses
  the limitations of current theories and the need for further advancements in understanding
  light dispersion.
