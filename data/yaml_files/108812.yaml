tldr: The author investigates the rigidity of the Earth and its effect on tidal phenomena.
  They conclude that the Earth's rigidity is greater than that of steel, and that
  the actual tidal influence is less than what would be expected if the Earth were
  perfectly rigid. The author also discusses the comparison between different tidal
  theories and their applications in understanding the Earth's rigidity and tidal
  phenomena.
