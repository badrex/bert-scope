tldr: The ornithodolite is an instrument designed to collect large samples of bird
  speed measurements. It uses a rangefinder mounted on an alt-azimuth mount and digital
  photoelectric angular encoders to measure azimuth, elevation, and range. The data
  is stored in a microcomputer and later analyzed to estimate bird speeds. This instrument
  is useful for observing bird flight speeds in the wild, especially for albatrosses
  and petrels.
