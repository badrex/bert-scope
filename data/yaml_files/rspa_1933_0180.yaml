tldr: This article discusses the energy exchange between inert gas atoms and a solid
  surface, focusing on the thermal accommodation coefficient. The authors explain
  how the mean energy of gas atoms changes after collision with a solid surface and
  introduce a method to calculate the average accommodation coefficient over the normal
  modes of the solid.
