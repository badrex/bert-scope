tldr: The article discusses the role of mismatch repair in maintaining genetic stability
  and preventing tumor development. The authors describe the mechanism of methyl-directed
  mismatch excision repair in bacteria and its homologous system in human cells. They
  also explain how defects in the mismatch repair system can lead to increased mutability
  and a predisposition to tumor development in certain tissues.
