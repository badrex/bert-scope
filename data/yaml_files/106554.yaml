tldr: This article outlines the procedures and penalties for ejecting fellows from
  the Royal Society who disobey its statutes, defame the society, or cause damage
  to it. The President proposes the ejection, and if two-thirds of the members vote
  in favor, the fellow is removed from the society and their name is recorded in the
  journal-book.
