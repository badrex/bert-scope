tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the visual and auditory systems to understand
  the tracts by which sensory impressions reach the brain's cortex. They studied the
  effects of lesions on the brain and observed the resulting degenerations. The research
  aimed to clarify the cortical areas associated with different senses and the connections
  between the brain and sensory organs.
