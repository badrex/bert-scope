tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the changes in charge of alpha-particles
  passing through matter. They discovered a new phenomenon, the middle band, which
  appeared between the deflected and undeflected bands of alpha-particles. The intensity
  and position of the middle band changed as the alpha-particles' emergent range decreased,
  providing insights into the behavior of alpha-particles and their interactions with
  matter.
