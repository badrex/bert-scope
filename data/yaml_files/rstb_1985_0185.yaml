tldr: The article describes a cell marking technique based on the structural differences
  between chick and Japanese quail cells, allowing researchers to study cell lineage
  and cell migrations during avian development. The quail-chick marker system has
  been used to create chimeric tissues and embryos, providing valuable insights into
  cell differentiation and ontogeny.
