tldr: The author discusses the role of benzoquinones, specifically plastoquinone,
  in the electron transport system during photosynthesis. They found that plastoquinone
  is involved in the process and is essential for the reduction of ferricyanide and
  benzoquinones by chloroplasts. The author also discovered that the redox potential
  of benzoquinones determines their activity in promoting the electron transport chain.
