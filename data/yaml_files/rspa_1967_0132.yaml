tldr: The authors analyze the reflection of a plane shockwave from a heat-conducting
  wall using the method of matched asymptotic expansions. They consider the gas motion
  as one-dimensional and unsteady, and the solid material as having constant thermal
  properties. The study aims to explain the observed effects of temperature, pressure,
  and gas velocity after the shockwave reflection, and to provide a better understanding
  of the underlying physics of the problem.
