tldr: The authors analyze the concept of fluctuating asymmetry in ornaments and find
  issues with the methods and interpretations used in previous studies. They demonstrate
  that there are multiple ways to present data on trait asymmetry, making it difficult
  to establish a clear null hypothesis. Additionally, they argue that the fluctuating
  asymmetry theory may not adequately explain the honesty of ornamentation, as it
  cannot necessarily be applied to traits composed of more than one unit.
