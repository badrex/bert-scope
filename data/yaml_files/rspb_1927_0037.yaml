tldr: The study investigates the effects of X-ray sterilisation on the oestrous cycle
  and the role of persistent corpora lutea in the reproductive cycle of female mice.
  The research shows that X-ray sterilisation during pregnancy causes premature regression
  of the corpora lutea, while sterilisation during lactation leads to the permanent
  survival of corpora lutea. The findings suggest that neither follicles nor corpora
  lutea are essential for the maintenance of the oestrous cycle in unmated animals.
