tldr: The author describes the teeth of a large extinct marsupial genus, Sceparnodon
  Ramsay, which is similar to the existing monotrematous genus Echidna. The discovery
  of this fossil provides insight into the largest Monotreme found to date. The author
  also discusses the humerus of a fossil from Wellington Valley, which closely resembles
  the Echidna hystrix.
