tldr: This study investigates the effects of an oxygen-rich atmosphere on the respiratory
  exchange and metabolism in mice. The researchers found that when mice were placed
  in a pure oxygen environment, the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled per minute and
  per kilogram of body weight decreased significantly compared to when they were in
  regular air. This suggests that an oxygen-rich environment may affect the body's
  metabolism and gas exchange processes.
