tldr: This article discusses spectroscopic studies of the solar corona at X-ray wavelengths,
  focusing on the spatial distribution of emission in several X-ray lines. The authors
  present new results for the trio of helium-like lines, demonstrating a spatial variation
  in the density-dependent forbidden to intersystem line ratio and a strong spatial
  variation in the intensity of the resonance line relative to the optically forbidden
  transitions. The latter effect is believed to be caused by resonance scattering
  by material in the line of sight.
