tldr: This article investigates the structure and motion of free vertical shear layers
  in a rotating fluid, focusing on the dynamics of a slowly rising body. The authors
  explore three cases of axially bounded motion, including the split disk, rising
  disk, and rising sphere. They introduce an hypothesis to limit the strength of singularities
  in the layer solutions and discuss the implications of this hypothesis on the structure
  of the Stewartson layers.
