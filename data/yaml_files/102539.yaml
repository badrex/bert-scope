tldr: In this letter, Dr. John Wallis discusses the effects of music in ancient times,
  comparing them to the music of later ages. He explains that music in ancient times
  had a greater influence on people's emotions and behaviors due to its simplicity
  and the inclusion of poetry and dancing. Wallis also notes that the design of music
  has evolved over time, with modern music primarily focusing on pleasing the ear
  rather than eliciting specific emotions or behaviors.
