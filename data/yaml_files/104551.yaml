tldr: A father reports an unexpected experiment where his son, who suffers from sudden
  fits, was electrified and caused his fustian frock to catch fire. The father, Robert
  Roche, shares this observation with the Royal Society, expressing his surprise as
  previous literature stated only substances emitting inflammable vapors could catch
  fire due to electricity. This account raises questions about the understanding of
  electricity and its effects on different materials.
