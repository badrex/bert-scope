tldr: This article discusses the dissipation of tidal energy in the oceans and its
  consequences on the lunar orbit and Earth's rotation. The most precise method to
  estimate tidal dissipation is by evaluating the rate at which work is done on the
  ocean surface. The results from astronomical, satellite, and tidal estimates of
  dissipation allow for a separation of energy sinks in the solid Earth, the Moon,
  and the oceans. The study of tidal dissipation is important for understanding the
  origin and evolution of the Moon and other planetary satellite systems.
