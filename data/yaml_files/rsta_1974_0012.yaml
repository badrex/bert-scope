tldr: This article explores the use of ancient astronomical observations to study
  the non-gravitational accelerations of the Earth and Moon. It discusses the importance
  of astronomical chronology and its limitations, such as the lack of veracity in
  many records, errors in dating events, and uncertainty in calculating the circumstances
  of ancient eclipses of the Sun. The author reviews recent developments in this study
  and emphasizes the need for accurate and reliable data to establish a connection
  between ancient and modern calendars.
