tldr: Alexander Logie Du Toit was a prominent South African geologist and earth scientist
  who made significant contributions to the understanding of Earth's geological history
  and processes. He conducted extensive fieldwork, mapped various geological formations,
  and studied underground water resources. Du Toit also supported the theory of continental
  drift, which proposed that the Earth's continents were once part of a larger landmass
  that broke apart and drifted to their current positions.
