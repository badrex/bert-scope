tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the factors that determine the
  phagocytosis of red blood-cells. They discovered that phagocytosis can occur even
  without the presence of agglutinin and amboceptor. A special substance in the serum,
  which can be withdrawn from the serum by red blood-cells, is responsible for this
  process. This substance is not the same as agglutinin or amboceptor and can be found
  in the serum of animals that have received injections of red blood-cells.
