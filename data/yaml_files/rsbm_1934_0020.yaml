tldr: Walter Rosenhain was an Australian-born metallurgist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of metal deformation, crystallography, and the development
  of optical glass and alloys. His work on slip bands and the plastic deformation
  of metals laid the foundation for future research in the field. Rosenhain also played
  a crucial role in establishing the Department of Metallurgy and Metallurgical Chemistry
  at the National Physical Laboratory, where he led important research projects and
  developed new alloys and materials.
