tldr: The author presents a new method to analyze and interpret the theorems of dynamics
  using higher algebra and statics. They introduce the concept of complete differential
  coefficients and complete differences of lines, which can be applied to various
  magnitudes such as forces, velocities, and accelerations. The author demonstrates
  the application of these concepts to the kinematics of a particle, showing how to
  calculate velocity and acceleration using differential coefficients.
