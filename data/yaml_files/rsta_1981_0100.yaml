tldr: This article presents an in-depth study of Mathieu functions of general order,
  focusing on connection formulas, base functions, and asymptotic formulae. The Liouville-Green
  method and its extensions are discussed, providing approximate solutions to linear
  second-order differential equations with error estimates. The article also covers
  various applications and extensions of Mathieu functions in mathematical physics
  and applied mathematics.
