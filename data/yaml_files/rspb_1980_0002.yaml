tldr: The authors, Sir Cyril Clarke and E. B. Ford, reassess the intersexuality in
  the moth Lymantria dispar, focusing on the work of R. Goldschmidt. They find discrepancies
  between Goldschmidt's results and their own, and discuss the potential for testing
  the accuracy of the Goldschmidt hypothesis using the heterochromatin body in the
  larva as a marker for chromosomal sex in the adult.
