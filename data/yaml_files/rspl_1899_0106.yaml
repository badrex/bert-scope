tldr: This article explores the relationship between homogamy (marriage between similar
  individuals) and fertility, and how it affects evolution. The author argues that
  while reproductive selection can cause progressive changes in a species, it cannot
  differentiate a species into sub-groups without the influence of natural selection.
  The author also discusses the impact of homogamy and fertility on assortative mating,
  heredity, and the overall evolution of a species.
