tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the value of the Earth's magnetic
  field using a Helmholtz coil. They aimed for a measurement accurate to 1 or 2 parts
  in 10,000 and used a combination of a silver voltameter, resistance coil, and standard
  cell to measure the current. The results provided a direct comparison between the
  value of the magnetic field from absolute magnetic measurements and the value of
  the field produced by a known current.
