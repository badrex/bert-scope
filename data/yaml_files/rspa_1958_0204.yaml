tldr: The authors studied the thermodynamic properties and infra-red spectra of water
  molecules sorbed in zeolites. They found that the apparent heat capacity of intra-crystalline
  water is higher than that of liquid water, and the heat of sorption is approximately
  14 to 15 kcal mole-1. The infra-red absorption spectrum of the system revealed that
  each sorbed water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the aluminosilicate through both
  hydrogen atoms. The clustering of water molecules, presumably by mutual hydrogen
  bonding, causes the broadening of the absorption band, which becomes similar to
  that in liquid water when each cage is filled with a cluster of 21 water molecules.
