tldr: A seismic survey in the Red Sea reveals that much more than just the central
  trough is underlain by material with a seismic velocity characteristic of oceans.
  The study finds evidence for evaporites and suggests that the Red Sea crust could
  be oceanic in character over most of its width. This supports the idea of sea floor
  spreading on a substantial scale in the Miocene, with implications for neighboring
  features.
