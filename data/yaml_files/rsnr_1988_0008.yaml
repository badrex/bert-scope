tldr: This article explores the impact of Newton's Principia on British physics, particularly
  in the 19th century. It discusses the evolution of mathematical physics from geometrical
  to analytical methods and how British physicists, such as William Thomson and James
  Clerk Maxwell, perceived and built upon Newton's ideas. The article highlights the
  importance of Newton's laws of motion and the concept of energy in shaping the scientific
  landscape of the time.
