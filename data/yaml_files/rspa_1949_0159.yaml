tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the change of electrical resistivity in
  superconductors when transitioning between the superconductive and normal state
  in a longitudinal magnetic field. They found that the resistance transition is continuous,
  contrary to the accepted belief of a discontinuous transition. The results also
  showed a relationship between the geometrical form of the conductor and hysteresis
  phenomena.
