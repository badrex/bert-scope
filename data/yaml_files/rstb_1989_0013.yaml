tldr: The article describes an automated procedure for measuring the rate of leaf
  photosynthesis as a function of photon flux density (PFD). The method uses a leaf-disc
  electrode, an array of light-emitting diodes, and a computer to determine the rate
  of photosynthesis within 30 minutes. The procedure is applied to shade and sun plants,
  studies of photoinhibition, and analysis of the Kok effect. The results show differences
  in photosynthetic rates and light compensation points between sun and shade leaves,
  as well as variations in nominal light utilization capacity.
