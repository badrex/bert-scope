tldr: This article presents a new computational method for predicting the propagation
  of laminar flames in hydrogen-bromine mixtures. The method employs a coordinate
  system that moves with the flame, leading to invariant profiles of concentration
  and temperature. The authors apply this procedure to hydrogen-bromine flames, comparing
  their results with experimental data and previous theoretical predictions. The new
  method offers advantages in terms of computational time and storage, making it a
  valuable tool for understanding and predicting flame behavior.
