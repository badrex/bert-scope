tldr: This article investigates the intensities of vibration bands in carbonyl sulphide
  and acetylene. The authors study the effect of pressure on the absorption intensity
  and calculate the dipole moment of these molecules during molecular vibration. They
  also discuss the empirical relationships between absorption intensity and total
  pressure of gas. The results provide insights into the polar properties of chemical
  bonds in different molecules.
