tldr: This article investigates the relationship between area TEO and the V4 complex
  in the monkey visual cortex. The author argues that the posterior part of area TEO
  is part of the V4 complex, based on anatomical and functional evidence. The study
  also discusses the topographical organization of these areas and their callosal
  connections.
