tldr: This article investigates the creep behavior of sphere-cylinder shell intersections
  subjected to internal pressure, focusing on the deformation and rupture behavior.
  The study aims to develop a rational and simple design procedure for high-temperature
  components, considering factors like stress concentration, strain limitation, and
  material deterioration. The findings can be applied to the design of various pressure
  vessel components operating in the creep range.
