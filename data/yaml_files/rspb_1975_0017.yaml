tldr: The author analyzes 35 populations of the flowering plant Pemphis acidula and
  discovers that the heterostylic incompatibility system in these plants is under
  disruptive selection. This selection maintains an intermediate equilibrium between
  the long- and short-styled plants, preventing the complete adjustment to distyly.
  The study provides insights into the evolution of heterostyly and the role of disruptive
  selection in maintaining the balance between different plant types.
