tldr: The authors conducted a photoelectron spectroscopic study on the effects of
  ion-bombardment on single-crystal carbon surfaces, specifically diamond and graphite.
  They monitored changes in the X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (X.p.s.) of graphite
  as a function of exposure to argon and 57Fe ions. The study revealed that ion bombardment
  produces partially disordered but structurally distinct surface phases on graphite
  and diamond crystals. The bombarded surfaces were rather unreactive to oxygen, taking
  up only a small fraction of a monolayer.
