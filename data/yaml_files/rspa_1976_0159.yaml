tldr: The authors propose a new set of two-variable approximants that are covariant
  under rotations in the plane of the variables. They show that the previously proposed
  choices of weighting factors, SC1NCH and PETCH, are identical for these new approximants.
  The approximants derived from the series in these new variables possess desirable
  covariance properties and can be used to represent functions of two variables more
  effectively.
