tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the influence of the central
  nervous system on the cardiac rhythm and the effects of chloroform on that rhythm.
  They found that chloroform has a direct impact on the heart's intrinsic rhythm and
  that the reduction in pulse rate during chloroform anesthesia is partly due to the
  action of chloroform on the heart itself and partly due to the controlling influence
  of the vagus center in the medulla.
