tldr: The authors propose a method to determine the size of the Earth's core from
  observations of the geomagnetic secular variation. They apply this method to the
  best available geomagnetic data and compare the resulting "magnetic" radius with
  the "seismological" value. This method has potential for use on other planets once
  accurate magnetic measurements become available.
