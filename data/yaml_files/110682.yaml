tldr: Sir Charles Bell's paper discusses the respiratory system of nerves, which he
  considers both muscular and sensitive. He describes the tract of the spinal cord
  and its columns, with no decussations. Bell confirms through experiments that the
  phrenic and spinal accessory nerves are responsible for motion, and he explains
  the supply of blood to the respiratory system of nerves, which helps explain several
  pathological phenomena.
