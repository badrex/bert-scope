tldr: The authors investigated the term structure of the second spark spectrum of
  thallium (Tl III) and identified the real F and G first members, as well as members
  of each of the S, P, and D series. They also examined the Hg II spectrum and made
  progress in understanding its structure. The study provides insights into the atomic
  structure and ionization of thallium.
