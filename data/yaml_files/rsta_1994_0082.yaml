tldr: This article presents a lattice model for liquid crystalline microstructure
  in thermotropic polymers. The model provides a three-dimensional solution to the
  Frank elasticity equations and represents the development of texture as the microstructure
  relaxes over time. It also simulates disclination motion and their interactions,
  offering insights into the organization of disclination loops and the influence
  of splay constants on microstructure.
