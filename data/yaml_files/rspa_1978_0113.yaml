tldr: The article presents a spin Hamiltonian for electron spin resonance of radicals
  in doublet states using the energy weighted maximum overlap model. The model provides
  reliable estimates of the parameters in the spin Hamiltonian, aiding in identifying
  radicals, their geometry, and electronic structure. The study focuses on radicals
  with one unpaired electron in a non-degenerate state and considers interactions
  such as the g-tensor, hyperfine interaction tensor, and quadrupole interaction tensor.
