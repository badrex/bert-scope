tldr: The author discovered that an electric current passing through a conducting
  wire, such as an iron wire, causes a permanent molecular twist in the wire. This
  twist can be measured using an electromagnetic induction balance and is not visible
  or detectable by touch. The phenomenon occurs in both iron and steel wires and can
  be reversed by changing the direction of the electric current. The author also found
  that a strong permanent magnet can instantly reduce the twist caused by the electric
  current.
