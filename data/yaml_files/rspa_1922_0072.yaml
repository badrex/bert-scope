tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the energy loss of alpha particles
  as they pass through matter. They used a modified Boys' radio-micrometer to measure
  the heating effect produced by the alpha particles after traveling a specific distance.
  The results provided insights into the mechanism of energy transfer between alpha
  particles and surrounding atoms, contributing to the understanding of nuclear physics.
