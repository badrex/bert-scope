tldr: John Tyndall's experiments reveal that the main absorbent constituent of the
  atmosphere's calorific rays is aqueous vapour, which has important implications
  for meteorology and climate science. He demonstrates that the absorption of heat
  by aqueous vapour is significantly higher than that of dry air, and that other factors,
  such as suspended carbon particles, have a minimal impact on this absorption.
