tldr: A woman had a child in her abdomen for over 16 years, alongside having four
  other children. The child was eventually removed after the woman's death, revealing
  a rare case of extra-uterine pregnancy. This case study highlights the complexity
  of such conditions and challenges the belief that boys are conceived on the right
  side and girls on the left.
