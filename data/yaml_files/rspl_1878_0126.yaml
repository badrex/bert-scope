tldr: The authors conducted a series of experiments on lactin, or sugar of milk, to
  study its optical properties and chemical composition. They determined the constant
  of Jellett's polarimeter and found the specific rotation of lactin to be 59.17.
  The authors also examined the change in rotatory power over time and the effect
  of temperature and salts on lactin solutions. They discovered a break in the change
  of rotatory power, which may be related to lactin's dual nature, producing lactose
  and galactose.
