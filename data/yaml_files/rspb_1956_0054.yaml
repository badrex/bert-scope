tldr: The study investigates the effects of cooling and rewarming golden hamsters
  to body temperatures below 0Â°C. It examines the biophysical aspects and discusses
  the factors that may limit the viability of animals during chilling, freezing, and
  thawing. The research explores the proportion of body water converted to ice and
  its impact on the survival of hamsters. The findings contribute to understanding
  the possibility of storing whole animals for long periods in suspended animation
  in the frozen state.
