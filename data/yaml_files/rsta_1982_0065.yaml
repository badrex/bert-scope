tldr: This article discusses the chemical aspects of the Earth's core formation, focusing
  on the isotopic composition of the core and mantle. The authors use lead isotopes
  in mantle materials to study the core's formation and evolution. They also explore
  the chemical context of the core's growth and the distribution of iron throughout
  geological time.
