tldr: This article discusses the investigation of the Moon's surface and planetary
  material properties using thermal radiation. The author explains the physical principles
  and methods for studying these properties, focusing on the measurement of thermal
  radiation flux and effective temperature. The study helps determine the dielectric
  constant, density, and other properties of planetary materials, as well as understanding
  the variable thermal regime and surface temperature fluctuations.
