tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the action of certain metals and substances
  on photographic plates. They discovered that metals like uranium, zinc, cadmium,
  and magnesium can cause a change on the plates even in complete darkness. The author
  also found that the action can pass through various materials like gelatine, celluloid,
  and parchment, and that different papers have varying levels of transparency to
  this action.
