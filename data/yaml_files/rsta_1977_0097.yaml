tldr: The article discusses the impact of solar wind on the Moon, specifically the
  induction of magnetic fields in the lunar interior. The authors analyze the transfer
  functions and bulk electrical conductivity profile of the Moon, providing insights
  into the Moon's formation and evolution. They also compare the conductivity models
  with those of Earth and discuss the implications for lunar temperature estimates.
