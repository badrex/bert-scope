tldr: The author, William Hyde Wollaston, discusses his observations on the quantity
  of horizontal refraction and presents a method for measuring the dip at sea. He
  explains that variations in the dip of the apparent horizon, which affect all observations
  of altitude at sea, can be influenced by this variable refraction. Wollaston also
  suggests a way to correct the error in nautical observations caused by assuming
  the horizon is always at the observer's height.
