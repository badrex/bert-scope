tldr: The authors conducted experiments on rats to study the effects of progesterone
  and testosterone on the corpora lutea and endometrium. They found that the administration
  of these hormones led to the formation of functional corpora lutea and changes in
  the endometrium, suggesting that these hormones can influence the reproductive system
  in female rats.
