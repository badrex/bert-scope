tldr: This article discusses the methods used in the United Kingdom to predict the
  airborne spread of foot-and-mouth disease and Newcastle disease. It describes the
  importance of controlling these diseases and the potential routes of transmission.
  The article also explains the process of predicting airborne transmission, focusing
  on factors such as the quantity of virus released, virus survival, and the ability
  to cause infection. The methods currently used for predicting airborne transmission
  of these diseases are discussed, along with the challenges and limitations.
