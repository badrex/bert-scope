tldr: This article discusses the challenges and advancements in measuring temperature
  and determining melting points in the laser-heated diamond-anvil cell. The authors
  focus on the development of simultaneous high-pressure and temperature measurements
  and review practical aspects of the technique. They present results for the melting
  of argon and iron and the relative positions of their melting curves.
