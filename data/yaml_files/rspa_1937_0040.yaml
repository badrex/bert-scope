tldr: The authors conducted experiments to analyze the spectrum of ionized tellurium
  (Te III) and identified new terms and multiplets in the atomic spectrum. They observed
  interesting deviations from the expected characteristics of ionized atoms and provided
  a more comprehensive understanding of the atomic structure of tellurium.
