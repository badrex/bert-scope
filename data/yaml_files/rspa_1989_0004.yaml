tldr: This article explores the relationship between the fractal dimension of surfaces
  in turbulent flows and the processes of mixing and entrainment. The authors demonstrate
  that the fractal dimension of these surfaces can be used to predict the amount of
  mixing between two reactants in a turbulent flow, and they provide experimental
  evidence to support their predictions. The findings have implications for understanding
  and modeling mixing and entrainment in a variety of turbulent flows.
