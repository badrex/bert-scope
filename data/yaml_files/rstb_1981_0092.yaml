tldr: This article discusses the importance of selenium in animal and human nutrition
  and health. Selenium is an essential trace element that plays a crucial role in
  the enzyme glutathione peroxidase, which helps control intracellular levels of hydrogen
  peroxide and protect cells from damage caused by oxygen metabolites. Selenium deficiency
  can lead to metabolic and physiological consequences, such as cardiomyopathy known
  as Keshan disease. The article highlights the interaction between selenium, other
  nutrients, and trace elements, emphasizing the importance of maintaining adequate
  selenium levels for overall health.
