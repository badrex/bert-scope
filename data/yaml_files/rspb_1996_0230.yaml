tldr: The authors examined the relationship between species richness and higher-taxon
  richness in locally dispersed forest reserves in Sri Lanka. They found that family
  and genus richness were closely linked to species richness, independently of site
  size. Using higher-taxon data, such as genera and families, instead of species for
  surveying and ranking conservation sites can reduce costs by 60-85% while maintaining
  the representation of species in priority sites. This study confirms the higher-taxon
  approach as a valuable technique for local conservation planning in the tropics.
