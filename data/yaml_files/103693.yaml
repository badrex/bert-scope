tldr: The author critiques Mr. de Lisle's method of comparing the magnitudes of Paris
  and London, pointing out that de Lisle's assumption about the relationship between
  longitude and latitude is incorrect. The author provides a corrected comparison,
  stating that London is one fourteenth greater than Paris.
