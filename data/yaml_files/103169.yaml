tldr: This letter describes a case study of a young man with large kidney stones who
  passed some through his urethra and others that required surgical intervention.
  The author, Ralph Thoresby, discusses the size and weight of the stones, as well
  as the surgical process used to remove them. He also notes the condition of the
  bladder and ureters after the stones were removed.
