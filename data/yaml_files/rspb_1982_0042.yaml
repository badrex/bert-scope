tldr: This study investigates how the distribution of sodium and potassium channels
  in mammalian myelinated nerves changes during regeneration and development in rabbit
  sciatic nerves. The research shows that the number of sodium channels increases
  in regenerating nerves, and potassium currents contribute to the action potential
  in both regenerating and developing nerves. The sensitivity to the potassium-blocking
  agent 4-aminopyridine decreases over time in these nerves.
