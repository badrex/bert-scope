tldr: The study investigates the eyes of anchovy fish, Anchoa mitchilli and A. hepsetus,
  focusing on the pigment epithelium and its relationship with photoreceptors. The
  research reveals unique features in the organization of the pigment epithelium,
  including the presence of guanine platelets that may function as a reflector. The
  findings provide insights into the diverse functions of the pigment epithelium in
  anchovy fish eyes.
