tldr: The author, W.H. Bragg, investigates how the constituents of a crystal affect
  the form of the spectrum in an X-ray spectrometer. He demonstrates that the absorption
  coefficient of a crystal depends on the atomic weight of the metal and the wave-length
  of the X-ray. The crystal's atomic structure influences the intensity and position
  of the X-ray spectrum, which can be used to study the structure of materials.
