tldr: This article discusses the molecular mechanisms of recombination and meiosis,
  focusing on the specificity of pairing between homologous chromosomes, the control
  of recombination initiation, and the factors governing interference between crossovers.
  The author also explores the role of DNA binding proteins and synaptonemal complexes
  in these processes.
