tldr: The study examines the growth changes in the myelin sheath of peripheral nerve
  fibers in fishes, specifically in Salmo trutta and Raia clavata. Contrary to earlier
  reports, the research found that the relative thickness of the myelin sheath decreases
  progressively during growth as the fiber size increases. The thickness of the myelin
  sheath for a given axon diameter is constant, irrespective of the size of the fish,
  for comparable sites in the nerve. The findings support previous observations in
  mammals and provide insights into the relationship between internodal length and
  fiber diameter during growth.
