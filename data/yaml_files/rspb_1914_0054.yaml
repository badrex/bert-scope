tldr: This article discusses corrections in a previous publication and summarizes
  research on the thymus gland in animals. It highlights the findings that castration
  causes a persistent growth and a retarded atrophy of the gland in rabbits and cattle.
  The reciprocal action of the thymus on the testis is also investigated in guinea
  pigs, showing that thymectomy leads to a more rapid growth of the testes in young
  animals.
