tldr: The authors investigate the surface ionisation of potassium by tungsten and
  its potential for creating a steady, intense, and long-lasting beam of positive
  ions. They study the process of ionisation, the build-up and breakdown of equilibrium,
  and the factors affecting ionisation efficiency. The experiments provide insights
  into the behaviour of fast K+ ions striking a hot target and the potential applications
  of this ion source in further research.
