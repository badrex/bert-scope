tldr: The authors isolated thyrocalcitonin, a polypeptide hormone from rat thyroid
  glands, and studied its effects in rats. They found that thyrocalcitonin lowers
  blood calcium and phosphate levels and remains effective under various conditions,
  such as parathyroidectomy, nephrectomy, and vitamin deficiencies. The hormone acts
  on bones and likely plays a significant role in normal physiology.
