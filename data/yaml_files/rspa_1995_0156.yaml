tldr: This article studies the macroscopic plastic response of composites with strain
  gradient effects. The authors develop a deformation theory of strain gradient plasticity,
  which assumes that the strain energy density depends on both the von Mises strain
  invariant and a curvature invariant. They derive bounds and estimates for the overall
  plastic response of statistically homogeneous and isotropic strain gradient composites
  using a nonlinear variational principle. The results demonstrate a size effect for
  the plastic response of two-phase composites.
