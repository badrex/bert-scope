tldr: The author investigates the light border phenomenon in photographs, which occurs
  when a dark object is photographed against the sky. They suggest that the phenomenon
  is caused by the interaction of light rays of different refrangibility, which affects
  the phosphorescence of the photographic plate. The author also explains how the
  proportion of rays of low to high refrangibility in different light sources can
  influence the phosphorescence and the light border phenomenon.
