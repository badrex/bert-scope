tldr: This study investigates the influence of chemical constitution on interfacial
  tension and surface energy. The author examines the behavior of various fluids and
  their molecular interactions, finding that interfacial tension is affected by factors
  such as chemical reactivity and molecular polarization. The results provide insights
  into the spreading of fluids and the development of contact differences in potential
  at interfaces.
