tldr: This article corrects an error in a previous publication about the reproduction
  modes of Pelagohydra mirabilis, a rare coelenterate. The author suggests that the
  organism may largely perpetuate itself through medusa-medusa reproduction and may
  eventually eliminate the hydroid stage from its life cycle. The author also discusses
  the possibility of sexual and asexual reproduction in medusae and the phenomenon
  of budding in different groups of medusae.
