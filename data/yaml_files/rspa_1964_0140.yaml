tldr: The authors developed a combined flash-photolysis and shock-tube technique to
  study fast photochemical reactions. This method combines the advantages of both
  techniques, allowing for precise temperature control and high-velocity gas flow.
  The technique was demonstrated using the decompositions of phosgene and oxalyl chloride,
  providing interesting insights into the reactions and their products.
