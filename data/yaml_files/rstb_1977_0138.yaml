tldr: This article discusses the possibilities for enhancing biological nitrogen fixation
  in agriculture, focusing on extending existing nitrogen-fixing systems, augmenting
  their effectiveness, and constructing new nitrogen-fixing systems. The author explores
  various long-term possibilities, such as using alder trees, blue-green algae, and
  grass associations, as well as genetic manipulation of plants and microbes to improve
  nitrogen fixation efficiency.
