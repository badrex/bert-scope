tldr: This study investigates the spatial characteristics of electric current and
  field in large direct-current coronas. The authors measured the current density
  and field distributions over rod-plane gaps up to 3 meters, constructing a general
  model of current flow with reasonable accuracy. They established the inter-relationship
  of the modification by space-charge of the original applied field and the current
  density for corona of both polarities. The findings contribute to understanding
  the behavior of corona currents in high-voltage systems.
