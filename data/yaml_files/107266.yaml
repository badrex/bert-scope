tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the cause of colored concentric
  rings and other prismatic appearances. They discovered that the shape and curvature
  of the surfaces in contact are responsible for the formation of these phenomena.
  The author also found that different surface curvatures produce various colored
  patterns, such as rings, streaks, and ellipses. This research helps to understand
  the underlying principles of prismatic appearances and the action of bodies and
  surfaces on light.
