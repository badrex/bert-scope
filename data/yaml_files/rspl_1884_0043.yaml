tldr: This paper investigates the variations in the mean diurnal inequality of the
  horizontal component of the Earth's magnetic force at Bombay, comparing them to
  the sun-spot period. The study reveals a nearly eleven-yearly periodical variation
  in the magnetic force, which precedes the sun-spot area curve by six months. The
  findings support Dr. Stewart's views on the relationship between magnetic variations
  and solar heat.
