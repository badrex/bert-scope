tldr: 'The authors studied the spontaneous activity of neurons in the cat''s cerebral
  cortex using chronically implanted microelectrodes. They found that trains of action
  potentials can be described using a -normal distribution, requiring only two parameters:
  modal interval and standard deviation. This description was applicable to neurons
  in various cortical areas and across different behavioral states of the animal.'
