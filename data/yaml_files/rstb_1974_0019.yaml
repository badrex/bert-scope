tldr: The article presents electron microscopic studies on intact nuclear 'ghosts'
  and nuclear membrane fragments using the technique of negative staining. The authors
  reveal molecular details within the nuclear pore complex, including the octagonal
  annulus, central granule, inner ring, and fibrillar material. They also discuss
  the preparation methods of nuclear membranes and the use of different negative stains
  for better interpretation of the electron optical images. This research contributes
  to understanding the structure and composition of biological membranes and nuclear
  pore complexes.
