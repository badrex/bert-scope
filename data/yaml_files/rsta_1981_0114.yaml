revised_title: 'Evolution of Earth''s Continental Crust: Granite Plutonism and Plate
  Tectonics'
scientific_discipline: Earth Sciences > Geology
semantic_tags:
- Continental crust formation

- Earth's crust evolution
tldr: This article discusses the origin and evolution of Earth's continental crust
  through the study of granite plutonism and its relationship with plate tectonics.
  It explores the space-time trends of granitoid rocks and how they reflect changes
  in tectonic patterns, magma types, and crust mobility. The article also highlights
  the importance of understanding the Earth's long-term thermal decay in explaining
  crustal evolution.
