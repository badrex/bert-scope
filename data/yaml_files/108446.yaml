tldr: The author conducted a study on the temperature of humans within the tropics,
  measuring the body temperature of an individual at different times of the day and
  under various conditions. The results showed that the body temperature was generally
  lower in the morning and higher at night, with fluctuations influenced by factors
  such as sleep, bed covering, and the quality of the surrounding atmosphere. The
  study also demonstrated how the body temperature responds to exercise and other
  physical activities, highlighting the importance of thermoregulation in maintaining
  health in tropical climates.
