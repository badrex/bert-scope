tldr: The authors demonstrate that the post-Newtonian equations of Einstein, Infeld,
  and Hoffmann are invariant to a specific post-Galilean transformation. This transformation
  allows for the consideration of a 'centre of mass system' in the context of post-Newtonian
  theory, expanding our understanding of the motion of mass points under gravitational
  attraction.
