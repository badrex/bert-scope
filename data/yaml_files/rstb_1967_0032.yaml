tldr: This study investigates the structure and function of the visceral nerves in
  octopuses, focusing on their connections to the gastric ganglion and other organs.
  The research reveals that the visceral nerves contain numerous fibers, form plexuses,
  and have nerve cells scattered near their end organs. These features are related
  to the autonomous actions of some of the viscera and may be connected to the control
  of the viscera from the central nervous system.
