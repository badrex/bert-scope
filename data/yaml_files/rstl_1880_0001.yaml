tldr: The authors describe an improved method for determining the rate of vibration
  of tuning forks using a rotating graduated drum and an electric clock. They detail
  the development of a pendulum-driven apparatus and discuss various challenges and
  solutions encountered during the process. This research contributes to the understanding
  of tuning fork vibrations and their potential applications in timekeeping and acoustics.
