tldr: This study investigates the effect of cross-linking on the density and melting
  of polythene. Cross-linking reduces the percentage of crystalline material at room
  temperature, but the melting temperature remains almost unchanged. The density change
  at the transition temperature is significantly lessened due to the reduced amount
  of crystalline material. The research also explores the transformation of polythene
  into a rubber-like or gel material upon cross-linking, which affects its density
  and melting properties.
