tldr: The author discusses the classification of stars, specifically Cephei and Cygni
  stars, based on their spectral characteristics. They argue that these stars have
  different physical properties and temperatures, and that their classification should
  be based on these factors rather than just their cooling or heating states. The
  author compares the spectra of various stars, including 8 Cephei, 7 Cygni, and a
  Persei, and provides evidence for their distinct classifications.
