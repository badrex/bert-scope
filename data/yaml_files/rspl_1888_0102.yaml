tldr: This study investigates the innervation of pulmonary vessels and the relationship
  between systemic and pulmonary blood pressures. The authors conducted experiments
  on dogs, stimulating spinal nerves and measuring blood pressure changes in the pulmonary
  and systemic vessels. They found that a significant rise in aortic pressure is needed
  to produce an appreciable rise in pulmonary pressure, and that this rise must be
  sustained for some time. The results suggest that the pulmonary vessels have a system
  of vaso-motor nerves, which play a role in regulating blood pressure.
