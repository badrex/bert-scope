tldr: This paper presents analytical and numerical solutions to two-dimensional moving
  interface problems in steel ingot solidification. The authors investigate certain
  analytical solutions that simulate aspects of ingot solidification, such as inward
  solidification of a liquid half-space with varying wall temperatures or Newton cooling
  at the wall. They also discuss other approximate analytical approaches and briefly
  mention a computer procedure for solving these problems. A two-dimensional mathematical
  model of ingot solidification is developed, and numerical solutions are given for
  ingots with varying mould surface geometry and composition. The results are in good
  agreement with radioisotope tracer tests performed at the British Steel Corporation.
