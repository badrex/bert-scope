tldr: The authors investigate the higher-order moments and cumulants of sums of random
  variables with long-range dependence. They use tensor methods to simplify calculations
  and study the limiting forms of second and third cumulants as the number of variables
  added becomes large. The implications of their findings are discussed for the existence
  of non-gaussian limits of sums of random quantities of finite variance and long-range
  dependence.
