tldr: This article investigates the pear-shaped figure of equilibrium of a rotating
  mass of liquid, focusing on the properties of the Jacobian ellipsoids. The author
  re-examines M. Poincar√©'s work on the subject and derives expressions for the coefficients
  of stability using ellipsoidal harmonic analysis. The critical Jacobian ellipsoid
  is found to have axes proportional to 0.65066, 0.81498, and 1.88583, and the author
  discusses the challenges of obtaining absolute proof of stability through higher
  approximations.
