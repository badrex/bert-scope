tldr: The author investigates the energetics of muscle relaxation and finds that most
  of the heat produced during relaxation comes from the dissipation of mechanical
  energy when the muscle ceases to bear the load. The study also shows that relaxation
  is primarily a passive process, with minimal involvement of chemical changes associated
  with muscular activity.
