tldr: The author presents an analytical solution for the transmission of electric
  waves over the Earth's surface, considering the effects of resistance and curvature.
  The study compares the results of the theory with recorded experiments, suggesting
  that the diffraction theory can explain the observed facts when considering daylight
  observations at great distances.
