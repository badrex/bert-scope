tldr: This article investigates the role of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) in arterial
  hemostasis. The authors found that infusing ADP-releasing enzymes or ADP-receptor
  antagonists into the blood significantly increased bleeding times in rats, suggesting
  that ADP plays a crucial role in the process of hemostasis by accelerating platelet
  aggregation.
