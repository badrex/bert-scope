tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the temperature of the
  head and its relation to mental activity. They examined the normal relative temperatures
  of different parts of the head and how they change during increased mental activity.
  The research aimed to provide data on the connection between brain function and
  temperature, which could help in understanding localized cerebral disorders.
