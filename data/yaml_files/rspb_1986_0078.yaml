tldr: This study presents a mathematical model for the spatial spread of rabies among
  foxes and explores potential control strategies. The model considers the erratic
  movement of rabid foxes as the main cause of the disease's spread and suggests that
  vaccination has considerable advantages over severe culling. The authors estimate
  that the disease would reach Manchester within about 3.5 years if introduced near
  Southampton, moving at speeds as high as 100 km per year in the central region.
