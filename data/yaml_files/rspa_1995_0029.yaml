tldr: The article presents a method for obtaining the elastic fields due to defects
  like inclusions, dislocations, disclinations, and point defects in transversely
  isotropic bimaterials. The bimaterial consists of two semi-infinite solids bonded
  together or in frictionless contact, and the elastic solution is expressed in terms
  of hexagonal stress vectors. Closed-form solutions for various defects are provided,
  including inclusions, straight dislocations, disclination lines, circular dislocation
  loops, and point defects.
