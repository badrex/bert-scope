tldr: The authors studied the recycling of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in liver
  cells using biochemical and immunocytochemical approaches. They found evidence for
  receptor recycling and localized the intracellular compartment where the asialoglycoprotein
  dissociates from its receptor. This research provides insights into receptor-mediated
  endocytosis and the role of the asialoglycoprotein receptor in liver cells.
