tldr: This article discusses the application of Regge calculus to quantum gravity
  and quantum field theory in a curved background. It develops a discrete form of
  exterior differential calculus and obtains Laplacians for -forms on the Regge manifold.
  The author assesses the accuracy of these approximations by calculating the eigenvalues
  of the discrete Laplacians for regular tessellations of and S^2. The results indicate
  that the methods obtained in this paper may be used in curved space-times with an
  accuracy comparable to that obtained in lattice gauge theories on a flat background.
