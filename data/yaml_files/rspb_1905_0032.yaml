tldr: The author investigates the transformation of rotifer eggs into ciliated infusoria,
  a process known as heterogenesis. By placing rotifer eggs in dark, stone pots, the
  author observes the development of ciliated infusoria from the egg's contents. This
  research provides evidence for heterogenesis and sheds light on the diverse forms
  of organisms that can arise from molecular composition and polarity.
