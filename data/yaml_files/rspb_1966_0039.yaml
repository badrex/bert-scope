tldr: The authors investigated the carbamate reaction of carbon dioxide with glycyl-glycine
  using a new electrode method. They found that the carbamate reaction is kinetically
  biphasic, with a rapid primary stage and a slow secondary stage. The results show
  that the carbamate compound of glycyl-glycine is a stronger acid than carbonic acid,
  and the ionization constant of the terminal groups of amino acid chains of proteins
  is within the same range as glycyl-glycine. This study provides a simple model for
  studying carbamate reactions in the more complex case of haemoglobin.
