tldr: This study investigates the effect of compressibility on the speed of propagation
  of a vortex ring in a calorically perfect gas. The research assumes the flow outside
  the vortex ring is irrotational and isentropic. The findings show that compressibility
  slows down the vortex ring, and the speed of propagation depends on the distribution
  of circulatory velocity and entropy within the core. The results extend the cut-off
  theory of filament motion to compressible fluids.
