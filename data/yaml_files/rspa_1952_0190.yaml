tldr: This article discusses the properties of liquids and their differences from
  solids, focusing on the theories of liquid state, viscosity, and the role of dislocations
  and grain boundaries in their behavior. The author compares various theories and
  their applications to rare gases and metals, highlighting the differences in interatomic
  forces and activation energies.
