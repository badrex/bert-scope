  Strain Cells

tldr: The authors conducted experiments on five types of cells grown in tissue culture
  to study the synthesis of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and nuclear protein in normal
  and tumor strain cells. They found that in normal cells, DNA and protein synthesis
  begin together, while in tumor cells, nuclear protein synthesis starts before DNA
  synthesis and appears to be a continuous process. This suggests that part of nuclear
  protein synthesis in tumor cells may be independent of normal genetic control.
