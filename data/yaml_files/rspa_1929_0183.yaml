tldr: This article describes the experimental procedure for determining the melting
  point of palladium and establishing an international temperature scale using black-body
  radiation and pyrometry. The authors employed three different methods to create
  black-body radiators and used a disappearing-filament pyrometer to measure the radiation
  intensities at the melting points of gold and palladium.
