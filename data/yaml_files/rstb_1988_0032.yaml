tldr: The article describes the anatomy and mode of life of nine species of archaeogastropod
  limpets from hydrothermal vents. These limpets have unique feeding methods and anatomical
  features, such as specialized rhipidoglossate radula and a single left gill with
  a pectiniform skeleton. The study provides insights into the evolution and relationships
  of these limpets within the archaeogastropod level and their differences from other
  prosobranchs.
