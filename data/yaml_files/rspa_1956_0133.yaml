tldr: 'This study investigates the process of severe metallic wear, specifically the
  wear of brass against harder materials. The research focuses on the relationship
  between metal transfer and the formation of wear particles. The authors discovered
  that the wear process has at least two distinct stages: the removal of metal from
  the wearing surface by transfer and the formation of wear debris from the transferred
  layer on the opposing member. The applied load determines the scale of the phenomena
  rather than the rate at which they occur.'
