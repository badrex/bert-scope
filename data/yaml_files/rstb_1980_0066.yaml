tldr: The article discusses the progress in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) zeugmatographic
  imaging, a technique that uses magnetic fields to generate images of biological
  systems. The authors describe the development of a whole-body imaging system, the
  use of magnetic reagents to increase specificity and versatility of measurements,
  and the potential of 31P NMR zeugmatography for human diagnostic studies and experiments
  on small animals. They also highlight the advantages of reconstruction techniques
  in NMR zeugmatographic imaging, such as simultaneous data acquisition and slow magnetic
  field configuration changes, which improve safety and reliability.
