tldr: Dr. John Wallis proposed a method to observe the parallax of fixed stars to
  determine their distances from Earth. He suggested using circumpolar stars and telescopes
  with micrometers to measure the stars' positions at different times of the year.
  Wallis believed that this method could prove that fixed stars have different distances
  from Earth and help improve the understanding of celestial bodies.
