tldr: The author presents a new method for determining half-value periods of radioactive
  substances using a single Geiger counter and a coincidence circuit. The method is
  based on the analysis of the distribution in time of the impulses recorded in the
  Geiger counter. The author demonstrates the technique by measuring the half-value
  periods of actinium, thorium A, and radium, and discusses the limitations and possible
  sources of error in the method.
