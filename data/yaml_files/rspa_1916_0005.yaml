tldr: This paper investigates the skin friction of high winds on Earth's surface,
  proposing a theoretical model and comparing it to experimental data. The authors
  find that skin friction is proportional to the square of wind velocity and is consistent
  with laboratory experiments on small flat plates and pipes. The study contributes
  to understanding the interaction between the atmosphere and Earth's surface.
