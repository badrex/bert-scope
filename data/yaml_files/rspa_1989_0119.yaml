tldr: The article analyzes thermally driven shallow cavity flows in porous media,
  focusing on the merged-layer regime. The authors study the flow structure, core
  expansion, and boundary conditions, providing an approximate solution for the core
  and vertical boundary layers. The results are compared with numerical computations
  and heat transfer predictions, offering insights into the behavior of natural convection
  in porous media.
