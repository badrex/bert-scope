tldr: This article discusses the pericellular environment and its regulation in vertebrate
  cartilage tissues. It examines the ultrastructure and histochemistry of the pericellular
  region, focusing on the distribution of proteoglycans and glycosaminoglycans, and
  how these change with cartilage aging. The study provides insights into the structural
  and functional aspects of the pericellular environment in cartilage.
