tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine the magnetisation limit of iron
  using single-pole and double-pole methods. The results showed that the single-pole
  method provided a more accurate measurement of the magnetisation limit. The tractive
  force increased with the length of the wire up to 10 inches, beyond which no higher
  degree of magnetisation was obtained.
