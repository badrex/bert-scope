tldr: The article demonstrates that rescaling a perturbation series can yield accurate
  analytic approximations to eigenvalues in divergent-asymptotic perturbation problems.
  This approach is applied to various regimes, including the perturbation regime and
  the W.K.B. regime, and is shown to be effective in accurately estimating eigenvalues
  for Schrödinger eigenvalue problems.
