tldr: The authors developed a method to examine the optical constants of thin mercury
  films. They constructed a chamber to prepare and maintain clean, dry nitrogen environments
  for the mercury surfaces. By measuring the reflection and transmission of light
  through the films, they determined the optical properties and surface characteristics
  of the mercury. The study provided valuable insights into the behavior of inhomogeneous
  surfaces and the potential applications of thin films in various fields.
