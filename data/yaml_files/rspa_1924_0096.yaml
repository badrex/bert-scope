tldr: The author's experiments with optically excited mercury atoms demonstrate the
  controlled transfer of electrons between orbits. By illuminating mercury vapor with
  various combinations of monochromatic light, the author observed changes in the
  emission spectrum, providing evidence for step-by-step electron transfers between
  orbits. This study contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the behavior
  of electrons in atoms.
