tldr: The author conducted experiments to measure the vapour-pressures of ice, camphor,
  benzene, acetic acid, and water. They found that the vapour-pressure of a solid
  is less than that of a liquid at the same temperature, and that the differences
  between these pressures can be calculated from thermic data. The author also introduced
  a new method for determining the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids, which offers
  significant advantages over previous methods.
