tldr: The author, John F. W. Herschel, introduces a new method for integrating periodic
  series and circulating functions, which are series with terms that follow a recurring
  pattern. He demonstrates how to use a theorem involving the roots of equations to
  integrate these series and solve equations of finite differences. This method can
  be applied to various types of series and is useful in analyzing complex mathematical
  problems.
