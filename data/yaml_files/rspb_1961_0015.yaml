tldr: The study investigates the functional organization of the cuttlefish brain,
  Sepia officinalis, through electrical stimulation. The research reveals new divisions
  in the brain and classifies the suboesophageal centers as lower and intermediate
  motor centers. The supraoesophageal lobes contain higher motor centers and silent
  areas. The findings are discussed in terms of Sanders & Young's physiological classification
  of the brain.
