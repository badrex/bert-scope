tldr: The author conducted experiments with the bacteria Bacillus coli, exposing them
  to the dye Brilliant Green. They discovered that two permanent varieties arose from
  one original organism under these conditions. One variety was slightly modified
  by the dye and remained resistant, while the other underwent profound and progressive
  changes. This study highlights the potential for variation in organisms and the
  possibility of acquiring new traits through environmental factors.
