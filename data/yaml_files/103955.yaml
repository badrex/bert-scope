tldr: A case study of nine people who were accidentally poisoned by henbane roots,
  which they mistook for parsnips. The patients showed symptoms of madness, convulsions,
  and speechlessness. Dr. Patouillat treated them with various antidotes and found
  that they all recovered, but experienced a temporary red-tinted vision as a side
  effect.
