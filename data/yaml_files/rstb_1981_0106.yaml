  on Platelet Function

tldr: This article discusses inherited blood disorders, Glanzmann's thrombasthenia
  and Bernard-Soulier syndrome, which affect platelet function during hemostasis.
  Both disorders have deficiencies in different membrane glycoproteins, suggesting
  specific roles for these proteins in platelet function. The article highlights the
  importance of membrane glycoproteins in platelet surface contact interactions and
  their impact on platelet aggregation and clot retraction.
