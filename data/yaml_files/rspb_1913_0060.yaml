tldr: Researchers successfully cultivated the benign and malignant tertian malarial
  parasites in culture tubes and studied their growth and sporulation. They found
  that the optimum temperature for cultivation is around 38Â°C and that the presence
  of leucocytes and complement is not necessary for successful cultivation. The study
  also observed variations in the rate of growth and sporulation of the parasites,
  which may be influenced by factors such as the age of the parasites, the quantity
  of glucose, and the previous administration of quinine.
