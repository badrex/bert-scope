tldr: The author conducted experiments to analyze the constitution of prussic, ferruretted
  chyazic, and sulphuretted chyazic acids and their salts. They applied Dalton's atomic
  theory and Berzelius's addition to analyze the combinations of oxidized bodies.
  The author also described their method for analyzing these acids, which involved
  decomposing the salts and determining the quantities of various elements present.
