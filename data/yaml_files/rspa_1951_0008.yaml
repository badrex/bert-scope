tldr: This study investigates the orientation and structure of fatty acid and soap
  films on metal surfaces using electron diffraction. The research focuses on the
  effect of temperature on the orientation of these films, revealing a transition
  temperature at which the films lose their characteristic orientation. The findings
  provide insights into the properties of thin films in contact with metal substrates
  and their role in boundary lubrication.
