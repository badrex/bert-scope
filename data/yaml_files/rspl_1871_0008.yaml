revised_title: Numerical Values of Logarithms and Euler's Constant
scientific_discipline: Mathematics > Number Theory
semantic_tags:

tldr: The author recalculates the numerical values of log2, log3, log5, and log10,
  as well as the modulus of the common system of logarithms, to 205 decimals. They
  also calculate the value of Euler's Constant and explore methods for summing the
  harmonic series. This work provides accurate and extended values for mathematicians
  and contributes to the understanding of logarithms and number theory.
