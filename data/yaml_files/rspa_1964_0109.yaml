tldr: The author presents a method to determine the approximate elastic critical loads
  of rigidly jointed plane frameworks with redundant members. The method involves
  expressing the load pattern as a function of the unknown forces in one non-redundant
  member and the redundant members. By maximizing the load pattern subject to the
  elliptical approximation, an estimate of the elastic critical load of the redundant
  framework is obtained.
