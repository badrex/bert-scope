tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the effect of longitudinal magnetic fields
  on the internal viscosity of iron and nickel wires by observing the rate of subsidence
  of torsional oscillations. They found that the rate of subsidence decreased with
  increased magnetising force in iron wires, while in nickel wires, the rate of subsidence
  initially increased and then decreased with further increase in the magnetising
  force. These results provide insights into the nature of magnetisation and the internal
  friction of magnetisable materials.
