tldr: This study investigates the relationship between consumption, growth, and protein
  synthesis in individual rainbow trout held in groups. The research found that fractional
  rates of protein growth and synthesis increased with consumption rate, while degradation
  rates were independent of consumption. More efficient fish had reduced degradation
  rates, which could explain the observed differences in protein growth efficiency.
  The results support the hypothesis that individual differences in protein turnover
  are important determinants of growth efficiency in fish.
