tldr: The author conducted experiments with eccentric oblate bodies and disks as projectiles
  to improve gun design. They found that by adjusting the center of gravity and using
  a disk with a zone of 60°, they could achieve a greater initial velocity and better
  sustained terminal velocity compared to spherical shot and rifle projectiles. The
  author also discussed the history of the eccentric principle and its applications
  in warfare.
