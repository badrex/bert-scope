tldr: The author, John Arbuthnott, argues for the existence of divine providence through
  the constant regularity observed in the balance of male and female births. Using
  mathematical calculations and probability theory, he demonstrates that the equal
  number of males and females is not a result of chance but a deliberate design by
  a higher power. He also discusses the implications of this balance on polygamy and
  the propagation of the human race.
