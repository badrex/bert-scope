tldr: This article discusses the life and work of William Prout, a pioneering physician
  and chemist who made significant contributions to the fields of biochemistry, medical
  history, and the study of atomic weights of elements. Prout is best known for his
  eponymous "Prout's Law," which proposed that the atomic weights of all elements
  are exact multiples of the atomic weight of hydrogen. He also made the monumental
  physiological discovery that the human stomach secretes free hydrochloric acid and
  was a notable pioneer of organic analysis and biochemistry.
