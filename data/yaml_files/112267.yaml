tldr: The author, Francis Galton, explains the development of cyclone theory, stating
  that a circumscribed area of barometric depression is usually a locus of light ascending
  currents, leading to an indraught of surface winds that create a retrograde whirl.
  He also discusses the role of barometric elevation in creating dispersion of descending
  currents and the appearance of a calm center with radial currents. Galton suggests
  that polar cyclones would have a direct rotation, and that the existence of an intermediate
  area of direct rotation would make the movements of the entire system correlative
  and harmonious.
