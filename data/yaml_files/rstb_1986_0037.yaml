tldr: The article describes the structure and optics of the compound eyes of the neritic
  sergestid shrimp, Acetes sibogae, and how they adapt to light-dark conditions. The
  eyes are nearly spherical and heavily pigmented, and the authors discuss the various
  components of the eye, including the corneal lens, crystalline cone, and rhabdom.
  They also explore how the eye's structure relates to the natural history of Acetes
  and its adaptations to different light conditions.
