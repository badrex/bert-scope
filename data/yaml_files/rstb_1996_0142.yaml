tldr: This study examines the predation risk and prey selection of sparrowhawks on
  passerine birds during the breeding season. The research focuses on factors such
  as body size, abundance, foraging behavior, and reproductive behavior of prey species.
  The findings provide insights into the impact of predation on the morphology, reproductive
  behavior, and other characteristics of prey species, and contribute to a better
  understanding of predation as a selection pressure in birds.
