tldr: The author discusses the concept of obligate parasitism in fungi, focusing on
  the biochemical and physiological factors that contribute to their dependence on
  living host cells. The lecture covers various categories of parasitism, including
  ecologically and physiologically obligate parasites, and highlights the challenges
  in cultivating these fungi in axenic culture. The author also presents examples
  of fungal groups that are considered obligate parasites, such as downy mildews,
  white blisters, club-root pathogens, and powdery mildews, which have significant
  economic impacts on crop plants.
