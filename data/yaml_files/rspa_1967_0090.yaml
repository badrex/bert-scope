tldr: The co-oxidation of aluminium trimethyl and organic compounds, such as propylene,
  dimethylamine, and ethane, has been studied. The results show that the oxidation
  of the organic compounds is induced at low temperatures. The mechanism involves
  a free-radical chain reaction, with the most likely initiating step being the attack
  on the additives by the dimethylaluminiumoxy radical. The presence of organic compounds
  affects the ignition tendency and the production of various gaseous products, such
  as hydrogen, ethylene, and carbon dioxide.
