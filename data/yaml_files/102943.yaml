tldr: Francis Hauksbee conducted an experiment to understand why the mercury in barometers
  descends during storms. He observed that the mercury in the barometer subsided and
  showed a visible vibration during a violent storm. Hauksbee designed an apparatus
  to demonstrate this phenomenon, which involved a syphon, a swan-neck pipe, and two
  barometers. The experiment showed that the descent of mercury in the barometer was
  due to the lessened pressure of the atmosphere, and as the air current weakened,
  the atmospheric pressure increased, causing the mercury to ascend.
