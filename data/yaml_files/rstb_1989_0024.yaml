tldr: The authors determined the three-dimensional structures of the Mahoney strain
  of type 1 and the Sabin strain of type 3 polioviruses using X-ray crystallography.
  This allowed them to identify the antigenic sites on the virus surface, which are
  important for understanding the immune system's interaction with viral antigens.
  They also found that the structural differences between the two strains provide
  insight into the serotypic differences between polioviruses.
