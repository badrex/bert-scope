tldr: The authors investigated the copolymerization of styrene and butyl acrylate
  using benzoyl peroxide as an initiator. They determined the monomer reactivity ratios
  and found that styrene radicals react with butyl acrylate radicals more quickly
  than the mean rate of reaction of styrene to styrene and butyl acrylate to butyl
  acrylate radicals. The coefficient defining this increased activity is not constant
  and increases with the styrene content.
