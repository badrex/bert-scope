tldr: The authors investigated ferromagnetic resonance absorption in colloidal suspensions
  of pure metals and alloys, focusing on nickel-iron alloys. They found that the spectroscopic
  splitting factor for iron is approximately 2, and for nickel, it is around 2. In
  nickel-iron alloys, there is an anomaly near 40% nickel, where the -factor falls
  to 1. The measured line width is dependent on the composition of the alloys and
  is a minimum where the anisotropy constant passes through zero for iron-nickel alloys.
