tldr: The author observed delicate strands of protoplasm connecting blastomeres in
  developing eggs. These strands, also known as pseudopodia, were present in various
  stages of development and appeared to play a role in coordinating the activities
  of the embryo. The author found that these strands were similar to the filose filaments
  described by Andrews in other organisms and believed they were essential for cell
  communication and coordination during early development.
