tldr: William Ritchie invents a new photometer that accurately measures the relative
  intensities of artificial light. The photometer works by comparing the amount of
  heat produced by light passing through two identical chambers, one facing the light
  source and the other facing a black surface that absorbs the light and converts
  it to heat. The instrument can be used to compare the intensity of light from different
  sources, such as candles or gas lights, and even determine the relative quantities
  of light given off by different types of gas.
