tldr: This study investigates the reaction of atomic oxygen with acetylene using a
  photoionization mass spectrometer. The researchers found that the primary reaction
  channels producing free radicals, such as HCCO and CH2, account for about 95% of
  the initial reaction path. The study provides detailed information on the primary
  and secondary intermediates and discusses the reaction mechanism.
