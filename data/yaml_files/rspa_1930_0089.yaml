tldr: This article investigates the excitation of soft X-rays from polycrystalline
  metal surfaces, focusing on nickel, cobalt, copper, and tungsten. The authors confirm
  the reality of inflexions in the X-ray emission and identify new inflections in
  the range of 235-2 to 317-9 volts. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of X-rays and their potential applications in various fields.
