tldr: George Dollond developed a concave achromatic lens that could increase the primary
  image of a telescope without increasing the diameter of the wires in the micrometer.
  This lens, named Macro-Micro, was tested by examining Saturn's satellites and the
  companion of k Geminorum, showing no significant difference in brightness. Professor
  Barlow provided formulae for constructing the lens.
