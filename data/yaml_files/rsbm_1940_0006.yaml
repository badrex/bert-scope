tldr: George Barger was a prominent chemist who made significant contributions to
  the fields of plant chemistry, drug standardization, and molecular weight determination.
  He is best known for his work on ergot alkaloids, including the discovery of ergotoxine
  and the study of its physiological effects. Barger's research also involved the
  determination of molecular weights using a comparative method and his work on plant
  glucosides, such as Saponarin. His achievements earned him a Fellowship at King's
  College, Cambridge, and a position at the Welcome Physiological Research Laboratories.
