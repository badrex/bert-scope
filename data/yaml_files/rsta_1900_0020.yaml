tldr: This article investigates the relationship between the ionization of dilute
  solutions and the depression of the freezing point. The author discusses the conductivity
  of dilute solutions and the ionization of potassium permanganate, bichromate, and
  ferricyanide in dilute solutions. The study aims to determine the coefficient of
  ionization and its connection to freezing point phenomena.
