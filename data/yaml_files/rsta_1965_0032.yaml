tldr: This article discusses the structural unity of the reconstructed North Atlantic
  continent and its geological provinces. The author proposes that these provinces
  are the disrupted fragments of one continuous continent and that they have an essential
  structural unity. The article also examines the concept of chelogenic cycles and
  their relation to the continental drift and the development of major structural
  provinces.
