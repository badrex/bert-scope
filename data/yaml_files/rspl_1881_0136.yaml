tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the behavior of coal-dust in colliery
  explosions. They found that coal-dust can be ignited by fire-damp explosions, causing
  the flame to travel further and be self-sustaining. The author also observed that
  proper ventilation and preventing the accumulation of coal-dust can help prevent
  such accidents. These findings can help improve mine safety and prevent future colliery
  explosions.
