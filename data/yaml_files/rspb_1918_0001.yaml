tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the enzymes involved in the decomposition
  of glucose and mannitol by Bacillus coli communis. They developed a new method to
  separate the process of growth from fermentation, using an emulsion of the bacteria
  to decompose glucose and mannitol. This research provided insights into the bacterial
  fermentation process and the role of enzymes in breaking down sugars.
