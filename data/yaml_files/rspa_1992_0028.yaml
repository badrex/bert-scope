tldr: The authors study planar diffeomorphisms in nonlinear vibrations and derive
  six closure relations that relate the invariant manifolds of a hilltop saddle cycle
  to other invariant sets. These relations help in understanding the organization
  and behavior of nonlinear phenomena in these systems, such as multiple coexisting
  stable periodic solutions, period-doubling cascades, and homoclinic tangencies.
