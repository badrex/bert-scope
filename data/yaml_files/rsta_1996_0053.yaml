tldr: The authors estimate the chemical composition of the Earth's lower mantle using
  the most reliable equation of state for perovskite obtained through in-situ X-ray
  diffraction studies. They compare the density profile and temperature gradient of
  various compositions with the preliminary reference Earth model (PREM) and find
  that the mixing ratio of perovskite and magnesiowustite should be in the range of
  2:1 to 3:1 when the total iron content is about 0.11.
