tldr: This paper investigates the velocity of sound by comparing Laplace's corrected
  formula with Dulong's theoretical investigation and the experiments of Drs. Moll
  and Van Beek. The author applies coefficients to the formula to improve the accuracy
  of calculated velocities and discusses the remaining differences between calculation
  and experiment, attributing them to unavoidable errors in complex observations.
