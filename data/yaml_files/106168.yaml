tldr: The author, John Hunter, conducted a detailed study on the anatomy of the Torpedo
  fish, focusing on its electric organs. He discovered the structure and function
  of these organs, which are responsible for the fish's ability to produce electric
  shocks. Hunter described the location, shape, and size of the electric organs, as
  well as the columns within them and their connections to the nervous system. He
  suggested that these nerves might be involved in the formation, collection, or management
  of the electric fluid, which is controlled by the will of the animal.
