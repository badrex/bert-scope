tldr: Thomas Graham's study focuses on the molecular mobility of gases and their diffusion
  through porous materials, such as artificial graphite. He explains the process of
  gas diffusion and the factors affecting it, including the role of molecular movement
  and the properties of porous materials. Graham also discusses the use of the diffusiometer,
  a device that measures the rate of gas diffusion through a porous plate, and the
  resistance offered by capillary tubes to the passage of gases.
