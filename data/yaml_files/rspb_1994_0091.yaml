tldr: The study examines parallels between two species of lizards on the islands of
  Dominica and Basse Terre, showing that similar ecological gradients influence morphological
  and mitochondrial DNA variation. The findings support the idea that natural selection
  plays a role in shaping these patterns, rather than historical events or genetic
  drift.
