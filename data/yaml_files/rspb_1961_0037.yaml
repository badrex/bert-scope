tldr: This study investigates the transmission of anti-Salmonella agglutinins from
  mother hedgehogs to their young and the active immunization of suckling hedgehogs.
  The research shows that transmission of passive immunity in hedgehogs occurs both
  before and after birth, with the majority happening after birth. The study also
  demonstrates that suckling hedgehogs can produce their own antibodies during the
  period when antibodies are being absorbed from the milk.
