tldr: Researchers studied the development and formation of the chiral ultrastructure
  of coccoliths in the marine alga Emiliania huxleyi. They used electron microscopy
  to observe the growth stages and found that the earliest stages are characterized
  by an elliptical proto-coccolith ring of discrete single crystals of calcite. The
  chiral ultrastructure suggests that the calcite crystals are enclosed within vesicles
  that are laid down in a chiral arrangement.
