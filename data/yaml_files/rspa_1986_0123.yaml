tldr: This study investigates pseudostationary oblique shock-wave reflections in sulphur
  hexafluoride (SF6) using interferometric and numerical methods. The four main types
  of shock-wave reflection - regular, single-Mach, complex-Mach, and double-Mach -
  were observed and analyzed. The results provide insight into the complex-flow fields
  and help establish the transition boundaries between different types of shock-wave
  reflections. The study also highlights the importance of real-gas effects in non-stationary
  shock-wave systems.
