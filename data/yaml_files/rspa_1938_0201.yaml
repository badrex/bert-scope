tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the pressure waves and vortex motion
  caused by an airscrew in motion at high speeds. They used a direct shadow method
  to photograph the pressure wave system and developed a method to estimate the pressure
  amplitude of the wave. The findings provide insights into the formation of sound
  waves and the potential for reducing airscrew noise.
