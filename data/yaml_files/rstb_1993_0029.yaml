tldr: The article describes the structure and function of a chaperonin from a thermophilic
  bacterium, Thermus thermophilus. The chaperonin consists of homologues to GroEL
  (cpn 60) and GroES (cpn 10) and shows a bullet-like shape in electron microscopy.
  The chaperonin's ability to induce productive folding, slow down folding rates,
  and arrest folding at different temperature ranges is discussed. The article also
  proposes a "folding intermediate reservoir" model to explain the chaperonin's function.
