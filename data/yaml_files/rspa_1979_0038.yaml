tldr: The author examines the Landau equation, a typical equation for weakly coupled
  gases, and discusses its derivation and solution. They propose an approximate solution
  scheme for the relaxation of two homogeneous plasmas at different temperatures and
  compare it with a conventional numerical scheme. The Landau equation cannot be used
  in a finite difference solution starting from infinity, so a series expansion is
  needed to begin the integration. The limits of integration in the equation must
  be restricted, and the author examines the reasons for this.
