tldr: This study investigates the visco-elastic behavior of lubricating oils under
  cyclic shearing stress. The authors measured the mechanical impedance of three different
  lubricating oils and analyzed the results in terms of a relaxation spectrum. They
  found that the oils' behavior can be described by a universal curve, and the differences
  in their relaxation spectra are due to varying proportions of hydrocarbon types.
  The study also discusses the connection between shear relaxation and the glass transition
  temperature.
