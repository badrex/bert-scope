tldr: The author presents a perturbation procedure to determine the characteristic
  values and corresponding angular functions of mass-dependent spheroidal harmonics
  of spin one-half in Kerr geometry. The method applies to other cases considered
  in the literature and provides a more convergent expansion than previous methods.
  The study focuses on the mass of particles and their impact on the angular functions
  in Dirac's equation.
