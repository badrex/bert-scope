tldr: The author, Thomas Bugge, observed the culmination of Saturn using a 6-feet
  achromatic transit-instrument and calculated its heliocentric longitude. By comparing
  the observed geocentric longitude of Saturn with the tables of Dr. Halley and M.
  de la Land, Bugge determined the error in the place of the node and provided a method
  to improve the accuracy of such calculations. This research contributed to a better
  understanding of planetary orbits and the precision of astronomical instruments.
