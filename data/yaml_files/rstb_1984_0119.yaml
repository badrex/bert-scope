tldr: The article discusses the role of red cell sialoglycoproteins, specifically
  glycophorins, in the invasion of human red cells by merozoites of Plasmodium falciparum.
  The authors found that red cells deficient in glycophorins resist infection by the
  parasite to varying degrees, suggesting that these molecules play a crucial role
  in the invasion process. The study also explores the interaction between merozoites
  and red cell receptors, and the potential use of these receptors in the search for
  potential plasmodial immunogens.
