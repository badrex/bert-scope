tldr: This study investigates the influence of nitrogen peroxide on the two-stage
  ignition of hydrocarbons, such as propane, n-butane, and acetaldehyde. The results
  show that nitrogen peroxide has a dual effect on the ignition process, inhibiting
  the reactions leading to cool flames and promoting direct oxidation. Large amounts
  of nitrogen peroxide can also exhibit an anti-catalytic influence, possibly due
  to self-neutralization of active centers.
