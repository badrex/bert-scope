tldr: This article discusses the distribution of tectonic stress in the lithosphere
  and how it is controlled by thermo-rheological and geodynamic factors. The authors
  propose a constant force model that predicts a transient stress distribution with
  depth, overcoming the limitations of the constant strain-rate model. They also explore
  how the geothermal gradient, crustal composition, and thickness affect the lithosphere's
  stress-depth relationship and how changes in tectonic force over time can lead to
  reversals in stress with depth.
