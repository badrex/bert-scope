tldr: The authors conducted an experimental investigation on intramolecularly crosslinked
  polymer molecules, specifically polystyrene. They used techniques like light scattering,
  osmometry, viscometry, and gel permeation chromatography to measure molecular masses,
  molecular mass distribution, and radii of gyration. The results were compared with
  theoretical predictions, providing insights into the behavior of crosslinked polymers
  and their dimensions.
