tldr: The authors develop a general formula for the probability of genetical recombination,
  which can be used to calculate map distances and recombination fractions between
  any pair of markers. They explore the genetic consequences of different intercept
  length distributions and find that the theory of interference based on these distributions
  is more in line with observed genetic evidence. This work provides a flexible and
  realistic approach to understanding genetical recombination and its impact on linkage
  mapping.
