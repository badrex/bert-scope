tldr: The authors developed a new magnetometer to measure the Earth's magnetic field.
  The magnetometer uses a Helmholtz coil system to create a field equal and opposite
  to the Earth's vertical component. The device allows for precise measurements and
  can be used in various locations and orientations. This innovation helps improve
  our understanding of the Earth's magnetic field and its effects on our planet.
