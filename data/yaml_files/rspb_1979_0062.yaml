tldr: This article presents a comprehensive account of wavelength and colour saturation
  discrimination using optimum probabilistic signal detection. The theory is based
  on statistical estimation and postulates that discriminability is limited by stochastic
  uncertainty in the trichromatic responses of the visual system. The study extends
  the concept of optimal statistical communication to colour perception, providing
  a framework that accommodates classical phenomena in colour vision.
