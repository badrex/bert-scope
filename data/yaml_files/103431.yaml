tldr: The author observed a rainbow on the ground while riding near Oxford. The rainbow
  was an oblong shape, a portion of an hyperbola, with its convex part turned towards
  the eye. The colors were more vibrant near the observer. The author explained how
  the dimensions of the rainbow can be determined using the angle and the sun's altitude.
