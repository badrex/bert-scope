tldr: John Adair Barker was a prominent chemist and theoretical chemist known for
  his work on the liquid state. He contributed to the development of lattice models
  and perturbation theory, which helped create a quantitative theory of liquids. Barker's
  work on lattice models and intermolecular forces led to a better understanding of
  the properties of liquid mixtures and their thermodynamic behavior.
