tldr: This study investigates the rate and pressure relations in the thermal decomposition
  of diethyl ether. The authors found that the rate of decomposition increases with
  pressure, and hydrogen and chemically inert gases have different effects on the
  reaction. The results provide insights into the complex patterns of unimolecular
  reactions and the role of inhibitors in controlling reaction rates.
