tldr: The authors extended and improved previous observations of the Tl I absorption
  spectrum in the vacuum ultraviolet using a synchrotron radiation source. They discovered
  new structure and several autoionizing resonances, providing a more comprehensive
  understanding of the spectrum and its underlying processes.
