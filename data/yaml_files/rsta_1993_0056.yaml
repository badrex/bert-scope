tldr: This article discusses the transport and distribution of suspended particulate
  matter (SPM) in the North Sea. The authors present field observations and model
  simulations to understand the mass balance of SPM, which is influenced by input
  from rivers, atmosphere, and adjacent seas, as well as deposition and resuspension
  at the sea bottom. The study aims to develop a verified three-dimensional transport
  model to interpret existing data and make reliable scenario calculations.
