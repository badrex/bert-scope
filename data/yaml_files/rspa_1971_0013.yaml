tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis and computer simulation of the
  growth of epitaxial films. The authors derive equations that describe the growth
  of islands on a crystalline substrate and attempt to define the limits of their
  application in a physical system. They also discuss the selection of initial nuclei,
  coalescence logic, and variations in growth parameters. The study provides a starting
  point for understanding the growth process of epitaxial films.
