tldr: The author presents a new approach to classical electrodynamics of a point particle
  using a non-singular current. This current, called a pointlike current, is used
  in the standard action integral to create a non-singular theory. The theory conserves
  energy-momentum and angular momentum and is applicable to particles with arbitrary
  finite electromagnetic moments.
