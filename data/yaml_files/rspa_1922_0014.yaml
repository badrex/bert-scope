tldr: This article presents a comprehensive analysis of the diffraction of plane electromagnetic
  waves by a perfectly reflecting sphere. The author discusses various methods to
  solve the problem, including series solutions, transformations, and contour integrals.
  The study provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of electromagnetic waves
  near a large sphere and contributes to the field of wireless communication and physical
  optics.
