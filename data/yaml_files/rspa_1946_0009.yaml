tldr: In this address, Sir Henry Dale highlights the achievements of Dr. Oswald Avery,
  who contributed to the understanding of the chemical basis of bacterial properties,
  particularly the pneumococcus. He also recognizes Professor John Desmond Bernal
  for his work in X-ray crystallography, which helped elucidate the structure of complex
  organic molecules and proteins. Lastly, Dr. Edward James Salisbury is acknowledged
  for his significant contributions to plant ecology, broadening the study of British
  plant communities and relating horticultural practices to known physiological and
  ecological facts.
