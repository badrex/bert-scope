tldr: The authors present a method for selecting cycle bases of minimal measure in
  the flexibility analysis of skeletal structures. They introduce a finite sub-set
  of the cycle vector space containing elements of all minimal cycle bases, making
  it possible to use an optimal combinatorial approach for structural analysis.
