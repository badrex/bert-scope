tldr: The author studied the life-cycle and development of Trypanosoma gambiense,
  a parasite responsible for African sleeping sickness, in both Glossina (tsetse flies)
  and monkeys. They discovered that the parasite undergoes different stages in the
  fly and monkey hosts, with the tsetse fly being the primary vector for transmission
  to humans. The study provides insights into the parasite's development and potential
  strategies for controlling the disease.
