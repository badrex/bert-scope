tldr: This article discusses the structure and evolution of the Red Sea and the relationship
  between tectonics and magmatology in the northern Danakil Depression, Ethiopia.
  The authors investigate the geology of the area, focusing on the tectonic relations
  between the Danakil Depression and the African Rift System, as well as the extensive
  and largely unknown volcanism of the region. They analyze various volcanic units
  and their petrological and geochemical data, concluding that the sialic crust is
  missing beneath the northern part of the Danakil Depression, except below the two
  en echelon elongated volcanic ranges.
