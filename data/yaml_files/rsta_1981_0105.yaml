tldr: The article discusses the origin and evolution of Earth's continental crust,
  focusing on the growth and differentiation of the crust from the mantle. It explains
  how the continental crust has evolved through various geological processes, such
  as subduction, accretion, and differentiation, and how these processes have affected
  the mass and composition of the crust over time. The article also highlights the
  importance of isotope systematics in understanding the history of the Earth's crust.
