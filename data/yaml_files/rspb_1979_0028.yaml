tldr: The authors studied the morphology and range of variation in Calliacantha Leadbeater,
  a type of choanoflagellate, using light microscopy, transmission electron microscopy,
  and scanning electron microscopy. They discovered significant differences between
  the species and found that specimens from various parts of the world exhibited a
  range of morphological variations. The authors propose that these differences may
  indicate the presence of multiple species or sub-species within the Calliacantha
  genus.
