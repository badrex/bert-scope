tldr: The author investigates the blue pigment in the petals of the blue pansy "Emperor
  William" and identifies it as "Violanin," a rhamno-glucoside of delphinidin. The
  blue color is due to the presence of this pigment in the form of a potassium salt.
  Additionally, the author finds a significant amount of a flavonol glucoside, rutin,
  in the pansy, which is a rhamno-glucoside of quercetin.
