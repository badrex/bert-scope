tldr: The author, John Davy, discovered a gaseous compound of carbonic oxide and chlorine.
  This compound was formed when equal parts of the gases were exposed to sunlight.
  The new gas had unique properties, such as combining with ammonia to form a neutral
  salt and decomposing dry subcarbonate of ammonia. The gas could also be used to
  separate metals from their compounds and was remarkable for its power of saturation.
