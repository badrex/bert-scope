tldr: This article compares the barograph records at Oxford and Kew during storms,
  showing that changes in pressure at Oxford were followed by similar changes at Kew,
  but nearly an hour later. The author suggests that increasing the number of stations
  and using additional instruments like thermographs and anemometers would improve
  our understanding of atmospheric disturbances.
