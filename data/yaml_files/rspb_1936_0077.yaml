tldr: The study investigates the effects of anti-gonadotropic serum on the reproductive
  organs of normal animals. The serum, prepared by injecting gonadotropic extracts
  into rabbits, prevents ovulation in rabbits and causes atrophic changes similar
  to those following hypophysectomy. The research also explores the differences in
  immunological responses to follicle-stimulating and ovulation-producing substances,
  providing evidence for their separate identities.
