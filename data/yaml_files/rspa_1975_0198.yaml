tldr: The article investigates the equilibrium shape of a horizontal row of two-dimensional
  drops approaching their homophase at a fluid/liquid interface. The authors use analytical
  equations and elliptic integrals to study the shape and behavior of the drops, providing
  insights into the coalescence of drops in a row and the approach of a row of cylinders
  to a fluid/liquid interface.
