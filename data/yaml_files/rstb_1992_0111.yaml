tldr: This study investigates hand-eye coordination in sequential tasks, focusing
  on eye fixations used for hand movements. The research demonstrates that eye fixations
  are employed not only for terminal phases of hand movements but also for other tasks
  before and after. The analysis of spatial and temporal details of these fixations
  suggests that the underlying decision process leaves key decisions until just before
  they are required, indicating the importance of sensory-motor interaction in complex
  tasks.
