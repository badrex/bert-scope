tldr: This article discusses mass transport and chemical reactions in Taylor-vortex
  flows with entrained catalytic particles, focusing on applications to a novel class
  of immobilized enzyme biochemical reactors. The authors analyze the behavior of
  solute tracers in these systems, considering factors such as molecular diffusion,
  interphase solute transport, and reaction rates. They derive macroscale transport
  equations and provide insights into the design and optimization of these reactors
  for efficient biocatalytic processes.
