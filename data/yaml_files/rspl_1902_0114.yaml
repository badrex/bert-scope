tldr: Sir Oliver Lodge and his team developed an improved coherer design for detecting
  Hertzian waves. The new coherer is a modification of Lord Rayleigh's mercury coherer
  and is more sensitive and reliable. It uses a rotating steel wheel touching a pool
  of mercury with a thin layer of oil in between. The wheel breaks the circuit instantly
  after a signal is detected, allowing for rapid signal reception. This design is
  considered trustworthy and effective in detecting Hertzian waves.
