tldr: The author conducted experiments using carbon as a secondary radiator to study
  the polarization of secondary Röntgen radiation. They discovered that the secondary
  radiation proceeding from carbon in a direction perpendicular to the primary radiation's
  propagation is polarized, providing evidence for the theory of secondary X-rays
  production in substances of low atomic weight.
