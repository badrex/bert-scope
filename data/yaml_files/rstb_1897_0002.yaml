tldr: The author conducted experiments on animals to study the effects of interrupting
  the afferent and efferent tracts of the cerebellum. They found that dividing the
  inferior cerebellar peduncle caused disturbances in coordination and movement, while
  partial hemisection of the medulla resulted in general convulsions. These findings
  provide insights into the role of the cerebellum in controlling motor functions
  and its connections with other brain regions.
