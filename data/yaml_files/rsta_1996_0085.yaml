tldr: This special issue explores the significance of curved surfaces and triply periodic
  minimal surfaces in modern structural and synthetic chemistry. It highlights the
  progress and excitement in solids with three-dimensional surfaces, their relevance
  to chemical and crystallographic taxonomy, and their impact on materials science
  and applied chemistry. The volume covers various milestones and growth points, including
  fullerenes and mesoporous silica, and their applications in shape-selective catalysis,
  biomineralization, nanotechnology, and more.
