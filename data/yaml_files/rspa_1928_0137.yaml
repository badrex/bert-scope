tldr: This article examines the detonation wave and pre-detonation period in gaseous
  mixtures, focusing on the shock waves and their effects on flame propagation. The
  study investigates the conditions under which detonation is set up and maintained,
  and how these waves contribute to the different modes of flame propagation. The
  research also explores the inception of detonation in gaseous mixtures and the role
  of compression waves in the initial phases of explosions.
