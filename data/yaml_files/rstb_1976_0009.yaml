tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis of porphyrins, chlorophyll, and vitamin
  B, focusing on the decarboxylation pathways and the enzymes involved. The authors
  study the intermediates between uroporphyrinogen III and coproporphyrinogen III,
  as well as the conversion of propionic acid side chains to vinyl groups in protoporphyrin
  IX. They also investigate the excretion of porphyrins in rats poisoned with hexachlorobenzene
  and the possible alternate pathways in abnormal metabolism.
