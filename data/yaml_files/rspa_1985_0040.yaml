tldr: The authors combine experimental and ab initio results to derive in-crystal
  ionic polarizabilities and develop a model to describe the variation of anion and
  cation polarizabilities in different crystal environments. They find that the environmental
  effect on anion polarizability can be parametrized using the ionic separation, and
  propose a polynomial function to fit the logarithm of anion polarizability. This
  model allows for the deduction of cation polarizabilities in various compounds,
  providing a reliable set of ionic polarizabilities.
