tldr: The authors studied the distal and proximal synapses in the stellate ganglion
  of the squid Loligo vulgaris. They found that the giant synapse has a unique structure
  and is one of the few neuro-neuronal synapses where it is possible to insert microelectrodes
  into both presynaptic and postsynaptic fibers. The study provides insights into
  the structure and function of the giant synapse, which has been used for research
  on the mechanism of transmitter release and the role of various ions in the process.
