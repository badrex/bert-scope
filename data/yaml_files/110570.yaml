tldr: This article presents magnetical observations made in the West Indies, Brazil,
  and North America between 1834 and 1837. The observations were conducted to determine
  the dip, horizontal forces, and the effects of low fogs and stationary clouds on
  compass variation. The data collected was analyzed using an instrument of modern
  construction by Dollond, and the results were compared with direct experiments using
  the dipping needle.
