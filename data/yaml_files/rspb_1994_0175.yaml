tldr: The author explores the conflict hypothesis, which suggests that uniparental
  inheritance of cytoplasmic factors is a result of nuclear genes preventing intra-organism
  competition between potential antagonists. This hypothesis is supported by evidence
  from various organisms, including isogamous and anisogamous species. The author
  also discusses the implications of the conflict hypothesis for the evolution of
  uniparental transmission and inheritance of cytoplasmic factors.
