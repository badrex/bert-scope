tldr: The authors analyze various necrotic virus diseases in potatoes, such as streak,
  leaf-drop, and top-necrosis, and classify them based on their histological changes
  and the location and nature of the necrotic lesions. They also discuss the discovery
  of two unit viruses, X and Y, which play a significant role in causing these diseases.
  The study helps in understanding the behavior of these viruses on different potato
  varieties and their clinical pictures.
