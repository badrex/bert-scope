tldr: The author presents a study on hygrometry and barometry, discussing the elasticity
  of aqueous vapor at different temperatures and under various circumstances. He analyzes
  the force of vapor at different temperatures, the "moist bulb problem," and the
  constitution of mixed gases. The author also examines the question of whether aqueous
  vapor exists in the atmosphere as a mechanical mixture or chemical solution. Lastly,
  he investigates methods for determining heights using barometric observations and
  provides related tables.
