tldr: This article investigates the extension of cracks in isotropic materials and
  how the strains in the material at the extremity of a spreading crack affect its
  behavior. The author examines the relationship between shear and volume extension
  in solids and how these factors influence the limits of the material's properties.
  The study focuses on the development of cracks in isotropic materials and how the
  further spread of the crack depends on the action in the vicinity of its end.
