tldr: The author, Hans Sloane, describes a large feather from the bird Cuntur, found
  in Chili, and discusses its size and strength. He also provides a detailed description
  of the Coffee Shrub, its growth, and cultivation in Arabia Faelix. Sloane mentions
  that the Cuntur feather is 2 feet 4 inches long, and the quill part is 5 inches
  3/4 long. The feather is dark brown in color and was obtained from a bird that was
  shot near the sea. The Coffee Shrub is described as having a gray, almost smooth
  bark, with white wood and smooth, dark-colored bark on the twigs. The leaves are
  similar to those of a bay and the fruit hangs from the twig by an inch-long string
  or stalk.
