tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the magnetic permeability and
  magnetic susceptibility of liquid oxygen and liquid air. They developed a closed
  circuit transformer with a liquid core to measure the magnetic properties of these
  substances. The results showed that the magnetic permeability of liquid oxygen is
  greater than that of air or gaseous oxygen, indicating its unique magnetic properties.
