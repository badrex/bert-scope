tldr: This article explores the links between meteorites and asteroids, focusing on
  a case study of the asteroid Vesta and the Ca-rich achondrite Kapoeta. It discusses
  the methods of comparing asteroid and meteorite measurements and the potential for
  identifying specific asteroids as possible parent bodies of meteorites. The study
  emphasizes the importance of spectrophotometry in identifying mineral assemblages
  and the challenges in interpreting asteroidal spectra.
