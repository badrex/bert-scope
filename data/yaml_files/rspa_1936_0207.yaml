tldr: This article corrects some mistakes in a previous calculation of the elastic
  constants of alkali metals. It also explores the specific heats of these metals,
  comparing them to Debye's theory and experimental results. The author finds that
  the large deviations from a Debye function are due to the anisotropy and dispersion
  of the elements.
