tldr: The author, Abram Robertson, presents three direct and expeditious methods for
  calculating the excentric anomaly of a planet using a small angle and an equation
  with converging series. The methods are based on Cassini's approximation and can
  be applied to various examples, such as the orbits of planets and comets. These
  methods provide a precise and efficient way to determine the excentric anomaly in
  astronomy.
