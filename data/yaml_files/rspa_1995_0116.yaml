tldr: The author examines the equations of motion for incompressible viscous fluids
  and introduces the concept of the Reynolds number as a criterion for the onset of
  turbulence in fluid flow. The paper discusses the significance of this criterion
  and how it can be used to understand the behavior of fluids in various situations.
