tldr: This article discusses the evolution of sedimentary basins and graben formation
  in western and central Europe. It explores the different mechanisms that governed
  the development of these basins, including crustal extension, wrench-induced pull-apart
  features, and compression. The article also highlights the role of tensional and
  compressional tectonics in the formation of these basins and the impact of orogenic
  cycles on their development.
