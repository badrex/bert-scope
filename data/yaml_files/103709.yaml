tldr: The author, George Campbell, presents a method for determining the number of
  impossible roots in affected equations. He demonstrates this through various examples
  and lemmas, showing how to identify impossible roots and the relationship between
  different equations. This work contributes to the understanding of algebraic equations
  and their solutions.
