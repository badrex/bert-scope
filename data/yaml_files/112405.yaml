tldr: The author, John Tyndall, investigates the formation and properties of clouds
  through experiments with various substances and air pressures. He discovers that
  the size and stability of cloud particles depend on the density of the vapour and
  liquid, and that aqueous vapour produces the soft and tender beauty of atmospheric
  clouds. Tyndall also observes the different reflective energies and textures of
  clouds, as well as their diffraction phenomena.
