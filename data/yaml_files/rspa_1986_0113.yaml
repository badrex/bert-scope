tldr: This study investigates the direct initiation of detonation waves in a one-dimensional,
  plane, and spatially uniform combustible gas mixture. The authors use numerical
  simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to analyze the process of detonation
  formation, focusing on the interaction between chemical energy release and changes
  in pressure, temperature, and density. The research provides insights into the essential
  mechanisms of direct initiation processes and helps quantify the energy and power
  requirements for detonation initiation.
