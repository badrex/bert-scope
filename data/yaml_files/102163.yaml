tldr: Dr. Papin presents a new way to raise water using a unique engine. The engine
  consists of a glass container, a rock that constantly spouts water, and a crown
  that suspends the rock above the glass. This invention has potential applications
  in hydrostatics and could be further improved by other experts in the field.
