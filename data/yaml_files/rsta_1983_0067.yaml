tldr: This article examines the microstructure and hydration of cement clinker compounds
  using transmission electron microscopy (t.e.m.). The study focuses on pure tricalcium
  silicate and tricalcium aluminate, observing their lattice structures and early
  stages of hydration. The research also compares the microstructure of high-strength
  cement pastes with other pastes of low water content. The findings suggest that
  calcium chloride may accelerate hydration by improving access to the surface, while
  calcium sulfate retards hydration by blocking access to the surface.
