tldr: This study investigates the adhesion of epoxy resin to glass using a fracture
  mechanics test. The effects of adding silane coupling agents to the epoxy resin
  and the influence of water on adhesion were studied. The results show that the adhesive
  failure energy decreases with time, and the addition of silane coupling agents significantly
  improves the adhesion and durability of the epoxy resin-glass bond. The theory of
  generalized fracture mechanics is used to explain the findings.
