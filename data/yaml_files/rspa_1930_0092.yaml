tldr: This article presents experiments on total secondary electron emission from
  the 100 face of a nickel crystal. The results show a strong correlation between
  secondary electron discontinuities and soft X-ray inflections, suggesting that both
  phenomena are influenced by the same factors. The study provides insights into the
  behavior of electrons and their interaction with atoms in a crystal lattice, which
  could help improve our understanding of material properties and electronic devices.
