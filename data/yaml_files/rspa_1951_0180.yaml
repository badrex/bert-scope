tldr: The authors studied the solubilization of water in non-polar solvents using
  cationic detergents, specifically fatty acid salts of higher aliphatic primary amines.
  They found that the solubilizing power of these detergents depends on the acid part
  of the detergent molecule, the presence of additives, and the organic solvent used.
  The results were discussed in the context of Winsor's theory, which explains the
  solubilization process and the conditions for maximum solubilization.
