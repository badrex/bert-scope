tldr: This study investigates density, pressure, and temperature fluctuations in a
  turbulent mixing region using a mixing jet with variable Mach number and enthalpy.
  The density fluctuations are related to local pressure and temperature fluctuation
  intensities, and the results show that pressure fluctuations determined in this
  way agree with previous microphone-based observations. The study also highlights
  the influence of flow Mach number on the relative intensity of pressure and temperature
  fluctuations.
