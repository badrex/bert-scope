tldr: The author studied the cell inclusions and oogenesis in scorpions, focusing
  on the behavior of the nucleolus and the role of mitochondria and Golgi rods in
  the development of oocytes. They discovered differences in the nucleolus activity
  and the formation of cell inclusions in scorpions with and without ordinary yolk
  in their oocytes. The study revealed the transformation of the Golgi rods into Golgi
  yolk and the relationship between the nucleus and yolk formation.
