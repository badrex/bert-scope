tldr: The authors investigated the stability and dissociation of sheep haemoglobin
  at neutral pH using osmotic pressure measurements. They found that at low ionic
  strength, the haemoglobin molecule did not dissociate significantly, while at higher
  ionic strength, reversible dissociation was observed. The dissociation constants
  increased with increasing ionic strength and remained constant thereafter. This
  study provides important information on the extent of haemoglobin dissociation,
  which is crucial for understanding its physiological role and function.
