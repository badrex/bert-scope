tldr: This study examines the effects of electrical stimulation on a frog's heart
  and how these effects are modified by heat, cold, and drugs like strychnine. The
  researchers found that the heart's refractory period, the time during which it cannot
  respond to another stimulus, varies depending on the intensity of the stimulus and
  the conditions under which the heart is operated. Heat shortens the refractory period,
  while cold lengthens it. The study also shows that minimal and maximal stimulation
  of the heart can cause reduplication of beats and changes in the rhythm of the heart.
