tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the Precambrian crust, focusing on the
  development of high-grade terrains and greenstone belts. It highlights the importance
  of high-grade metamorphic rocks in understanding early crustal history and the role
  of plate tectonics in the Precambrian era. The article also emphasizes the need
  for more accurate radiometric age determinations to better understand the timing
  and processes of crustal development.
