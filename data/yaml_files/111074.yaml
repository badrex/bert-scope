tldr: In this paper, Michael Faraday investigates the behavior of diamagnetic metals,
  such as bismuth and phosphorus, when placed in a magnetic field. He examines whether
  the observed effects are due to polarity or induced currents. Faraday concludes
  that the phenomena are closely related to the effects of induced currents and that
  the idea of diamagnetic polarity has not yet gained additional proof beyond the
  fact that diamagnetic bodies are repelled by magnetic poles.
