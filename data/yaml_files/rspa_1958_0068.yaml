tldr: The authors studied the excitation of the OH spectra in hydrogen flames and
  found that the abnormal intensity distribution of certain bands is due to predissociation
  associated with an excess of free atoms in the flame. This process involves a direct
  bimolecular association of free atoms to form OH in an unstable state, followed
  by a radiationless transition to a stable state. This effect occurs under the same
  conditions as the strong lithium line emission, which is attributed to an excess
  population of hydrogen atoms.
