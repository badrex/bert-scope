tldr: The authors present a method for calculating solubilities and equilibrium constants
  of chemical reactions, as well as a formula for the latent heats of vaporization.
  They demonstrate the effectiveness of their method using examples of potassium bromide
  and other substances, and discuss the potential for applying this method to other
  cases.
