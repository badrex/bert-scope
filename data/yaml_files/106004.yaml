tldr: The author, Thomas Wright, observed the immersions and emersions of Jupiter's
  first satellite using a two-feet reflecting telescope at Jupiter's Inlet, Anticosti
  Island, North America. By comparing the observations with those made at the Royal
  Observatory at Greenwich, he determined the longitude of the place. The study highlights
  the difference in the clarity of the air at Anticosti Island and Greenwich, affecting
  the telescope's performance.
