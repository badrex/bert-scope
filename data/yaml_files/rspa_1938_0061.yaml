tldr: The authors studied the hyperfine structure, Zeeman effect, and isotope shift
  in the resonance lines of potassium using atomic beams and spectrograph techniques.
  They found that the component of longer wavelength is stronger in both the abundant
  and rare isotopes, and the results confirm the nuclear spin value. The study also
  provides insights into the Zeeman effect and the hyperfine structure of the resonance
  lines, contributing to the understanding of atomic physics.
