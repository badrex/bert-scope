tldr: The author, Balfour Stewart, conducted experiments to determine the specific
  gravity of mercury at different temperatures. They used a specific-gravity bottle
  and compared the results with Regnault's Table of the absolute dilatation of mercury
  and Despretz's Table of the absolute dilatation of water. The findings showed that
  the specific gravity of mercury was 13.594, which agreed closely with Regnault's
  previous determination.
