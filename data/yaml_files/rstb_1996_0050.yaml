tldr: This article discusses the role of TFIID, specifically TATA-binding protein
  (TBP) and associated factors (TAFs), in both transcriptional activation and repression.
  The author presents experiments that support the idea that TBP recruitment to a
  promoter can activate expression, and provides further evidence that the transcriptional
  repressor Even-skipped interacts with TBP. This highlights the importance of TBP
  in both activation and repression mechanisms in gene regulation.
