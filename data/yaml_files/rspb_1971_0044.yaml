tldr: The authors studied the parasympathetic neurons in the transparent interatrial
  septum of the frog to visually identify synaptic boutons on ganglion cells and varicosities
  in postganglionic axons. They used light and electron-microscopic techniques to
  confirm the identity of these structures and found that cholinergic varicosities
  have similar fine structural features as synaptic boutons on ganglion cells. This
  supports the idea that varicosities along postganglionic axons are a series of transmitter
  release sites.
