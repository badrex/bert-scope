tldr: The study investigates the influence of geographic isolation on the skull of
  the green monkey (Cercopithecus aethiops sabaeus) and the degree and speed of dental
  differentiation in the St Kitts green monkey. The research compares dental dimensions
  between the African and St Kitts green monkeys with other subspecies and species
  of the Cercopithecus genus. The findings show that the St Kitts green monkey's dental
  dimensions have increased significantly during the last 300 years, with the speed
  of change being much faster than the estimated rate of evolution in horses over
  millions of years.
