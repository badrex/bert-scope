tldr: This article explores the effect of local eigenstrain and eigenstress fields
  on the local strains and stresses in multiphase elastic solids. It introduces transformation
  influence functions and transformation concentration factor tensors to estimate
  the residual local fields caused by transformation fields. The self-consistent and
  Mori-Tanaka methods are used to evaluate specific estimates of these tensors, and
  the overall stiffness of multiphase media is discussed.
