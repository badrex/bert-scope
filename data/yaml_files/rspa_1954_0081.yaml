tldr: The authors discuss the distribution of earthquake epicenters in the Atlantic
  and Indian Oceans, focusing on the mid-Atlantic Ridge and the central ridge of the
  Indian Ocean. They argue that these two ridges are related structures, and provide
  examples of seismic activity in these regions.
