tldr: This article reviews recent progress and future prospects in diagnosing energetic
  electrons and ions in solar flares. It discusses the roles these particles play
  in the flare as a whole, focusing on hard-ray and gamma-ray emission data and thermal
  plasma data. The article also explores the acceleration and transport of these particles,
  as well as their potential impact on space and equipment.
