tldr: The author compared the properties of amyl-compounds derived from petroleum
  and fusel-oil. They found that the boiling points of the same compounds agreed perfectly,
  and the specific gravities showed only small differences, with those from petroleum
  being slightly higher. This study concluded that the amyl-compounds from both sources
  are identical.
