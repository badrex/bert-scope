tldr: The article discusses the genetic framework for the ethylene response pathway
  in Arabidopsis seedlings. The authors identify eight mutant loci that have an ethylene-insensitive
  phenotype and analyze their epistatic interactions. They propose a model for the
  genetic pathway of ethylene signal transduction, which includes the roles of ETR1,
  EIN4, and CTR1 genes in controlling seedling stress response to ethylene.
