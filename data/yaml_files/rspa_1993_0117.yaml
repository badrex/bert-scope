tldr: This article explores the self-oscillatory modes of fatigue fracture and the
  formation of self-similar structures at the fracture surface. The authors discuss
  the existence of discontinuities in the fatigue fracture kinetic diagrams and the
  appearance of an intermediate asymptotic self-similar regime during crack propagation.
  They propose a model to explain these phenomena and highlight the importance of
  understanding these processes for future research.
