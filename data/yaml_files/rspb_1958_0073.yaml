tldr: The authors discuss the role of the pituitary gland in maintaining lactation
  and the effects of hormone replacement therapy on milk secretion. They also explore
  the use of pituitary grafts to maintain mammary function in hypophysectomized rats.
  The study highlights the importance of prolactin, adrenocorticotropin (ACTH), and
  possibly growth hormone (GH) in lactation maintenance.
