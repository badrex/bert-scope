tldr: The authors conducted a study on the presence of biochemical reactions in various
  types of muscle tissues, including electrical organs of rays, striated jaw muscles
  of echinoids, and smooth muscles of holo-thurians. They found that these tissues
  share similar systems, such as the phosphagen and adenylpyrophosphate, which play
  a crucial role in muscle function. This research has significant implications for
  understanding the evolution and distribution of phosphagens in different organisms.
