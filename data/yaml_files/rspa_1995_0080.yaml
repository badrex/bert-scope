tldr: The authors present a model to quantify the ignition hazard associated with
  optical fiber technology in flammable atmospheres. They study the effects of various
  parameters, such as mixture composition, optical beam diameter, and physical properties
  of the absorption and heat transfer processes. The model helps predict critical
  conditions for ignition and provides insights into the safety of using optical fibers
  in hazardous environments.
