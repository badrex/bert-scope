tldr: This study investigates the heat transfer characteristics of water in rotational
  motion between horizontal concentric cylinders, considering primary fluid motion
  due to the rotation of the inner cylinders alone and due to the rotation of the
  inner cylinder with reverse flow caused by a divider. The results are correlated
  by a parameter related to the generalized stability parameter, and radial temperature
  profiles are provided to indicate flow patterns. The findings show that below a
  certain Taylor number, the Nusselt number is constant and equal to the theoretical
  value for conduction, while at a certain critical Taylor number, the Nusselt number
  increases with increasing Taylor number.
