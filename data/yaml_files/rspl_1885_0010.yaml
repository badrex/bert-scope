tldr: The author, James Hector, describes his observations of the total solar eclipse
  of September 9, 1885, focusing on the scarlet prominences and the corona. He reports
  on the irregular outline of the corona and the large expansion reaching nearly two
  diameters from the sun's limb. The author also mentions the intense flashes of light
  observed at the beginning and end of totality, which he compares to electric lights.
