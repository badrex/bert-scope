tldr: The author conducted experiments on the gallbladder of frogs and discovered
  large electrical variations that occur regularly even 24 hours post mortem. The
  gallbladder consistently exhibited an "antidrome blaze" or response to excitation,
  which is a type of electrical response. The author also tested the effects of various
  treatments on the gallbladder's responses, such as boiling or exposure to chloroform
  vapour.
