tldr: This article discusses the factors affecting the efficiency of animal farming
  and the components of efficiency, such as reproductive index, productive efficiency,
  and carcass composition. It evaluates the efficiency of various animal species and
  systems, considering their feed conversion rates, lifetime productivity, and adaptability
  to available resources. The author suggests that a reduction in the importation
  of feeding stuffs and a decline in the contribution of animal foods to the human
  diet may be necessary for long-term food policy planning.
