tldr: The authors conducted a study on the prevalence of trypanosomes in wild animals
  living in the sleeping-sickness area of Nyasaland. They found that 31.7% of the
  animals tested positive for pathogenic trypanosomes, with the most common species
  being Trypanosoma brucei vel rhodesiense. The authors recommend controlling the
  population of these wild animals in the fly-infested areas to prevent the spread
  of the disease to humans and domestic animals.
