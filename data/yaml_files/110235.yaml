tldr: The author, Henry Kater, discovered an error in standards of linear measure
  arising from the thickness of the bar on which they were traced. He conducted experiments
  and devised a method to correct this error, which involved using a piano-wire to
  detect surface irregularities and constructing a scale to minimize the error. This
  method could be applied to various useful purposes when a straight edge was required.
