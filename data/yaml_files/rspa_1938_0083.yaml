tldr: This article investigates the development and characteristics of spark discharges
  using a rotating camera and an impulse-voltage generator. The authors discovered
  that spark discharges consist of two or more components, similar to a lightning
  flash. They studied the leader and main strokes of the spark discharge and found
  that the main stroke has a higher propagation velocity than the leader stroke. The
  authors also observed differences in discharge behavior when changing the polarity
  of the high-voltage electrode.
