tldr: The authors conducted an electron microscope study on elastic tissue from various
  human and animal sources. They developed a method to isolate elastic tissue and
  examined it in thin sections. The study found that elastic tissue is composed of
  homogeneous, low-density material with no longitudinal or cross-striations. The
  tissue's structure and composition were confirmed through wide-angle X-ray diffraction,
  which showed distinct patterns different from collagen. The elastic tissue forms
  networks of branching and anastomosing fibers, which can be loose or dense depending
  on the tissue type.
