tldr: The authors develop a statistical mechanical approach to study regular assemblies,
  a class of cooperative assemblies with specific properties. They construct the grand
  partition function and derive expressions for average properties, such as the fraction
  of sites occupied and the probability of a given site being occupied. They also
  introduce quasi-chemical equilibrium relations to analyze the problem and determine
  the free energy of the assembly.
