tldr: The author investigates the motor roots of the brachial plexus and discovers
  that the second dorsal root is responsible for controlling the intrinsic muscles
  of the hand. Additionally, the author finds that the dilator nerve of the iris comes
  from the anterior root of the second dorsal nerve in both monkeys and humans.
