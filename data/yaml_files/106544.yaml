tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the cold produced by the evaporation
  of various fluids, focusing on ether's exceptional ability to generate a significant
  degree of cold. They developed a method to use the least amount of ether to freeze
  water and observed that the cold produced by ether evaporation was greater than
  other volatile fluids. The author also discovered that water freezes more easily
  in winter than in summer, requiring less cold.
