tldr: The authors discuss the limitations of traditional methods for estimating agonist
  affinity and propose a new model that accounts for distributed receptor states.
  They apply this model to experimental data involving 5-hydroxytryptamine and phenoxybenzamine
  on aortic tissue, demonstrating the potential for overestimation of agonist affinities
  when using irreversible receptor antagonism. The implications for pharmacologists
  and medicinal chemists are discussed.
