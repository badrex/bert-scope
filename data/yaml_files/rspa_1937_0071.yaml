tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the rate of emission of beta-ray
  energy by radium B and C, and thorium B and C. They used ionization chambers to
  measure the ionization produced by the beta radiation in various media. The results
  showed that the rate of emission of beta-ray energy by radium B and C, and thorium
  B and C, was consistent with the distance from the source.
