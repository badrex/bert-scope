tldr: The study investigates the inward current generated by Na-Ca exchange during
  the action potential in single atrial cells of the rabbit. The researchers used
  the whole-cell patch-clamp technique to record the inward current during repolarizations
  following a brief depolarizing pulse. The results suggest that the inward current
  contributes to the generation of the late plateau phase of the rabbit atrial action
  potential and is activated by intracellular calcium released from the sarcoplasmic
  reticulum.
