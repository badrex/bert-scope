tldr: This article discusses the measurement and interpretation of changes in strain
  in rocks, focusing on patterns and magnitudes of natural strain in various tectonic
  environments. The author presents five different geological structures and their
  associated strain values, demonstrating the wide range of deformation modes and
  strain magnitudes. The study aims to provide insights into the origin and formation
  of major geological structures by understanding the processes and mechanisms of
  natural crustal deformation.
