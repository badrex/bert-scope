tldr: This article presents an experimental study of the de Haas-van Alphen effect
  in aluminum. The authors measure the torque on a crystal of aluminum in a uniform
  magnetic field and analyze the resulting oscillations to determine the periods of
  the high-frequency oscillations. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties
  and behavior of aluminum and contributes to the understanding of the de Haas-van
  Alphen effect in metals.
