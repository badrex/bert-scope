tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the shot voltage in thermionic
  valves and extended Schottky's formula to include valves with space charge limitations.
  They found that the shot voltage can be used to examine secondary emission in valves,
  which occurs when the anode potential is less than the screen potential. This paper
  describes how the apparent magnitude of the secondary stream was determined for
  two types of small receiving valves, revealing some other effects that may be due
  to ionization.
