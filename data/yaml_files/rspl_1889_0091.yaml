tldr: The author examines volcanic ash from the 1886 eruption of Tunguragua in Ecuador
  and discovers the presence of silver in the ash. This is the second known case of
  silver being found in volcanic dust, with the first case being from the 1885 eruption
  of Cotopaxi. The author discusses the possible sources of the silver and its implications
  for the understanding of volcanic eruptions and the distribution of minerals in
  the Andes.
