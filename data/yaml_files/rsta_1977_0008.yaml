tldr: The authors conducted experiments using a pulse time-of-flight technique to
  measure the drag experienced by negative ions moving through liquid 4He. Their results
  support Landau's theory of superfluidity and demonstrate the inapplicability of
  other theories of supercritical dissipation. The findings are in excellent agreement
  with Bowley and Sheard's incoherent two-roton theory, allowing for the derivation
  of a numerical value for the matrix element characterizing two-roton emission.
