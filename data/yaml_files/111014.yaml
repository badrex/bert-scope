tldr: The author, W. R. Grove, conducted experiments to understand the effect of surrounding
  media on voltaic ignition. He found that the heat generated in a platinum wire immersed
  in hydrogen and its compounds was less than in other gases. The cooling effect of
  hydrogen was nearly equal to that of water. The author concluded that these cooling
  effects were due to some molecular character of the gases, not dependent on specific
  gravity, specific heat, or conducting power for electricity.
