tldr: The authors successfully prepared and trapped phenyl radicals in various solid
  matrices using chemical reactions at low temperatures. They observed the electron
  spin resonance (ESR) spectrum of the phenyl radical in different matrices, including
  water, benzene, and perfluorocyclohexane. The ESR spectrum of the phenyl radical
  consists of nine hyperfine lines, which provide insights into the nature of the
  orbital occupied by the unpaired electron and the reasons for the high reactivity
  of the phenyl radical.
