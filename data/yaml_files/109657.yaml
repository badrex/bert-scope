tldr: This article discusses the condition of cretinism, a rare developmental disorder
  characterized by intellectual disability and physical abnormalities. The author,
  Henry Reeve, examines the possible connections between cretinism and goitre, and
  suggests that the disorder may be caused by physical factors in certain districts.
  He also highlights the importance of prevention through improving living conditions
  and moving children to healthier environments. The analogy between cretinism and
  rickets is also mentioned.
