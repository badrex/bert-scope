tldr: The author, Dr. Andrew Ure, discusses the limitations of previous methods for
  analyzing organic substances and introduces new methods to improve accuracy. He
  uses oxide of copper in a specific humidity and dries organic bodies in a vacuum
  with a surface of sulfuric acid. He also describes a furnace and other implements
  for decomposition and examines the results of his analyses, including the composition
  of sulfuric ether and diabetic sugar.
