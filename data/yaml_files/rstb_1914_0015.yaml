tldr: The author investigates the chromaffine system in annelids and its relationship
  to the contractile vascular system. They find that a chromaffine system, consisting
  of cells that take a yellow stain with chrome salts, is present in almost all members
  of the vertebrate kingdom. The presence of this reaction is coincident with, and
  probably dependent upon, the secretion by these cells of the substance adrenaline.
  The author also discusses the possible functions and distribution of the chromaffine
  system in various groups of animals, and its possible relationship to the sympathetic
  nervous system.
