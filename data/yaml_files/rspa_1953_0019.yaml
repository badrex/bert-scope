tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine the energy values of various
  proton and deuteron reactions with isotopes such as 6Li, 7Li, 9Be, nB, and 15N.
  They studied the reactions using a magnetic spectrometer and provided precise measurements
  of reaction energies. The results were compared with other research groups, revealing
  slight discrepancies due to differences in standards used. The study focused on
  reactions involving beryllium isotopes, providing insights into nuclear physics
  and energy cycles.
