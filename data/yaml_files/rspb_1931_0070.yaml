tldr: This study investigates the relationship between interfacial tension and hydrogen-ion
  concentration in living cells. The researchers found that fatty substances in cell
  interfaces can withstand varying H-ion concentrations without tearing the cell apart.
  They also discovered that living cells can buffer against changes in interfacial
  tension, which may play a role in muscle contraction and the response of certain
  cells in the central nervous system to pH changes.
