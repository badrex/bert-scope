tldr: The author describes a unique case of a woman with a malformation in her uterine
  system, where one side of the womb, fallopian tube, and ovarium were underdeveloped.
  This case challenges previous theories about the cause of procreating male and female
  offspring. The author also discusses the existence of separate placentas in cases
  of twins and the process of generation.
