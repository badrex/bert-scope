tldr: This article investigates the variations of electromotive force between metals
  at high temperatures in fused salts. The author, Thomas Andrews, examines the effects
  of temperature on the electrochemical positions of metals like platinum and copper
  in various fused salts. The study reveals that temperature differences between metals
  can cause significant deviations from the normal electrochemical positions, and
  that a point of temperature exists where thermal effects counterbalance the normal
  electric action of the fused salt.
