tldr: The article discusses the use of low temperature circular dichroism (CD) as
  a powerful tool for determining the geometry of molecules in solution. It explores
  how changes in temperature can affect CD measurements and how this can be applied
  to conformational analysis. The article also provides examples of different molecules
  and their CD behavior under various temperature conditions.
