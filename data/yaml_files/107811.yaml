tldr: The author, Samuel Hunter Christie, conducted experiments to study the magnetic
  influence in solar rays and its effect on a magnetized needle. He discovered that
  the solar rays have sensible magnetic properties that can be observed in the vibrations
  of a magnetized needle, independently of the heat they impart. The author also found
  that an increase in temperature causes a decrease in the intensity of the needle,
  and that the capacity of brass for developing magnetism by induction is diminished
  by an increase in temperature.
