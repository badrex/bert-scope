tldr: The author conducted experiments comparing the light output of Cassegrainian
  and Gregorian telescopes. They found that the Cassegrainian telescope had a higher
  light output, which is important for better visibility and clarity in astronomical
  observations. The author also discussed the possible reasons for the difference
  in light output between the two telescope types.
