tldr: The authors studied the absorption spectrum of Cs I vapor and observed structure
  in the photoionization continuum. The experimental results showed discrepancies
  between the independent particle model predictions and the observed data, indicating
  the importance of electron-electron correlation processes. The findings confirm
  similar discrepancies reported for Xe I and suggest that continuous absorption beyond
  the edges remains significant at energies several hundreds of electron volts above
  the thresholds.
