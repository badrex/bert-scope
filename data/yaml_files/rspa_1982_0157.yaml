tldr: The authors study Leech roots, which are fundamental roots for the even unimodular
  lattice in Lorentzian space. They provide a table of Leech roots in both Euclidean
  and hyperbolic coordinates and explain how these roots simplify and explain the
  results of Vinberg and Inskaia on reflexion groups of unimodular Lorentzian lattices
  in dimensions below 20.
