tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate the variation of local heat
  by placing thermometers at different heights and locations. They found that the
  cold of the night at the lowest station often exceeded the cold at higher stations,
  and this variation was influenced by the state of the atmosphere, particularly the
  clearness or cloudiness of the sky. The author also observed that when the sky was
  clear, the cold seemed to arise from the earth and was found in the greatest degree
  in the lowest situation.
