tldr: This study investigates the reproductive development and self-fertilization
  in three isofemale lines of the hermaphroditic freshwater snail Physa. The researchers
  found that the snails' age and size at reproductive maturity varied between the
  lines, with male maturity reached at a mean of 5.7 weeks and female maturity at
  7.3 weeks. The first production of viable offspring by self-fertilization occurred
  at a mean age of 22 weeks, with a significant difference in size at reproduction
  among the lines. The research also identified cases of outeross male-sterility,
  outeross female-sterility, and outeross double-sterility, suggesting that simultaneous
  hermaphroditism best describes the reproductive biology of these snails.
