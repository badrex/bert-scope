tldr: This article discusses the neural mechanisms of classical conditioning in mammals,
  focusing on the roles of the hippocampus and cerebellum. The hippocampus is involved
  in forming memory traces and long-term potentiation, while the cerebellum and its
  associated brain-stem circuitry are essential for learning and memory of conditioned
  responses. The author presents evidence supporting the idea that mossy fibers convey
  conditioned stimulus information, and climbing fibers convey the critical reinforcement
  information to the cerebellum.
