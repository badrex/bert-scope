tldr: The authors studied the metabolism of sea urchin eggs during the fertilization
  reaction. They found that there is a sudden evolution of gas during fertilization,
  mainly derived from bicarbonate in the sea water. The consumption rate of the eggs
  increases upon fertilization, and the authors developed a special technique to measure
  the respiratory quotient at very short time intervals to better understand the metabolism
  during this process.
