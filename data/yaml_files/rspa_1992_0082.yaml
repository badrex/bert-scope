tldr: The article investigates the ionic transport and compaction of clay filtercakes
  using electrical double layer theory. It models the process of filtration and predicts
  the forces between clay particles and the ionic content of the filtrate. The study
  also considers the time-dependent motion of ions within the cake and provides numerical
  results to support the findings.
