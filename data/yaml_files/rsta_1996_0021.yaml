tldr: The paper presents a mathematical approach to determine the structural and hydroelastic
  behavior of submerged vertical slender steel structures operating at low tension.
  The study evaluates the buckling behavior at low tension by retaining nonlinear
  curvature terms and using an expansion in series to reduce the governing equation
  to a set of linear ordinary differential equations, which are then solved sequentially
  by employing Galerkin's technique. This approach is also extended to lateral oscillation
  of the structure when excited by forced horizontal oscillatory motions at the top
  end.
