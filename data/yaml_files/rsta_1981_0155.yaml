tldr: This erratum corrects the phase shifts of reflected waves in the Reissner-Nordström
  black hole perturbation study. The error occurred during table compilation, but
  the other results and conclusions remain unaffected. The corrected phase shifts
  do not alter the conversion coefficients or figures.
