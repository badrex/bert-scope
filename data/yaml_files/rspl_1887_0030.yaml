tldr: The author investigated the cause of scarlet fever and discovered a specific
  micrococcus in the blood of patients and cows. They successfully isolated and cultivated
  the micrococcus, and then tested its effects on animals, finding that it caused
  the same symptoms as human scarlatina. This research provided strong evidence linking
  the micrococcus to scarlet fever.
