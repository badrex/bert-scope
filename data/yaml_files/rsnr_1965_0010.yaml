tldr: This article explores Isaac Newton's early life and scientific pursuits, focusing
  on his development as a scientist and his groundbreaking experiments in optics.
  Newton's experiments with prisms led to the discovery that white light is made up
  of different colors, each with its own refrangibility. This discovery challenged
  the prevailing theories of the time and marked the beginning of a new era in the
  study of light and color.
