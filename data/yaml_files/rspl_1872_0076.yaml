tldr: This article explores the dynamics of rigid bodies using screw theory, a mathematical
  framework for studying the motion and force of rigid bodies. The author discusses
  the energy required to twist a body, the concept of virtual coefficients, and the
  use of coreciprocal screws. The article also covers the sexiant function, the relationship
  between impulsive and instantaneous screws, and the determination of principal screws
  of kinetic energy. The author applies these principles to various scenarios, including
  two and three degrees of freedom.
