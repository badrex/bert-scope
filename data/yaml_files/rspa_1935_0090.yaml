tldr: The authors present a general theory of optical activity using a system of coupled
  isotropic oscillators. They focus on molecules with a binary axis of symmetry and
  discuss the limitations of the theory. The study aims to find practical formulas
  for optical rotation and dispersion, which can be used to understand the behavior
  of molecules and their interactions with light.
