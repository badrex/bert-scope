tldr: This article presents an alternative proof of the local observability criterion
  for invariant systems on Lie groups and coset spaces using classical observability
  methods, such as the observability codistribution. The proof shows that the criterion
  is a special case of a more general approach to the observability problem, expanding
  the application field of classical analysis.
