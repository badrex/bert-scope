tldr: The author derives a meridional velocity equation, which is an inhomogeneous
  form of the spheroidal wave equation, to solve the frictionless Laplace's tidal
  equations for long-period zonal tides in a constant-depth global ocean. The solution
  is obtained by expanding the meridional velocity in associated Legendre functions,
  providing additional information on the structure of the tidal equations and allowing
  for simpler recurrence relations for the solution coefficients.
