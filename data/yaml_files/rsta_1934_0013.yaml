tldr: Researchers discovered two types of diamonds, one being transparent in certain
  regions of the infra-red and ultra-violet, and possessing unique properties such
  as photo-conductive effect, laminar structure, and isotropy. The findings provide
  a better understanding of the differences between the two types of diamonds and
  their crystallographic peculiarities.
