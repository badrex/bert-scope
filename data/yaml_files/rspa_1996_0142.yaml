tldr: The article presents a systematic formula for the asymptotic expansion of a
  general integral with respect to a small, positive parameter. The method uses integration
  in the finite part sense of Hadamard and applies to a wide range of complex functions
  and real functions. The results have various applications in mathematics, physics,
  and engineering.
