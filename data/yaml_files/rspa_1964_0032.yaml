tldr: The authors studied the dielectric constants and heats of mixing in associated
  solutions, specifically piperidine/tetrahydropyran, piperidine/cyclohexane, and
  tetrahydropyran/cyclohexane. They found that all three systems are associated and
  have endothermic heats of mixing, suggesting that N-H hydrogen bonds are involved.
  The authors also provided evidence of hydrogen bond formation using nuclear magnetic
  resonance spectra.
