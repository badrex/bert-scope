tldr: The study examines the potential of axons within the ascending dorsal column
  projection of lumbar dorsal root ganglion cells to grow through the thoracic spinal
  cord that has been cut at various stages of development in anuran tadpoles. The
  results show that cord transection is followed by restoration of the ascending dorsal
  column in a stage-dependent manner. This research provides insights into the restoration
  of axon pathways in the central nervous system of amphibians and other vertebrates.
