tldr: The authors examine the structure and behavior of surface films made from various
  sterols and their derivatives. They find that different substituents in the complex
  ring system of cholesterol significantly affect the behavior of the molecules on
  water surfaces. The results show that the position and number of double bonds, as
  well as the presence of the hydroxyl group, do not impact the packing of the molecules
  and the structure of the films. However, the position of the hydroxyl group plays
  a crucial role in determining the film's stability and compressibility.
