tldr: This article discusses the challenges of managing residual elements in steel
  production, such as copper, tin, and nickel, which can cause hot shortness during
  processing. The authors propose strategies to control these elements, including
  producing low-residual casts, increasing nickel content, reducing scaling rates,
  and minimizing holding times at high temperatures. They also present a revised mathematical
  model to predict and quantify the degree of enrichment under various reheating conditions.
