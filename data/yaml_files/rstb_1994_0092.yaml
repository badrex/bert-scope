tldr: This article discusses practical approaches to estimating species richness and
  measuring biodiversity in speciose groups. It emphasizes the importance of using
  simple ratios and hands-on knowledge of the groups in question to extrapolate patterns
  and make reliable estimates. The article also highlights the need for appropriate
  rigor in assembling species datasets, including accurate species recognition and
  sorting. The focus is on terrestrial free-living metazoans, with examples drawn
  largely from work on Coleoptera.
