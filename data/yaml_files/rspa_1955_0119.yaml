revised_title: Heat Conductivity of Superconductors Below 1 Degree Kelvin
scientific_discipline: Physics > Solid State Physics
semantic_tags:
- Superconductivity
- Heat conductivity
- Low-temperature physics
- Thermal conductivity
- Dielectric materials
tldr: The authors developed a method for accurately measuring thermal conductivity
  in the temperature region below 1K and used it to determine the heat conductivity
  of various superconducting materials. They found that superconducting metals behave
  similarly to dielectric materials in their heat transport at very low temperatures.
