tldr: The authors investigate the formation, reaction, and deactivation of the excited
  state of molecular oxygen (O2(a1Δg)) using a flow technique. They study the reaction
  with ozone and quenching by other molecules, providing rate constants and an estimate
  of wall deactivation efficiency. The results are compared with previous studies
  and used to calculate the rate constant for the energy-pooling reaction.
