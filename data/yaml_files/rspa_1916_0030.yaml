tldr: The author presents a hypothesis on molecular configuration in three dimensions,
  suggesting that the path of valency electrons around an atom is a smaller circle
  parallel to an equatorial plane. This hypothesis explains the difference between
  electro-negative and electro-positive atoms and provides a model for understanding
  chemical bonding and molecular structure.
