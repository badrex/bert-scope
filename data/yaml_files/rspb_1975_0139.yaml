tldr: This study examines the role of visual function in the development and modification
  of intertectal neuronal connexions in Xenopus laevis. The researchers found that
  while normal animals deprived of binocular visual experience still developed a pattern
  of intertectal connexions that approximated the normal pattern, visual experience
  may play a role in refining the organization of these connexions. The results suggest
  that visual function is necessary for the reorganization of intertectal connexions
  that occurs after larval eye rotation.
