tldr: The author conducted experiments on the spectra of various carbon compounds
  and found a relationship between the temperature and the resulting spectra. They
  observed that the blue line and flutings in the spectra correspond to different
  temperature levels, with the blue line representing the highest temperature and
  the blue flutings the lowest. This discovery helped in understanding the molecular
  grouping of carbon compounds.
