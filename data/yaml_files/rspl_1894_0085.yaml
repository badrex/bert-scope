tldr: The authors investigated the propagation of magnetisation in iron and its relation
  to electric currents. They found that the time it takes for magnetisation to reverse
  is affected by the induced currents in the iron. This study has implications for
  the design of transformers and dynamo machines. Additionally, the authors discussed
  the variation of atmospheric temperature throughout the day and methods for observing
  these changes.
