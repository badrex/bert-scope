tldr: This article investigates the polarization of scattered light for lunar samples
  from various space missions. The authors found that the degree of polarization depends
  on the surface properties, such as albedo and texture. This information can now
  be applied to determine albedos and surface textures for objects like asteroids
  and planetary satellites, for which no samples are available but for which some
  polarization measurements have been made.
