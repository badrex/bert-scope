tldr: This article investigates the lubrication of rollers under varying loads and
  speeds. It examines the flow of oil between the rollers and the factors affecting
  the film thickness. The study finds that the film thickness decreases with increasing
  load and speed, and the oil film thickness at low loads is less than predicted by
  previous theories. The effective viscosity of the oil is also found to be lower
  than the inlet oil viscosity, possibly due to frictional heating.
