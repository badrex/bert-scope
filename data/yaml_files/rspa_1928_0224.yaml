tldr: The author presents a solution for the exact distribution of the multiple correlation
  coefficient, which is a crucial statistic in understanding the relationship between
  multiple variables. This distribution is part of a larger system of distributions
  that underlie the analysis of variance and is essential for statistical inference
  and testing.
