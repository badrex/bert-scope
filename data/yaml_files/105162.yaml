tldr: In 1753, William Shervington observed the transit of Mercury over the Sun on
  May 6 from the Island of Antigua. He used a Graham's watch and an exquisite quadrant
  to record the event. His observation was communicated by Peter Collinson to Benjamin
  Franklin. Shervington's observation was compared to that made by Mr. Short in Surrey
  Street, furthering the understanding of planetary transits and early modern astronomy.
