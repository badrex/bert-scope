tldr: This article describes the early development of the pericardium, diaphragm,
  and great veins in rabbit embryos. It traces the splanchnic origin of the heart,
  the formation of the mesocardium, and the course of the omphalomesenteric veins
  to the heart. The development of a septum, the septum transversum, and the formation
  of the ventral diaphragm between the liver and the heart are also discussed. The
  article also covers the appearance of other somatic veins, the infolding of the
  somatopleure and splanchnopleure, and the development of the umbilical veins and
  placenta.
