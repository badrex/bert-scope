tldr: The authors study thermally driven flows in tall rectangular cavities filled
  with a fluid-saturated porous medium. They analyze the flow structure, focusing
  on the large aspect ratio limit where nonlinear convective flow occurs near each
  end of the cavity. The study provides predictions of heat transfer across the cavity
  and compares them with the results of full numerical simulations.
