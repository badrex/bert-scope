tldr: The authors study magnetohydrodynamic wave propagation from a localized source,
  including the Hall effect. They examine conditions where the wave frequency is of
  the same order as the ion cyclotron frequency and investigate how the wave amplitude
  depends on the direction of propagation and the ratio of the wave frequency to the
  ion cyclotron frequency. The results are applicable to laboratory plasmas and certain
  natural plasmas, such as the ionosphere and the upper regions of the Sun's atmosphere.
