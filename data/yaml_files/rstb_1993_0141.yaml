tldr: This study investigates the evolutionary relationships among serpins, a group
  of widely distributed serine proteinase inhibitors found in plants, birds, mammals,
  and viruses. The author aligns amino acid sequences and uses a combination of automatic
  algorithms and structural elements to analyze the serpin family. The results suggest
  that there is as much diversity between plant and mammalian serpins as there is
  among mammalian serpins, and provide evidence for the constrained architecture of
  serpin molecules.
