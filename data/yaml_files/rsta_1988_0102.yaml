tldr: Researchers have developed a new method for synthesizing chiral, optically active
  amino acids using photochemical reactions of chromium carbene complexes. The process
  involves the reaction of chromium carbene complexes with imines to produce lactams,
  which can then be cleaved to form natural and unnatural amino acids. This method
  offers high diastereoselectivity and has potential for future applications in organic
  synthesis.
