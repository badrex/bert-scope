tldr: This article discusses the advancements and applications of high-resolution
  electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS) in studying surface chemistry and vibrational
  spectroscopy. EELS offers high sensitivity and a wide spectral range, allowing for
  the observation of more vibrational modes than optical methods. The article highlights
  various techniques and their limitations, as well as the importance of understanding
  coverage-dependent frequency shifts and dipole coupling for proper interpretation
  of transmission spectra from supported catalysts.
