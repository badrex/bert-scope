tldr: The authors discovered that frog slow muscle fibres, which are normally incapable
  of generating action potentials, can acquire this ability after being paralyzed
  by α-bungarotoxin. This suggests that non-quantal acetylcholine leaking from nerve
  terminals may repress the action potential mechanism in slow muscle fibres.
