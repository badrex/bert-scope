tldr: The Viking satellite observed the global distribution of magnetosphere-ionosphere
  interactions, auroral morphology, and substorm dynamics during solar minimum conditions.
  The satellite's imaging experiment provided new insights into the dayside aurora,
  revealing the importance of the dayside oval for magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions.
  The electric field and low-frequency plasma wave experiments on Viking also demonstrated
  the frequent occurrence of very low-frequency fluctuations of large amplitudes in
  the electric field, which are likely electrostatic and play a significant role in
  the magnetosphere-ionosphere interaction.
