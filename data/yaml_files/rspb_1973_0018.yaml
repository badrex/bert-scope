tldr: This study examines genetic variation in the butterfly species Maniola jurtina
  on the Isles of Scilly. The researchers found that larger islands have more homogeneous
  gene frequencies, while smaller islands show greater variation. The patterns of
  genetic variation are compared to the butterfly's spot distributions, suggesting
  that natural selection plays a significant role in shaping these populations.
