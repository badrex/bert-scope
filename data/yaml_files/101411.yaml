tldr: This article contains various letters discussing the observations and theories
  about comets, including the late and a new comet. One letter highlights the agreement
  between the author's and Monsieur Auzont's thoughts on the comet's motion and the
  use of tables for predicting its path. The author also mentions finding the principle
  of Auzont's ephemerides, which he previously did not disclose.
