tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the weight gain in water when it is
  converted into ice. They found that water gains weight when it freezes, which may
  be due to an increase in the attraction of gravitation or the absorption of a substance
  through the glass container. The author also proposed a pendulum experiment to further
  investigate the cause of the weight gain.
