tldr: The study investigates honeybees' scent perception and its role in foraging
  activities. The researchers discovered that honeybees can perceive and distinguish
  between different scents, even in very low concentrations. The bees' own body scent
  may help them identify comrades and enemies during foraging. Amputating the antennae
  of honeybees significantly impairs their scent perception. The findings contribute
  to understanding the complex communication and navigation systems of honeybees.
