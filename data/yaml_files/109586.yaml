tldr: The author, Charles Hatchett, examines the magnetical pyrites and other sulfurets
  of iron, focusing on their chemical composition and properties. He discovers that
  the magnetical pyrites are composed of sulfur and iron in specific proportions and
  that these properties are different from those of common martial pyrites. Hatchett
  also discusses the relationship between the magnetic properties of these substances
  and their chemical composition, as well as the potential applications of these findings
  in creating stronger artificial magnets.
