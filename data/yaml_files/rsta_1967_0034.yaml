tldr: 'This paper discusses the data and orbit analysis activities at The Johns Hopkins
  University Applied Physics Laboratory in support of the U.S. Navy satellite Doppler
  system, Tranet. The authors focus on two topics closely related to geodetic research:
  editing and archiving of Doppler data and generating accurate satellite orbit parameters
  and ephemerides. They describe the methods used to analyze the data, including the
  editing process and the generation of accurate satellite trajectories.'
