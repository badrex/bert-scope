tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effect of oxygen supply and concentration
  on the corrosion of zinc in potassium chloride solutions. They found that the corrosion
  rates of zinc and mild steel varied with the conditions, and the difference between
  them increased with time. The results showed that the corrosion rates were not solely
  controlled by the rate of oxygen supply to restricted cathodic areas, and that the
  effect of changing the atmosphere on corrosion rates was not yet fully understood.
