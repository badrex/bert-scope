tldr: The author conducted experiments with a silicon arc in a nitrogen atmosphere
  to study its spectrum. They discovered new lines in the silicon arc spectrum and
  analyzed them using the theory of Heisenberg and Hund. The findings expanded the
  understanding of the ionization stages of the silicon atom and provided valuable
  data for the classification of atomic energy levels.
