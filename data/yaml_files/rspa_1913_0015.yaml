tldr: The authors explore the relationship between ionic size, atomic volume, and
  the heats of formation of solid, liquid, and ionic molecules. They propose a new
  empirical law that relates the ionic volumes to the reciprocals of the effective
  atomic volumes and the change in atomic volume produced by the combination. This
  law helps explain the heats of formation of compounds and the internal energy of
  atoms.
