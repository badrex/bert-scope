tldr: The author, Anthony Van Leeuwenhoek, examines the structure and development
  of various seeds and embryo plants. He observes the different parts of seeds, such
  as the root, stem, and leaves, and describes the process of plant growth. Leeuwenhoek
  also discusses the role of ligaments and membranes in nourishing the embryo plant
  and the importance of the environment for successful growth.
