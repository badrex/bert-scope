tldr: The author investigates the figure a fluid would assume when acted upon by attraction
  and centrifugal force. They use mathematical calculations to determine the Earth's
  shape and develop a method to solve the problem for various types of spheroids.
  This method simplifies the analysis and provides a more complete theory.
