tldr: The author investigates the tracks of X-rays and beta-rays using a cloud chamber,
  discovering the number and distribution of ions along the path of a particle. The
  study confirms the theory introduced by Sir J.J. Thomson and developed by Bohr and
  others, providing insights into the ionization and energy loss of particles.
