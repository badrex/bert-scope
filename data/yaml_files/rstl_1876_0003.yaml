tldr: The author presents a detailed analysis of the Earth's magnetic force, focusing
  on observations of dip, declination, and horizontal intensity taken at the Bombay
  Observatory between 1867 and 1874. The study discusses the annual variation, diurnal
  inequality, and probable errors of these measurements, providing valuable insights
  into the Earth's magnetic field.
