tldr: This article discusses the lasting influence of Kolmogorov's 1958 seminar on
  dynamical systems and hydrodynamic instability. It explores his ideas on turbulence,
  the transition from laminar to turbulent flows, and the predictability of turbulent
  chaos. The article also highlights the challenges in distinguishing between quasi-periodic
  systems and genuinely chaotic systems, and the unsolved problems related to the
  study of turbulence and stochastic processes.
