tldr: This article explores the cooling process of andesitic magma as it ascends through
  the Earth's lithosphere. The author considers various cooling models, including
  elastic crack propagation, viscous blobs, and flow up a pipe, to estimate the ascent
  velocity of the magma. The study concludes that heat transfer is predominantly by
  convection and conduction, and that adiabatic ascent is unlikely. The findings have
  implications for understanding volcanic activity and the dynamics of magma beneath
  island arcs.
