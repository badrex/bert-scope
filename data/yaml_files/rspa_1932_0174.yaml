tldr: This article investigates the mobility of alkali ions in various gases, focusing
  on the resolving power of the four-gauze method. The authors analyze factors that
  determine the resolving power and discuss the mobility spectrum of ions in different
  gases. They also explore the effects of ion clustering and the possibility of detecting
  isotopes of lithium using the method. The study provides insights into the behavior
  of alkali ions in gases and the potential for improving the resolving power of ion
  mobility experiments.
