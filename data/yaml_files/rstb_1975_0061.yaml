tldr: The authors investigate the structure, synthesis, and genetic transmission of
  elongated-chain haemoglobin variants, suggesting that a single base substitution
  in the alpha-chain termination codon is the most likely molecular basis for these
  common abnormal haemoglobins. They provide a comprehensive understanding of the
  molecular pathology of the different forms of alpha-thalassaemia, including the
  clinical associations and distribution of these variants.
