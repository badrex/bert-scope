tldr: This article explores how frequency-dependent selection, which is influenced
  by factors such as predator behavior, background complexity, and prey density, affects
  the evolution of animal color patterns. The study focuses on how cryptic and aposematic
  coloration can be maintained or altered based on these factors, and how this selection
  can lead to color pattern polymorphisms in prey species.
