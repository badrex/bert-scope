tldr: This article investigates the nonlinear development of wave growth in a boundary
  layer, leading to chaotic motion and turbulence. The study uses a combination of
  artificial and natural disturbances to excite the flow and measure the amplification
  and propagation of unstable waves. The findings provide insight into the mechanics
  of chaotic motion and the transition to turbulence in open flow geometries, such
  as boundary layers.
