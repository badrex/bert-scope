tldr: The author examines the reproductive organs and fructification of certain Sphaeriaceous
  fungi, revealing a diverse range of forms and structures within the same individual
  plant. This polymorphism has significant implications for the systematic arrangement
  of fungi and the understanding of their reproductive processes. The author presents
  observations on several species, including Sphceria verruceformis and Sphceria favacea,
  and discusses the potential identity of some plants based on their shared growth
  patterns and fructification forms.
