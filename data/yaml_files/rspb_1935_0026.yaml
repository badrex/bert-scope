tldr: The author investigates the controlling factors of photosynthesis, including
  temperature, light intensity, and carbon dioxide concentration. They propose a formula
  to calculate the rate of photosynthesis when a photostationary state is established.
  The study shows that the rate of photosynthesis is directly proportional to light
  intensity and inversely proportional to temperature, providing insights into the
  efficiency of photosynthesis in living plants.
