tldr: This article presents a systematic mathematical study of the equations of motion
  of an aeroplane, focusing on longitudinal and three-dimensional phugoids. The author
  introduces a method of successive approximations to find first approximations for
  various types of aeroplane motions, including Lanchester's phugoids, extended phugoids,
  and three-dimensional phugoids, which give the Immelmann turn. The study aims to
  improve our understanding of aeroplane dynamics and provide a foundation for further
  research in the field.
