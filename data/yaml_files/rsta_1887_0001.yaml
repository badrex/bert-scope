tldr: The author investigates the luni-solar variations of magnetic declination and
  horizontal force at Bombay over a period of 25 years. They found that the majority
  of the phenomenon is a solar diurnal variation that depends on the relative positions
  of the sun and moon. The author developed a formula to express this variation, which
  holds true for each season and magnetic element.
