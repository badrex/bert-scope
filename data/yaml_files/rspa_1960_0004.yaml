  Satellite Motion

tldr: This article explores the motion of satellites in the Earth's gravitational
  field, focusing on the effects on orbital elements and the rotation of the orbital
  plane. The authors develop equations for the variation of these elements and discuss
  the expansion of the gravitational potential. They also examine the rates of rotation
  of the orbital plane due to the Earth's potential and the impact of the ellipticity
  of the equator on this rotation.
