tldr: This study examines the neurosecretory innervation and cell types in the pituitary
  gland of eels at different stages of their life cycle. The research focuses on the
  relationship between Type A and B neurosecretory fibers from the hypothalamus and
  various cell types in the pars distalis. The findings provide insights into the
  control of pituitary function in teleost fishes and the role of neurosecretory fibers
  in regulating the endocrine cells of the eel pituitary.
