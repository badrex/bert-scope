tldr: This article describes a case study of a person who was killed by lightning
  in a chapel in Tottenham-Court-Road. The author, William Henly, provides a detailed
  account of the lightning's effects on the building and the victim. The lightning
  struck a wooden pineapple ornament, melted leadwork, and damaged a clock's mechanism
  before passing through the building. The victim, sitting on a ladder, was struck
  on the left ear and suffered severe burns and wounds. The article highlights the
  importance of proper lightning protection systems in buildings and the need for
  further research on lightning effects.
