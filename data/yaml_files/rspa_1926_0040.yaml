tldr: The authors describe the development of a spectrograph to measure the amount
  of ozone in the Earth's atmosphere and its relation to other geophysical conditions.
  They discuss the variations in ultra-violet light reaching the Earth's surface and
  its connection with atmospheric pressure at great heights. The study contributes
  to understanding the ozone layer and its impact on the environment.
