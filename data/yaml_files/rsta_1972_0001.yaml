tldr: This article discusses a symposium on volcanism and the structure of the Earth,
  focusing on recent advances in understanding the relationship between volcanoes
  and the Earth's crust. The symposium covered topics such as oceanic rocks, island
  arcs, continental margins, and continental volcanicity, with a focus on the impact
  of plate tectonics, geochemical imbalances, sea-floor spreading, and continental
  drift on volcanic geology.
