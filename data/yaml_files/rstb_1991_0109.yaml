tldr: This article explores the dietary evolution of hominoids, focusing on foraging
  strategies and the natural diet of monkeys, apes, and humans. The authors analyze
  morphological, ecological, and behavioral adaptations to understand the shift in
  diet from early Miocene to the present. They conclude that hominoids are mainly
  frugivorous, with adaptations for consuming both hard and soft foods, and that early
  hominids had similar foraging strategies to their ape ancestors.
