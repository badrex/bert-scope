tldr: The authors present an exact large-deflexion analysis of the free vibrations
  of unsupported elliptical plates of lenticular section, considering the influence
  of membrane action and the effects of large deflections. The study focuses on the
  three fundamental modal components, two bending and one twisting, and provides valuable
  insights into the behavior of plates with variable thickness and initial curvature.
  This research is significant for understanding the nonlinear vibrations of structures
  in the field of high-speed aerodynamics and engineering.
