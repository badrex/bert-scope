tldr: This article discusses the evolution and morphological development of reefs
  in the northern Great Barrier Reef, focusing on the impact of sea level changes
  since the last glacial low stand. The authors analyze shallow coring, surface geomorphology,
  lithology, vegetation patterns, and radiometric dating to understand the sequence
  of reef and island development in Holocene time. They also explore the transition
  from vertical to horizontal reef growth and discuss latitudinal variations in reef
  forms along the Great Barrier Reef.
