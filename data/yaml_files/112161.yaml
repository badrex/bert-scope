tldr: This study examines the structure, physiology, and development of Antedon rosaceus,
  a Crinoidea species. The author describes the changes in the skeleton and other
  body parts during the growth and transformation of the organism from a Pentacrinoid
  larva to a mature Antedon. The research provides insights into the life history
  of Crinoidea and helps understand their evolution and fossil records.
