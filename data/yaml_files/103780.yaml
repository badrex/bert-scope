tldr: In 1723, Edmund Halley observed the transit of Mercury passing over the Sun's
  disk. He used a 24-foot telescope and a micrometer to measure the planet's diameter,
  distance from the Sun, and its position in the sky. These observations allowed Halley
  to refine the understanding of Mercury's motion and improve the accuracy of astronomical
  calculations.
