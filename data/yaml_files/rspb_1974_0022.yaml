tldr: The author examines the variations in the reproductive organs of Stellaria media
  and related species, focusing on their relative frequency and prevalent modes of
  pollination. The study reveals the success of Stellaria media, which is predominantly
  self-fertilized, and contrasts it with less widespread and less successful closely
  related species that are frequently cross-fertilized. The author suggests that the
  success of Stellaria media can be attributed to its intrinsic variability, which
  is demonstrated by its polymorphic and polybiotic characteristics.
