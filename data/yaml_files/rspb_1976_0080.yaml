tldr: The article investigates the formation of effective and ineffective root nodules
  in Myrica faya plants when inoculated with endophytes from different Myrica species.
  The symbiotic success of the plants with the normal endophyte and M. cordifolia
  endophyte was observed, while the plants inoculated with the M. gale endophyte formed
  numerous small, ineffective nodules that did not fix nitrogen. The study provides
  insights into the structure and cytology of effective and ineffective nodules, contributing
  to our understanding of non-legume nodule-forming plants and their symbiotic relationships.
