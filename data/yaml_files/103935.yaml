tldr: The Marquis de Caumont describes an extraordinary stone or calculus found in
  a man's bladder after death. The stone's unique shape and structure puzzled the
  scientists of the time, and it raised questions about the formation and extraction
  of such stones. The author hopes for the President of the Royal Society's thoughts
  on this natural phenomenon and its implications for medical practice.
