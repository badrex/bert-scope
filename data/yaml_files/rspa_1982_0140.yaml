tldr: The author investigates the inconsistency of Sudarshan et al.'s generalized
  version of Dirac's positive-energy wave equation when coupled with an external electromagnetic
  field. The study shows that the equation does not remain consistent, contrary to
  the claims made by Sudarshan et al. The findings emphasize the connection between
  the wave equation for the hypothetical particle and the equation for an electron
  in the same field.
