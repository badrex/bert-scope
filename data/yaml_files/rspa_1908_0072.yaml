tldr: The author investigates a luminous glow generated by electrostatic induction
  in an exhausted silica vessel. They discover that silica glow-bulbs produce a more
  intense glow and after-glow compared to glass bulbs, and that the residual gas in
  these bulbs, after exhaustion, is air. The author also explores the generation of
  electricity using silica and its potential applications.
