tldr: The authors develop a method to evaluate the critical temperature of a magnetic
  crystal randomly diluted with non-magnetic atoms. They expand the susceptibility
  in a power series in concentration and extrapolate to find the radius of convergence.
  The method is applied to simple ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic Bravais lattices
  using the Ising and Heisenberg models, and results are compared with other methods
  and experimental data.
