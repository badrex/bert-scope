tldr: The authors developed a dielectric constant method to study the non-stationary
  state in polymerization, using a high-frequency bridge with high sensitivity. They
  measured the dielectric constant changes during the reaction, allowing them to investigate
  the kinetics and radical reactivities in polymerization processes.
