tldr: The author discusses John Hunter's 18th-century experiments on in vitro fertilization
  in Bombyx mori, the silk moth. Hunter claimed success in artificially impregnating
  and hatching moth eggs, but modern attempts to replicate his methods have been unsuccessful.
  The author reflects on the reliability of Hunter's findings and the ongoing challenges
  of in vitro fertilization in various species.
