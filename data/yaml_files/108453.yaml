tldr: This article examines the impact of the River Thames on temperature and fog
  in London. The author compares temperature readings from various locations, including
  the Royal Society, Royal Observatory, and other sites, to understand the influence
  of the river on local climate. The findings suggest that the proximity of the river
  causes higher winter temperatures and lower summer temperatures, contributing to
  the formation of London fogs.
