tldr: This article discusses the status of clinical studies with interferons in cancer
  treatment in the UK in 1982. It covers the evaluation of lymphoblastoid interferon,
  its dose toxicity, and therapeutic responses in various types of cancer. The article
  also highlights ongoing studies with recombinant interferons and the challenges
  faced in determining their efficacy and safety. The results of clinical trials show
  promising responses in some cases, but more research is needed to establish the
  full potential of interferons in cancer treatment.
