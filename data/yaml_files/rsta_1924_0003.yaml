tldr: The author investigates the distribution of the magnetic field and return current
  around a submarine cable carrying alternating current. They use an alternating current
  potentiometer and search coils to measure the magnetic field's intensity and phase,
  and the current density in the water. The research provides a comprehensive understanding
  of the propagation of electromagnetic waves in the sea and the distribution of the
  magnetic field and return current around a submerged cable.
