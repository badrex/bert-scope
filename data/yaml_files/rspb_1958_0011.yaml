tldr: The authors re-examined the fine structure of the walls of vesicles in the green
  alga Valonia using X-ray analysis and electron microscopy. They found that cellulose
  microfibrils are present in three orientations, in separate lamellae. The third
  orientation, previously overlooked, is less abundant due to less frequent lamellae
  and microfibrils being more loosely packed. The authors' model of the wall structure
  differs from the earlier model by Preston and Astbury, but supports their conclusion
  that the cellulose chains run in alternating directions in the lamellae.
