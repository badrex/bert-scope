tldr: The author, Henry Moseley, investigates the uniform flow of a liquid through
  pipes and the factors affecting it. He develops a formula to calculate the discharge
  from a pipe based on the velocity of the central filament and compares it with experiments
  conducted by M. Darcy. The study also explains the retarding effect of filaments,
  such as grass and roots, on stream velocities.
