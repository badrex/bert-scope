tldr: The author, Signor Carlo Matteucci, discusses his electro-physiological research
  on muscle contractions and the electrical phenomena involved. He refers to a recent
  publication by M. DLu Bois Raymond and shares his findings on the similarities between
  induced contractions and galvanoscopic frog contractions. Matteucci explains that
  these contractions produce electrical currents and demonstrate the production of
  an electrical disequilibrium during muscular contraction. He also explores the question
  of whether the cause of the discharge is a phenomenon similar to that of electrical
  fish or a change in the natural conditions of the muscular current.
