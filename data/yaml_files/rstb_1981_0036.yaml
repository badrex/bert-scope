tldr: The article discusses the use of biometrical genetics as a methodology to understand
  the genetic framework of plant breeding. It explains how biometrical genetics allows
  for the analysis of heritable and non-heritable components of variation, and how
  this information can be used to predict the outcome of breeding and selection programs.
  The article also explores the causes of heterosis and the range of phenotypic distributions
  of recombinant inbred lines.
