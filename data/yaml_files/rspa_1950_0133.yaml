tldr: The author presents a general scheme for lattice dynamics without specific assumptions
  about atomic interactions. They clarify the use of this scheme and provide correct
  expressions for elastic constants, emphasizing the importance of the equilibrium
  condition for defining elastic constants. The author also demonstrates the limitations
  of the general scheme and introduces a different technique for discussing problems
  related to stresses and elastic constants.
