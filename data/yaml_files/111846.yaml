tldr: The author, John Tyndall, conducted experiments to further investigate the polarity
  of the diamagnetic force. He used an improved apparatus to test various diamagnetic
  materials, such as bismuth, antimony, and insulators, and found that they all exhibited
  polarity opposed to that of iron. The results supported the existence of the diamagnetic
  force and refuted previous objections and alternative explanations. This research
  helped establish the diamagnetic force as a firmly established truth in science.
