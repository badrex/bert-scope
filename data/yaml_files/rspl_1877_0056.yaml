tldr: The authors, W. J. Russell and Nevil Story Maskelyne, conducted experiments
  to form and study double salts of silver and other nitrates. They discovered that
  double salts can form when the ratio of silver nitrate to potassium nitrate is increased,
  and that the composition of the solution changes depending on the composition of
  the mixture used. They also studied the crystal structure and optical properties
  of these double salts, finding that they belong to the oblique system and have negative
  optical character.
