tldr: The authors studied the lorica construction in the type species of Calliacantha
  Leadbeater, a marine choanoflagellate. They used light and electron microscopy to
  analyze the structure and provide a detailed account of the assembly at the anterior
  end and the variability at the hind end of the lorica. The study helps clarify the
  taxonomy and phyletic interpretation of this species.
