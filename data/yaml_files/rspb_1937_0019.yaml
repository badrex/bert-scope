tldr: The authors investigated the electrical responses in the cochlea and auditory
  tract of a cat when exposed to phase changes in a continuous musical tone. They
  found that the phase change beat was due to the change of phase alone and not any
  other disturbance in amplitude or frequency. This study aimed to shed light on the
  vibrating elements of the internal ear responsible for initiating nervous impulses
  and to compare the response to phase changes in the tract potentials with the cochlear
  potentials to better understand their origin.
