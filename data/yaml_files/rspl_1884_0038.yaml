tldr: The author conducted experiments on the discharge of electricity through gases,
  focusing on mercury vapour. They discovered that the passage of electricity through
  gases involves the breakup of molecules and the formation of unstable compounds
  like ozone. This theory explains the asymmetry of the glow discharge and other phenomena
  in the passage of electricity through gases.
