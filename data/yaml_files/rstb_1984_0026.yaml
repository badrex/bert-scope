tldr: This article discusses the biosynthesis, processing, and transport of storage
  proteins and lectins in the cotyledons of developing legume seeds. It explains the
  molecular structure of these proteins and their role in seed maturation and growth.
  The article also highlights the similarities between storage proteins and lectins,
  such as their subunit structures and the presence of sugar residues in their molecular
  structure.
