tldr: This report describes the changes in the topography and geology of St. Vincent
  after the 1902 Soufrière eruption. The authors observed the effects of denudation
  on the deposits left by the eruption, the return of vegetation, and the subsequent
  volcanic disturbances. They also studied the differences in the eruptions of the
  Soufrière and Montagne Pelée volcanoes.
