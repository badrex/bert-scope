tldr: The authors conducted experiments to investigate the duration of neuronal responses
  in the cerebral cortex when identifying visual stimuli. They found that when a mask
  was used, the length of time for which cells fired in response to the test stimulus
  decreased. This suggests that the mask stimulated adjacent cells in the cortex,
  reducing the responses of cells activated by the test stimulus. The results provide
  evidence that a cortical area can perform computations necessary for visual recognition
  in 20-30 ms, setting a fundamental constraint for theories of cortical computation.
