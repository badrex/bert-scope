tldr: This article investigates the energy absorbed by friction in the bores of rifled
  guns and its impact on projectile rotation and efficiency. The author examines different
  types of gunpowder, rifling designs, and driving bands to understand the effect
  of friction on the performance of rifled guns. The study shows that fouling in the
  bore due to pebble powder can cause a loss of energy, while parabolic rifling leads
  to higher friction and energy loss compared to uniform rifling.
