tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the formation of mercury molecules
  in the vapor state. They used an ionization chamber and a magnetic analyzer to analyze
  the ions and found evidence of diatomic mercury molecular ions (Hg2+) being formed
  by the attachment of excited atoms to normal atoms. This discovery reconciles the
  chemical evidence of mercury vapor being monatomic with the band spectra evidence
  of its presence.
