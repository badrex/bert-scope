tldr: The study investigates the turnover rate of sodium channels in rabbit Schwann
  cells using radiolabeled saxitoxin as a chemical marker. The results show that the
  average lifetime of sodium channels in cultured Schwann cells is about 3.1 days.
  The research also demonstrates that exposure to tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation,
  leads to a decrease in saxitoxin-binding capacity, further supporting the rapid
  turnover of sodium channels.
