tldr: The authors conducted experiments on decerebrate monkeys to study the postural
  and non-postural activities of the mid-brain. They discovered that certain lower
  centres in the brain control postural activities of the limbs, and that stimulation
  of the mid-brain can evoke specific postures in the animals. The study provides
  insights into the functioning of the motor cortex and neural pathways.
