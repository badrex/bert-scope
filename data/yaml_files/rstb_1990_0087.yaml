tldr: The article discusses the importance of palaeolimnology in understanding lake
  acidification and its effects on ecosystems. It highlights the use of diatoms as
  ideal index fossils for tracking changes in lake conditions and the importance of
  studying ecophysiological characteristics of organisms to quantify the impact of
  acidification. The author also reviews the results of the Surface Water Acidification
  Project (SWAP) and the methods used to date recent sediments and calibrate diatom
  pH transfer functions.
