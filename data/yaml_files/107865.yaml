tldr: The author examines the structure of human lung cells and their role in respiration.
  They discovered that the cells have a unique structure that allows for efficient
  gas exchange and circulation. The author also found that the current theory of respiration,
  which involves decarbonizing the blood, does not align with the anatomy and physiology
  of the lungs. Instead, they propose a simpler process where oxygen and carbon are
  exchanged through the lungs and carried to the heart.
