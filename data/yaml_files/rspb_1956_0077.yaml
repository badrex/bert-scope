tldr: The study examines the effects of shortening rabbit mandibular incisors and
  preventing their eruption on their growth rates. The results show that contact between
  upper and lower incisors controls the eruption of the rodent incisor under normal
  conditions. Eruption rates serve as an index of the rate of growth of new tissues
  at the incisor base, and the control of basal growth by occlusal pressure does not
  extend below a minimum level of eruption.
