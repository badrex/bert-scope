tldr: The article investigates the precision of the human visual system's ability
  to interpolate spatial and temporal information, specifically focusing on vernier
  acuity. The authors found that the visual system can accurately interpolate the
  position of a feature in the visual field, even when the target is moving. They
  also discovered that temporal and spatial interpolation depend on different parameters
  and that the basic properties of spatiotemporal interpolation can be understood
  in terms of the known properties of the visual system.
