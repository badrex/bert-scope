tldr: The article reports the X-ray analysis of the crystalline A-DNA fragment d(G-G-T-A-T-A-C-C),
  revealing a right-handed double helix conformation. The structure shows that the
  octamer forms a classical A-DNA type observed for the first time in a single crystal
  containing both A-T and G base pairs. The findings have implications for understanding
  gene control regions and the way function is governed by secondary structure in
  DNA.
