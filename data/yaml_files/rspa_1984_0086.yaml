tldr: The study investigates the transmission of energy in ribbed elastic structures
  submerged in a fluid. The research focuses on the role of fluid loading in the transmission
  of energy along the structure and its acoustic radiation field. The paper presents
  an exact formal solution for the force exerted on the structure by each rib and
  discusses the implications for structure-borne noise control, application of Statistical
  Energy Analysis, and Anderson localization in irregular structures under fluid loading.
