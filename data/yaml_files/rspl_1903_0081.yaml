tldr: The author presents a generalized theory of alternative inheritance, which is
  based on the pure gamete conception and is more general than Mendel's theory. The
  theory demonstrates broad features of inheritance that are in perfect accord with
  the biometric theory of inheritance in populations. The author also discusses the
  limitations of the Mendelian generalization when tested by actual numbers and points
  of theoretical divergence.
