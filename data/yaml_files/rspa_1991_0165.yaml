tldr: This article studies wave transmission along fluid-loaded plane elastic membranes
  supported by finite arrays of equally spaced ribs. The author provides an exact
  solution for a general finite configuration and explains the observed features,
  such as pass and stop bands, and the response of the arrays in the pass bands. The
  solution reveals that the forces at each rib form an interference pattern, which
  can be thought of as propagating inwards from each end. The results have implications
  for aeronautical and marine engineering applications.
