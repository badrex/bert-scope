tldr: Researchers discovered that messenger RNA from bovine retina can induce kainate
  and glycine receptors in Xenopus oocytes. This finding suggests that retinal cells
  contain different messengers that code for these neurotransmitter receptors. The
  kainate receptors are involved in the neurotoxic effects produced by kainate in
  the retina, while glycine receptors are similar to those elicited by glycine in
  oocytes injected with human or rat brain mRNA.
