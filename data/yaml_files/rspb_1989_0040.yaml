tldr: This article examines the role of inorganic nitrogen uptake in symbiotic marine
  cnidarians, specifically focusing on the relationship between the cnidarian host
  and the endosymbiotic algae. The study investigates the evidence for algal and host
  involvement in nutrient conservation and depletion, as well as the potential mechanisms
  for nutrient uptake. The findings suggest that the host plays a significant role
  in net ammonium uptake by intact symbioses, while the evidence for nitrate assimilation
  is equivocal. The depletion-diffusion model can account for net ammonium uptake,
  but not for phosphate or nitrate uptake. The study also discusses the possibility
  of phosphorus limitation as a means for the host to regulate algal growth in symbiosis.
