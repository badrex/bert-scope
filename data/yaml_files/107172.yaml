tldr: Humphry Davy discovered that boracic acid is a useful substance for analyzing
  stones containing fixed alkali. By fusing the stone with boracic acid and then decomposing
  it with mineral acids, Davy was able to separate and identify the various earths
  and metallic oxides present in the stone. This method allowed for a more accurate
  analysis of these stones and their components.
