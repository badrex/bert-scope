tldr: This article discusses the challenges and pitfalls of using archaeological and
  historical evidence to determine changes in relative land and sea levels in southern
  Britain during the Holocene period. The author highlights the imprecise nature of
  the data and the various factors that can affect depositional levels, land and sea
  junctions, and the heights of relative and absolute sea level. The article also
  examines the evidence for subsidence in southern Britain and the impact of human
  activities on the environment.
