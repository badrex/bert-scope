tldr: The author, W.K. Clifford, presents theorems related to the nature of space
  and the representation of curves in flat spaces of lower dimensions. He discusses
  the properties of curves of various orders and their applications in geometry. The
  paper also includes a description of an instrument for calculating integrals of
  products of given functions.
