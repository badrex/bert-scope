tldr: In 1723, William Saunderson observed a comet in Bombay and recorded its position
  and movement. Dr. Halley, who communicated the observations, also observed an eclipse
  of the Moon in Gomroon, Persia in 1724. These observations contributed to the understanding
  of celestial events during the early modern era.
