tldr: This article proposes improvements to statistical energy analysis (SEA) for
  periodic structures, which are commonly found in engineering applications such as
  off-shore platforms, box girder bridges, and satellites. The authors enhance SEA
  models by incorporating calculations of pass bands for typical elements of periodic
  structures, allowing for a more accurate representation of the non-uniform distribution
  of natural frequencies in these structures. This new approach provides better predictions
  for energy flow and can be applied to a wide range of geometrically periodic structures.
