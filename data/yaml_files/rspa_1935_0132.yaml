tldr: The author discusses the theory of the anomalous specific heats of crystals,
  focusing on the contribution of molecular rotations. They analyze the partition
  functions of solids and the success of previous theories in explaining observed
  facts. The author also highlights the importance of considering the anharmonic nature
  of oscillations at higher temperatures and the effect of molecular rotations on
  specific heat curves.
