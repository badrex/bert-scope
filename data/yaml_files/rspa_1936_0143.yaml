tldr: The authors apply a variational principle to multiple integrals and use it to
  develop a theory for quantization. They discuss the application of this theory to
  Born's rule, explaining how it maintains correspondence with classical mechanics
  while also incorporating quantum conditions. The authors also explore the implications
  of their method for Lagrangian mechanics and the role of conjugate variables in
  quantum mechanics.
