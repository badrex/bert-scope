tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine how the stress-optical properties
  of glass change with temperature. They found that the stress-optical coefficient
  increases with temperature and that these properties are not permanently fixed,
  but can vary with time and the life-history of the glass. The results suggest that
  further study of the effects of previous treatment on glass properties is necessary.
