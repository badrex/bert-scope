tldr: The author explores the process of cell fusion and its potential for analyzing
  malignancy in somatic cells. By fusing cells from different animal species and allowing
  them to undergo genetic amalgamation, the author investigates the behavior of hybrid
  cells and their potential for malignancy. This research could have implications
  for understanding and treating cancer.
