tldr: The author shares their zoological observations made at Talisse Island, North
  Celebes, focusing on a unique Alcyonarian species. They describe its anatomy, habitat,
  and the significance of its stolon structure, which closely resembles the extinct
  genus Syringopora. The author also discusses the relationship between Tubipora and
  Cornularia, suggesting that they should be united into a group called Stolonifera.
