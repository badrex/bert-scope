tldr: The author investigates long period inequalities in the motions of Earth and
  Venus, focusing on the effects of these inequalities on the planets' positions and
  the determination of their mean motions. The study provides insights into the importance
  of considering these inequalities in planetary theory and the potential impact on
  astronomical observations and calculations.
