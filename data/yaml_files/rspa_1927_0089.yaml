tldr: 'This article presents the determination of the thermal and electrical conductivity
  of a single crystal of aluminium. The crystal was prepared using a technique that
  involved three treatments: thermal, mechanical, and thermal. The results showed
  that the thermal conductivity of the single crystal was practically identical to
  that of an extruded bar of aluminium, and the electrical conductivity was determined
  by connecting the crystal to a potentiometer. The temperature coefficient of thermal
  conductivity had a slight positive value, which is significant for the development
  of aluminium''s metallurgy.'
