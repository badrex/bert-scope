tldr: This study investigates the mechanisms behind the shortening of action potentials
  in sheep Purkinje fibres at high and low stimulus rates. The research shows that
  the shortening at high rates is due to incomplete recovery of the plateau currents,
  while at low rates, it is related to declines in the maximum diastolic potential
  and the pacemaker potential. The findings suggest that the shortening of the action
  potential at low rates may be caused by a decline in the second inward current,
  which depends on a decline in intracellular sodium concentration.
