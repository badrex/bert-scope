tldr: The authors conducted an electron microscope study on the migration of lymphocytes
  through the endothelium of venules in lymph nodes. They discovered that lymphocytes
  migrate across the vessel wall by entering the endothelial cells and traversing
  their cytoplasm, rather than passing through the intercellular junctions. This research
  provides insights into the immune system's function and the role of lymphocytes
  in the body.
