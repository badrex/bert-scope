tldr: The authors investigated the addition of methyl radicals to isolated, conjugated,
  and cumulated dienes. They found that isolated dienes behave like mono-olefins,
  while conjugated dienes exhibit high reactivity due to resonance stabilization.
  Methyl substituents affect reactivity through hyperconjugation and steric 'blocking'
  effects. The reactivity of cumulated dienes is extremely low, with a low A factor
  contributing to their low reactivity.
