tldr: The authors studied the cofactor and metal requirements for the proper functioning
  of brain mitochondria. They found that adenosine triphosphate, coenzyme I, glutathione,
  cobalt, and a new unidentified factor are essential for maintaining the integrity
  of brain mitochondria. The authors also discovered a complex interrelationship between
  these cofactors and metals, and that copper can antagonize the action of cobalt.
