tldr: A large fossil tooth of an elephant discovered in Norwich provides evidence
  for significant changes in Earth's history. The author discusses the possible alterations
  in Earth's climate and geography, suggesting that the continents may have been in
  different positions in the past. The discovery of various fossils and marine life
  buried in the Earth supports the idea that Earth has undergone major transformations.
