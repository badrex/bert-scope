tldr: This article provides a critical review of the theoretical and experimental
  methods for studying low-energy positive ions in gases. It summarizes the available
  data for ions in atomic and molecular gases and highlights the need for more experimental
  measurements and theoretical computations. The authors also present an experimental
  investigation of the motion of slow positive ions in nitrogen, argon, and hydrogen,
  discussing the principles of their apparatus and the results obtained.
