tldr: The authors, N. V. Sidgwick and H. M. Powell, explore the stereochemical types
  and valency groups in chemistry. They discuss the arrangement of covalencies in
  polyvalent atoms and how these arrangements are influenced by the size of the valency
  group and the number of shared electrons. The authors also examine the structures
  of molecules and the methods used to determine their relative positions in space,
  such as X-ray diffraction, absorption spectra, and Raman spectra.
