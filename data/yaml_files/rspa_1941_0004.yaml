tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the mobility of positive ions in
  their own gas, focusing on neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. They discovered that
  the mobility of ions in their own gas is lower than that of corresponding alkali
  ions due to the phenomenon of electron exchange. This study provides insights into
  the behavior of ions in gases and the impact of electron exchange on ion mobility.
