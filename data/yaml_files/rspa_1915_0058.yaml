tldr: The author investigates the effect of the form of the transverse section on
  the frictional resistance of elongated bodies moving parallel to their length through
  fluids. They examine the resistance offered by the walls of a circular pipe and
  propose a formula for calculating the resistance per unit area. The author also
  discusses the resistance of bodies immersed in fluid streams and the influence of
  projecting keels or ridges on that resistance.
