tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the relationship between magnetic
  stress and magnetic deformation in nickel. They measured the magnetization and the
  effect of tension on magnetization for different field strengths and tensions using
  the ballistic method. The magnetic elongation of a long nickel wire was also measured
  for various field strengths and tensions. The results showed that the observed contraction
  was greater than the contraction calculated from the theory of stresses, and the
  difference between them was approximately proportional to the fourth power of the
  magnetization.
