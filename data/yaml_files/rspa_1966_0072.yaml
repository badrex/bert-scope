tldr: This article presents a theory for the electronic states of mixed molecular
  crystals, focusing on shallow traps. The authors develop a method to treat the energy
  states of mixed crystals with impurity molecules differing only by isotopic substitutions
  from the host molecules. They provide formulae for energy levels and transition
  moments for dilute crystals and crystals with any concentration of guests arranged
  in a superlattice. The theory is applied to mixed crystals of naphthalene and deuteronaphthalenes
  in a following paper.
