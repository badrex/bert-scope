tldr: This article discusses the methods used to observe solar variability, such as
  sunspot occurrence, latitudinal distribution, and rotation rates. The author assesses
  the accuracy and limitations of these methods and interprets the periodicities found.
  The main conclusion is that solar variability has appeared in the form of recurrent
  expulsions of magnetic activity at the Sun's surface, accompanied by a modulation
  of its rotation and periodic changes in its radius. The author suggests a connection
  between solar variability and the Earth's meteorology, which could be of great importance
  if proven.
