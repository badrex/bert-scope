tldr: The authors present a simple and accurate method for measuring the velocity
  constants of rapid reactions in solution by observing the maximum or minimum temperature
  reached during the reaction under non-adiabatic conditions. They describe a theoretical
  treatment for first-order and second-order reactions and demonstrate the method's
  effectiveness with experimental data for various reactions.
