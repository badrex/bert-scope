tldr: This article presents a review of recent methodical developments in neutron
  spectroscopy, diffraction, and beam techniques at the Institut Laue-Langevin. Topics
  covered include high-resolution spectroscopy, methods for enhancing intensities
  and count rates, production of high-intensity polarized neutrons, and achieving
  high fluxes or densities of ultra-cold neutrons. The article discusses various techniques
  such as time-of-flight methods, backscattering spectroscopy, and spin echo spectroscopy,
  and their applications in biology, chemistry, and physics.
