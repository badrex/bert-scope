tldr: The authors studied the magnetic properties of superconducting mercury colloids
  with varying particle sizes. They found that the initial slopes of the magnetization
  curves were proportional to the applied magnetic field, and the penetration depth
  was affected by the particle size and temperature. The results were compared with
  the predictions of the London theory and Pippard's modification, with the latter
  showing better agreement. The study also provided insights into the surface energy
  and the two-fluid model of the superconducting state.
