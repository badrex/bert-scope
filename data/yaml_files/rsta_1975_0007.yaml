tldr: This article discusses the origin and properties of primary cosmic-ray nuclei
  with energies above 10^10 GeV. The author analyzes the data on these high-energy
  particles and their distribution in the sky, investigating the possibility of extragalactic
  origin and the role of magnetic fields in their behavior. The findings suggest that
  the arrival directions of these particles are randomly distributed, with no significant
  anisotropy detected.
