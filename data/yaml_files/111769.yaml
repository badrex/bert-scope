tldr: The author presents a theory that muscular contraction is an effect of the universal
  law of gravitation. They argue that contraction happens on the cessation of stimulation,
  due to the operation of the attraction principle shared by all matter. The author
  discusses various objections to the theory and provides explanations for the phenomena
  of tremor, convulsion, and spasm, as well as the role of nervous influence and muscle
  polar action.
