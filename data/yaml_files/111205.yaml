tldr: The author analyzes the mathematical theory of waves, focusing on positive and
  negative waves. They deduce the velocity of transmission and the horizontal motion
  of particles in waves, and discuss the differences between oscillating and non-oscillating
  waves. The author also examines the possibility of a series of oscillatory waves
  in a channel of uniform breadth and depth, and questions the accuracy of a previous
  solution by Mr. Airy.
