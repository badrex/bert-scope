tldr: The author investigates the red lines of neon and their suitability as secondary
  standards for wavelength measurements. They find that the neon lines are accurate
  and suitable for use as secondary standards when observed with high resolving power
  interferometers. The author also discusses the effects of using interferometers
  of low resolving power and provides corrections for their use as standards.
