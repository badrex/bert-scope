tldr: The authors investigated the impact of glycerol concentration on the viability
  of erythrocytes stored in the frozen state. They found that a final glycerol concentration
  of 4.5M allowed red cells to deteriorate very slowly, maintaining their organic
  phosphates content and post-transfusion survival. However, exposure to high glycerol
  concentrations for brief periods can damage red cell metabolism and decrease post-transfusion
  survival.
