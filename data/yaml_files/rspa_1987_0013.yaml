tldr: This article investigates the domino effect, where regularly spaced elements
  in a periodic array topple one after another due to collisions. The author explores
  the necessary conditions for initiation and the speed of propagation of this wave
  in an array of identical elements that collide with their neighbors during unstable
  collapse. The study focuses on the intrinsic speed of wave propagation, which depends
  on geometric parameters and the coefficient of restitution, with friction playing
  a secondary role.
