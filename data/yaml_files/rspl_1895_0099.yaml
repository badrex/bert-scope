tldr: The author conducted experiments to investigate whether X-rays affect the contact
  potential of metal plates. They used a vacuum bulb and induction coil to produce
  X-rays and enclosed the apparatus in a metal-lined box to screen it from electrical
  disturbances. The results showed that X-rays do not cause a significant change in
  the contact potential difference between metal plates.
