tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the distribution of velocity and temperature
  in turbulent flow between concentric rotating cylinders. They found that the Modified
  Vorticity Transport theory and the Momentum Transport theory give contrasting results
  when applied to this flow. The author also measured the velocity distribution using
  different types of Pitot tubes and discussed the effects of the tubes on the measurements.
