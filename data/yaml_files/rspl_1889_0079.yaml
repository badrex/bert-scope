tldr: The author conducted experiments to determine if green plants could assimilate
  carbon from certain organic compounds, specifically aldehydes. They found that while
  some aldehydes, like glycerin, could be converted into starch, others, like formic
  aldehyde, could not. This study contributed to the understanding of how plants synthesize
  carbohydrates and the role of aldehydes in the process.
