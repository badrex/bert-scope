tldr: The authors studied the magnetic anisotropy behavior of seventeen hydrated salts
  of the iron group elements, focusing on nickel salts. They found that these salts
  have smaller anisotropy and their temperature variation deviates more from the Curie
  law compared to similar salts. The authors also discovered that the crystalline
  and ionic magnetic axes change direction with temperature, and the anisotropic field
  coefficients related to orbital and spin splittings of energy levels vary significantly
  from salt to salt and with temperature. The study provides insights into the magnetic
  properties of these hydrated salts and their potential applications.
