tldr: This study investigates the atomic arrangements in dilute iridium-based substitutional
  solid solutions using field-ion microscopy. The research aims to understand the
  structure and properties of these materials by examining the local arrangements
  around particular atoms. Field-ion microscopy provides direct information about
  the location of specific species and reveals aspects of the surface electronic state
  of each atom with respect to its coordinating surroundings.
