tldr: The author investigates the diffusion of ions into gases and the conductivity
  of ionized gas, focusing on the effects of Rontgen rays. They develop a mathematical
  model to calculate the coefficients of diffusion and discuss the implications of
  their findings for understanding molecular physics and the behavior of ions in gases.
