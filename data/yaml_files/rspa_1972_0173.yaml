tldr: The authors present a theory of spin-flip Raman scattering in semiconductors
  and demonstrate a magnetically tunable infrared laser using indium antimonide. They
  discuss the experimental results and compare them with the microscale theory, confirming
  the basic model and showcasing the potential of this tunable laser. This method
  can be used to investigate various physical and chemical processes, such as molecular
  vibrations, semiconductor energy gaps, and more.
