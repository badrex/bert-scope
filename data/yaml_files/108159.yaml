tldr: The author, Michael Faraday, conducted experiments with the Gymnotus fish to
  investigate the identity of its electrical power with common electricity. He compared
  the Gymnotus with the Torpedo and found that the electrical power in both animals
  was the same. The experiments involved using different collectors and apparatus
  to measure the strength and direction of the electric current. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of animal electricity and its connection to inorganic electricity.
