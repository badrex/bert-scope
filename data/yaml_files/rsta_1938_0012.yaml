tldr: The authors develop a generalized magneto-ionic theory to study the oblique
  propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere. They investigate the
  effects of the Earth's magnetic field on wave-packets and the level of reflection
  in the ionosphere. The study is applicable to any plane-stratified doubly refracting
  medium and provides insights into the behavior of radio waves in the ionosphere.
