tldr: 'This study examines the development of the thymus, epithelial bodies, and thyroid
  glands in three species of marsupials: Phascolarctos, Phascolomys, and Perameles.
  The research focuses on the origin and formation of these glands and their similarities
  and differences among the species. The findings reveal the role of the ultimobranchial
  body in the formation of thyroid tissue and the parallelism between these marsupials
  and the mole in the development of the cervical thymus.'
