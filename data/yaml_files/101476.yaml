tldr: The author shares their observations of an earthquake near Oxford and the behavior
  of their thermoscope and baroscope during that time. They discuss how their instruments
  reacted to various weather conditions, such as fog, rain, and sunshine, and how
  these conditions affected the height of the liquid in their instruments. The author
  also compares their instruments to those of Robert Boyle and notes the differences
  in their readings.
