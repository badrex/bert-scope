tldr: The study investigates the chemical resistance of the impregnating material
  in the cockroach cuticle, specifically in Periplaneta americana. The impregnation
  involves a sterol-protein complex, and the cuticle's chemical stability increases
  during the tanning process. The research also explores the effects of acids, alkali,
  and Diaphanol on the cuticle, revealing the sterol's role in conferring resistance
  to solution.
