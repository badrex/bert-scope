tldr: The authors studied the misorientation structure within (001) facets of CVD-grown
  diamond crystallites using optical microtopography, interferometry, electron diffraction,
  and cathodoluminescence. They discovered that the large (001) facets have characteristic
  growth step patterns and related cathodoluminescence patterns. The conflict between
  the interpretation of step patterns and the facet surface profiles determined interferometrically
  was resolved by quadrantal division of (001) facets by low-angle boundaries. This
  model was confirmed by electron channelling and electron backscatter diffraction
  techniques.
