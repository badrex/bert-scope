tldr: This article discusses the understanding of nuclear structure based on the known
  two-body interaction. It explores the role of isospin in nuclear properties and
  the complexity of nuclear forces compared to the Coulomb force. The article also
  reviews the methods used to calculate nuclear properties from these forces and the
  challenges in understanding the off-shell behavior of the potential.
