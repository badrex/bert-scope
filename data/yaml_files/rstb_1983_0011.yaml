tldr: The article discusses various methods of immobilizing cells for industrial and
  diagnostic purposes. It covers techniques such as aggregation, adsorption, and entrapment
  within gels. The use of immobilized cells has potential in the production of L-malic
  acid, L-aspartic acid, and steroid conversions. The article also highlights the
  criteria for successful cell immobilization and compares immobilized cell processes
  with alternative methods like batch or continuous fermentation, enzyme processes,
  and chemical or agricultural processes.
