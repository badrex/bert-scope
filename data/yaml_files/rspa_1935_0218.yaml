tldr: The author investigates the acoustic radiation pressure on circular discs in
  various types of sound wave fields, using a torsion balance and cylindrical wave
  functions. They find that the radiation pressure on a disc depends on the nature
  of the sound wave field and the mode of generation of the sound waves. The author
  provides a formula for the radiation pressure and discusses the effects of diffraction
  and inertia on the discs.
