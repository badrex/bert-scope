tldr: This study investigates the surface potential and properties of monomolecular
  insoluble films formed by nitriles at an air-water interface. The researchers found
  that the surface potential in condensed films of nitriles was constant, and the
  dielectric constant of these films was about 7, which is lower than that of water.
  The transition between condensed and expanded films is heterogeneous, and the effective
  dielectric constant of the surroundings of the film molecules is estimated to be
  around 7.
