tldr: The authors derive the Nutku-Halil solution for colliding impulsive gravitational
  waves with uncorrelated polarizations. They set up equations for space-times with
  two space-like Killing-vectors and reduce them to a single Ernst-type equation.
  The simplest linear solution of the Ernst equation leads to the Nutku-Halil solution,
  which is further described in a Newman-Penrose formalism.
