tldr: Henry Cavendish conducted experiments to understand the properties of air and
  the effects of the electric spark on it. He discovered that when air is exposed
  to an electric spark, it is converted into nitrous acid, rather than fixed air as
  previously thought. This finding challenged the prevailing phlogiston theory and
  contributed to the understanding of gas laws and acid-base chemistry.
