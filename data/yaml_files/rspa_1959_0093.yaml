tldr: The authors calculate the Lamb shift of a tightly bound electron in mercury
  using a method described in a preceding paper. They find the Lamb shift to be 38
  Ry, which, when combined with other theoretical calculations, results in a theoretical
  binding energy of -6099 Ry. This value can be compared with the experimental value
  of 6109 Ry for the K-absorption edge. The authors discuss other contributions of
  order that have not been evaluated in this paper but plan to calculate them in the
  future.
