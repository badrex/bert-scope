tldr: This article explores the behavior and influence of fluids in subduction zones,
  focusing on how they affect the trace element compositions of subduction zone magmas.
  The authors discuss the role of fluids in transporting elements from the subducted
  slab to the mantle wedge and how this contributes to the growth of the Earth's continental
  crust. They also examine the importance of the slab-derived flux and the wedge-derived
  flux in determining the chemical budget of subduction zones.
