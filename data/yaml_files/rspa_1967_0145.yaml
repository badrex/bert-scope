tldr: This article presents absorption measurements in 6H and 15R silicon carbide,
  focusing on the anisotropy of free carrier absorption. The authors demonstrate that
  the absorption coefficients for radiation with its electric vector perpendicular
  to the symmetry axis are greater than those for parallel polarization. They also
  discuss the wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficients in the high-frequency
  region and the effects of anisotropy in the effective mass and relaxation time on
  the absorption. The results provide insights into the conduction bands in silicon
  carbide and help determine the effective mass and relaxation time in the material.
