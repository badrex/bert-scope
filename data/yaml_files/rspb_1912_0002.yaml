tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of dissolved substances
  on yeast autofermentation. They discovered that salts, both inorganic and organic,
  increase the rate of autofermentation. This is due to the removal of water from
  the yeast cell, which leads to more efficient working of the glycogenase enzyme.
  The study also found that the direct action of salt on enzymes is inhibitory, and
  plasmolysis of the cell is not the cause of the acceleration.
