tldr: The author presents an analytical method to determine bifurcations in impact
  oscillators, specifically focusing on grazing bifurcations. These bifurcations occur
  when part of an orbit just touches a stop, and the author finds both codimension
  one and codimension two bifurcations in the impact oscillator model. The study helps
  in understanding the behavior of impact oscillators in various engineering and physical
  systems.
