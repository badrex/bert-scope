tldr: The authors conducted experiments with isolated chloroplasts from Stellaria
  media to study the reduction of ferric oxalate and its relation to photosynthesis.
  They found that varying light intensity and the presence of urethane affected the
  ferric oxalate reaction. The results suggest that the light reaction in photosynthesis
  is the production of the oxygen molecule, rather than the reduction of carbon dioxide.
