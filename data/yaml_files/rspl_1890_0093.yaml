tldr: The author examines the structure of striped muscle fibers using new methods
  of investigation, such as creating impressions in collodion. They discover that
  the cross-striping of muscle fibers is an optical expression of their varicose nature
  and not due to internal structural differences. This finding challenges the widely
  held belief that alternating stripes in muscle fibers represent different structures
  and contributes to a better understanding of muscle contraction.
