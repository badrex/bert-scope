tldr: The article discusses the importance of studying protein systems in understanding
  the emergence of man from his immediate primate ancestry. It highlights the need
  to analyze protein systems that can modulate cell and tissue development, as well
  as those associated with DNA in the genetic material. The author emphasizes the
  significance of understanding these protein systems in relation to DNA and RNA sequences
  to define the cumulative processes of hominization.
