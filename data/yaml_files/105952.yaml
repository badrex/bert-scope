tldr: The author, John Michell, investigates the probable parallax and magnitude of
  fixed stars based on the quantity of light they provide and their specific circumstances.
  He calculates the distance at which the Sun would appear as bright as other planets
  and stars, and discusses the challenges in determining the actual size and brightness
  of stars. Michell also suggests that future advancements in instruments could potentially
  help discover the parallax of some stars.
