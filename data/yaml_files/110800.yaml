tldr: The author, Martin Barry, explains the process of fissiparous generation, where
  cells reproduce by dividing themselves. He introduces the concept of a hyaline substance,
  which is present in cells and plays a crucial role in reproduction. This substance
  can assimilate new matter, divide, and exhibit contractile power. Barry applies
  this theory to the development of the ovum and the changes in blood corpuscles,
  showing how it is related to the formation of various tissues and organs.
