tldr: The author discusses the use of modern technology in testing theories of gravitation,
  focusing on the constancy of the gravitational constant and other gravitational
  experiments. They explore various relativistic effects and the importance of solar
  system tests, as well as the potential of astrophysical systems as laboratories
  for studying gravity. The author emphasizes the need for new, physically realizable
  experiments to further test and understand gravitational theories, including general
  relativity.
