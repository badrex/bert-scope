tldr: The author, Stephen Groombridge, conducted a series of observations using a
  four-foot transit circle to study the atmospheric refraction and its effects on
  astronomical observations. He found that the mean refraction at 45 degrees is approximately
  58 arcseconds and that the formula for refraction by Dr. Bradley needs to be corrected
  for lower altitudes. Groombridge's work contributes to the understanding of refraction
  and its impact on practical astronomy.
