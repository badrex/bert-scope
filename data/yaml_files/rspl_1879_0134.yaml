tldr: The authors conducted further experiments on the time-relations of the excitatory
  process in the ventricle of the frog's heart. They discovered that the electrical
  effect of excitation manifests itself in two phases, an initial and a terminal one,
  with opposite signs. The initial phase begins 0.06 seconds after excitation and
  rapidly reaches its maximum, while the reversal of sign occurs at 0.26 seconds.
  These findings contribute to the understanding of the physiological relations of
  the excitatory state in excitable tissues.
