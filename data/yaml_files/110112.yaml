tldr: In 1825, a series of observations were conducted by the British Board of Longitude
  and the French Ministry of War to determine the difference in meridians between
  the Royal Observatories of Greenwich and Paris. The observations involved the use
  of signals from rockets with gunpowder explosions, observed at multiple stations
  along the path between the two observatories. The final result found the difference
  in longitude to be 9Â° 21' 1 6, with a high degree of accuracy.
