tldr: This article discusses the turbulent suspension of sediments in the deep sea,
  focusing on observations made during the High-Energy Benthic Boundary Layer Experiment
  (HEBBLE). The authors describe the dynamics of erosion events and the suspended
  sediment field, and they develop a time-dependent model to recreate the effects
  of local storms. They also explore the role of sediment-induced stratification in
  the growth of the near-bed turbulence-supported nepheloid layer and discuss the
  applicability of various closure models to benthic sediment transport storms.
