tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the decomposition of carbon disulphide
  using a silent electric discharge. They discovered that the gas can be converted
  into a gaseous form of carbon monosulphide, which can then polymerize and explode
  at slightly higher temperatures. This suggests the existence of a new volatile sulphide
  of carbon.
