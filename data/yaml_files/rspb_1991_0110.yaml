tldr: The author conducted whole-cell recordings of the light-induced current in dissociated
  Drosophila photoreceptors and found evidence for feedback by calcium permeating
  the light-sensitive channels. The study suggests that calcium ions entering the
  cell during the light response play a significant role in determining the response's
  kinetics. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of phototransduction
  in invertebrate rhabdomeric photoreceptors.
