tldr: In March 1833, the Earl of Darnley observed a luminous appearance in the sky
  over Ireland. The phenomenon, which resembled a stream of light flowing from east
  to west, was not accompanied by the usual flashes of an Aurora. Stars of the second
  and third magnitudes were visible through the arch, and the phenomenon lasted for
  about twenty minutes before disappearing. Similar sightings were reported in other
  locations with similar timings.
