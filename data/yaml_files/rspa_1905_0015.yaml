tldr: This article discusses the phenomenon of fluorescence and absorption in uranium
  glass. The author, John Butler Burke, explains that the difference in absorption
  of fluorescent light is due to the formation of unstable molecular aggregates by
  more refrangible or exciting rays. The luminosity or fluorescence is the visible
  manifestation of the building up and breaking down of these molecular agglomerations.
  The author also addresses the misconception that the spectrum of fluorescent and
  phosphorescent bodies is continuous, arguing that it is made up of finer bands or
  lines.
