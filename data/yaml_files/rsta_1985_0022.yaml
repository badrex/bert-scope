tldr: This article investigates near-limiting gravity waves in water of finite depth,
  focusing on waves with rounded crests. The authors use a modified integral equation
  technique to compute these waves and find that the local profile at the crest tends
  to an asymptotic self-similar form. The results agree well with previous calculations
  for steep waves at the extremes of solitary and deep-water waves, confirming the
  existence of a subsequent minimum in certain integral quantities as predicted by
  Longuet-Higgins and Fox.
