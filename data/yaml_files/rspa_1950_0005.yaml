tldr: This article discusses the chemical nature and properties of aluminium soaps,
  focusing on their reactions with fatty acids and the formation of di-soaps and mono-soaps.
  The authors explore the role of water in these reactions and propose a polymeric
  formula for aluminium soaps based on sixfold coordination aluminium-oxygen octahedra.
  They also investigate the physical nature of aluminium soaps in organic solvents
  and their similarities to natural and synthetic polymers.
