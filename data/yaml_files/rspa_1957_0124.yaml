tldr: The authors investigated the antiferromagnetism of manganese-copper alloys using
  neutron diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, and electrical resistivity measurements.
  They found that the Neel temperature increases with increasing manganese content
  and determined the magnetic moments of manganese ions in the alloys. The results
  are discussed in terms of an electron band model of an antiferromagnetic metal.
