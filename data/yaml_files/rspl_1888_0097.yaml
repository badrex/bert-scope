tldr: This study investigates the effect of floor-deafening on the sanitary condition
  of dwelling houses. It finds that deafening material in poorer class houses contains
  high levels of nitrogenous organic matter and chlorides, which can lead to air pollution
  and ill-health. In contrast, better class houses with good quality deafening material
  and proper maintenance have less risk of air pollution.
