tldr: This article presents an X-ray study of the structure of hair, wool, and related
  fibers. The researchers found that a significant portion of the structure of these
  fibers is crystalline or pseudo-crystalline, and that the X-ray photographs of unstretched
  and stretched hair are different. The study also reveals the dimensions of the fibers
  and their molecular structure, providing insights into their properties and behavior.
