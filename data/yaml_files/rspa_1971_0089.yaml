tldr: The authors develop a closed-form solution for the melting or solidification
  of a half-space under a general surface heat input. They use the embedding technique
  to show that the shape of the phase interface is a universal function, independent
  of the heat input distribution and material properties. The solution is useful for
  understanding the initial stages of melting and solidification processes in materials.
