tldr: In January 1898, a team of observers, led by Captain E. H. Hills and H. F. Newall,
  traveled to Pulgaon, India, to observe the total solar eclipse. They made various
  meteorological and astronomical observations, including using a double tube camera
  and a magnetometer. The team faced challenges such as weather conditions and shadow
  bands, but their experience provided valuable insights into the study of solar eclipses
  and the instruments used during the observation.
