tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of alkalies, acids, and
  alkaline-acid salts on the growth and cell division in fertilized eggs of Echinus
  esculentus. They found that variations in hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentrations
  led to profound alterations in cell growth and division. The experiments also showed
  that increased alkalinity could induce pathological mitoses, similar to those seen
  in cancer cells. The study provides insights into the relationship between changes
  in ion concentrations and the development of malignant diseases.
