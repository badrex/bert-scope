tldr: This study investigates the adsorption of argon gas on amorphous carbon at various
  temperatures. The results show that the isotherms for argon on charcoal are linear,
  suggesting that the process is not influenced by surface conditions. The authors
  also discuss the challenges of maintaining constant temperatures and achieving true
  equilibrium in low-temperature experiments.
