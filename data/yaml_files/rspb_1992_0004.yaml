tldr: The authors studied the properties of the cGMP-activated channel in retinal
  on-bipolar cells and compared them with rod photoreceptors. They found that the
  on-bipolar cell channel was blocked by L-m-diltiazem, a block that was strongly
  voltage-dependent. However, the on-bipolar cell channel was not identical to the
  photoreceptor channel. The study also showed that the conductance of the on-bipolar
  cell channels was unaffected by the removal of external divalent cations.
