tldr: This article discusses the energy of deformation during sliding and its relation
  to friction. The authors analyze the deformation produced by sliding and equate
  it to the frictional work. They find that the surface zone absorbs a large amount
  of deformation energy, which is dissipated as heat. The authors also compare the
  work done in rolling friction and sliding friction, highlighting the differences
  between the two.
