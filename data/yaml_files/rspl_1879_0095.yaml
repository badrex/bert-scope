tldr: The author examines the composition of protagon, a substance found in the brain,
  and its impurities. They analyze the claims made by other researchers, such as Dr.
  Thudichum, and test the presence of potassium in a sample of protagon. The author
  concludes that the claims of impurities and potassium content in protagon are unfounded
  and that the substance has a uniform chemical composition.
