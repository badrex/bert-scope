tldr: John Hadley developed a spirit level to be fixed to a quadrant for taking meridional
  altitude at sea when the horizon is not visible. This method allows for determining
  latitude without the need for the horizon, which is an inconvenience in calm weather.
  The spirit level is composed of a glass tube with scales of degrees, and it can
  be set on a limb of the quadrant. The instrument can be supported by a staff resting
  on the floor, and it can be used with a telescope or plain sights. This method is
  useful for marine navigation and can be acceptable for public use.
