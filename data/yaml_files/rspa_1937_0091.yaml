tldr: The author presents a completely relativistic formulation of the law of gravitation
  using purely kinematic methods. The results yield an inverse square law of gravitation
  with a "gravitational constant" proportional to the time reckoned from the natural
  origin of time. The analysis incorporates the expanding universe and explains the
  general spiral character of galaxies and certain features of the motions observed
  in our own galaxy.
