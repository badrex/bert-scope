tldr: The author, Thomas Young, developed a numerical table to represent the mutual
  attractive forces of components in different salts. This table helps in understanding
  the sequence of double elective attractions and can be used to predict the behavior
  of chemical reactions. The author also discusses the importance of accurate representation
  and orthography in chemistry.
