tldr: The article discusses the flora of the Solomon Islands, which resembles the
  Malesian flora but has fewer families, genera, and species. The author presents
  evidence that the Solomon Islands' flora has not arrived by long-distance dispersal
  and suggests that there have been stronger land connections within the region and
  with Malesia in the past. The author also explores the implications of the Solomon
  Islands' flora on the evolution of flowering plants in the tropics.
