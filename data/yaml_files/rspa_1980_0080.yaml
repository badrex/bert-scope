tldr: The authors develop a model based on recovery-controlled creep to describe the
  behavior of materials after a stress reduction at high temperatures. They test the
  model using experimental data from a nickel-base alloy and provide an objective
  method for measuring friction stress. The results indicate the existence of a finite
  friction stress and support the use of the model for predicting creep behavior in
  various materials.
