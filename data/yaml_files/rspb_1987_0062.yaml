tldr: The authors studied the properties of normal and non-inactivating single cardiac
  sodium channels using the patch clamp technique in inside-out patches from cultured
  neonatal rat heart cardiocytes. They found two populations of channels with normal
  and reduced unitary current sizes. The study aimed to clarify channel kinetics and
  the nature of substates, and to understand the effects of chemical modification
  induced by external application of glutaraldehyde or racemic DPI 201-106 on channel
  activity.
