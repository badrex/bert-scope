tldr: This article presents an alternative approach to the linear perturbation theory
  of two-dimensional compressible flow by introducing a new function that satisfies
  a linear partial differential equation. The author applies this theory to the specific
  example of unsteady flow around an oscillating cylinder, focusing on wave propagation.
  The study finds that progressive wave types can be propagated with the velocity
  of sound at a stagnation point, and the amplitude decreases as the distance from
  the oscillating cylinder increases.
