tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the excitation of inner electrons
  in zinc, cadmium, and mercury using electron impact. They discovered that the ultra-ionization
  potential losses in these elements could be explained by the excitation of inner
  electrons, a process that had not been previously recognized in electron collision
  experiments. This finding connects optical and X-ray spectra and provides a better
  understanding of atomic physics.
