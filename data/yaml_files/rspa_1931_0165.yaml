tldr: This study investigates the sorption of hydrogen on copper at temperatures between
  0°C and 100°C, examining both adsorption and absorption processes. The authors found
  that the rate of solution and the adsorption isotherms can be described by mathematical
  equations, providing insight into the interaction between hydrogen and copper surfaces.
  The results have implications for understanding gas-solid interactions and the diffusion
  of gases in metals.
