- Temperate Forests
tldr: This article compares the micrometeorological responses of temperate and tropical
  forest stands, focusing on aspects of vegetation-atmosphere interaction that influence
  energy, momentum, and water exchange. The study highlights differences in forest
  structure, such as height, biomass, and leaf area, and their impact on micrometeorological
  properties. The article also discusses the importance of understanding these differences
  for climate modeling and global climate studies.
