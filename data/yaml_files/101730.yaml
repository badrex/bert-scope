tldr: In 1676, Mr. Flamstead and Mr. Edmund Halley observed and recorded the movements
  and characteristics of sunspots. They compared their observations made in Greenwich
  and Oxford and found that the differences were excusable due to the size and shape
  of the spots. Their findings suggest that the sun's axis was inclined to the plane
  of the orbit, and they estimated the nodes of the sun's equinox and ecliptic. The
  observations were limited by the spots breaking into multiple parts and changing
  positions.
