tldr: This article investigates the distribution function for the displacements of
  grains suspended in a non-uniform fluid. The author finds that the concentration
  of grains is inversely proportional to the non-uniformity of the fluid, and that
  this distribution is affected by temperature gradients. The results have implications
  for understanding the behavior of particles in fluids at non-uniform temperatures
  and in liquid solutions.
