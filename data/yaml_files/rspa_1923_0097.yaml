tldr: The authors conducted experiments with positive rays to test the theory of radiation.
  They found that visual and photographic effects can be obtained with trains of waves
  shorter than those produced in the emission of a quantum of light, which challenges
  existing views on radiation. This suggests that either the energy is concentrated
  at points for each quantum emitted, or the energy has been present in the atoms
  all the time and is released by a trigger effect.
