tldr: This article discusses the behavior and influence of fluids in subduction zones,
  focusing on their composition, origin, role in diagenesis, and importance for oceanic
  chemical fluxes. The authors analyze fluid-solid diagenetic and metamorphic reactions
  in convergent plate margins and explore internal and external fluid sources, including
  porosity reduction, diagenetic and metamorphic dehydration, and the breakdown of
  hydrous minerals.
