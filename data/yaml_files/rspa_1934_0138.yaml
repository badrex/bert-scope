tldr: This article discusses the rapid degradation of compressional waves of high
  frequency in gases and the mechanisms behind the absorption phenomenon. The author
  presents various methods for creating and detecting supersonic waves, including
  the use of hot-wire anemometers and quartz oscillators. The study focuses on measuring
  the absorption and velocity of sound in gases, providing valuable insights into
  the behavior of supersonic waves.
