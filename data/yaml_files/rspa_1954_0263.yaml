tldr: The authors measured the second virial coefficients of binary mixtures of cyclohexane
  with diethylamine, acetonitrile, and acetone at 53Â°C. The experimental results show
  that polar vapours have larger second virial coefficients than predicted by the
  principle of corresponding states. This deviation can be explained by the hypothesis
  that polar vapours undergo partial association due to dipole interactions or hydrogen
  bonding. The authors used this hypothesis to create a theoretical treatment for
  the mixtures and compared it to the experimental results.
