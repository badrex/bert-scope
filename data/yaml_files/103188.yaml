tldr: Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to study the ascending of drops of spirit
  of wine between two glass planes. He observed the distances from the touching ends
  of the planes and the angles of elevation. The experiment helped him understand
  the behavior of fluids and the forces acting on them, contributing to the study
  of fluid dynamics and surface tension.
