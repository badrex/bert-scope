  Fields and Adsorption'

tldr: The authors study the interaction of atoms and molecules with solid surfaces,
  focusing on the diffraction of atoms and the properties of surface fields. They
  develop a mathematical model to calculate the intensity of diffracted beams and
  explore the probability of selective adsorption and evaporation processes. Their
  findings contribute to understanding the behavior of atoms on surfaces and the establishment
  of equilibrium between gas and adsorbed phases.
