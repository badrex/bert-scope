tldr: The article investigates the conformational differences between the cellular
  prion protein (PrPc) and its infectious form (PrPSc) using spectroscopic methods
  like Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy. The study reveals that PrPc
  is rich in alpha-helix, while PrPSc has a higher beta-sheet content. This conformational
  transition is crucial for understanding prion diseases.
