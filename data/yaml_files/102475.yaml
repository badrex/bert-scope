tldr: The author, William Derham, conducted experiments to measure the height of mercury
  in barometers at different heights, specifically on a monument. He found that for
  every 82 feet of height, the mercury descends about 1/10 of an inch. Derham also
  provided a detailed description of a portable barometer design that could be useful
  for such experiments.
