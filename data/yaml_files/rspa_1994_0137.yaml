tldr: This study investigates the influence of solute additions, such as cobalt, molybdenum,
  nickel, and silicon, on the deformation and fracture behavior of Armco iron. The
  J-integral method was used to measure the ductile initiation fracture toughness
  (JIC) of the alloys. Cobalt significantly enhanced JIC, while molybdenum, nickel,
  and silicon had a negative effect. The results are explained by changes in the fracture
  mode, stress concentration, and sulfur segregation at grain boundaries.
