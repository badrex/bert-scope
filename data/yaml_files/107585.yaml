tldr: The author, Everard Home, describes the discovery of the ovum in the human uterus
  and its connection to impregnation. By examining a woman's uterus after her death,
  Home was able to identify the ovum and its development, providing new insights into
  the reproductive process. This discovery challenged previous theories about menstruation
  and conception, and helped to advance the understanding of human reproduction.
