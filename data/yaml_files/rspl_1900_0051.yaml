tldr: The author discovered the specific micro-organism responsible for distemper
  in dogs and developed a vaccine to prevent the deadly disease. The vaccine works
  similarly to those created for plague and enteric fever, offering protection to
  dogs and potentially other animals as well. Further research is needed to determine
  the exact duration of protection provided by the vaccine.
