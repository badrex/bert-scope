tldr: The authors conducted experiments with onium salts, including quaternary ammonium,
  phosphonium, arsonium, and sulphonium salts, to study their pharmacological properties
  and curariform activity. They found that larger cations with a specific range of
  ionic volume had "normal" curariform properties, while smaller or larger cations
  exhibited greater activity. The authors also discovered that ethyl groups do not
  inherently cause anomalous curariform properties and that ionic radius plays a role
  in determining activity. Finally, they compared the activity of strychnine and its
  quaternary salts, finding that strychnine methiodide is more active than any other
  quaternary salt they examined.
