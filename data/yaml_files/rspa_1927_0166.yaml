tldr: The authors conducted experiments on high-current fuse discharges, analyzing
  the spectra produced when wires are suddenly short-circuited. They observed shifts,
  reversals, broadenings, and absorptions in the spectra, which they studied using
  copper and iron wires. The results provide insights into the behavior of materials
  under high pressure and temperature conditions.
