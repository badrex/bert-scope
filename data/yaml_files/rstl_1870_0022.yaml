tldr: The author discusses the development of a logical machine that can perform the
  operations of logical inference. This machine is based on the work of George Boole,
  who extended the principles of logic and made it possible to create a system of
  deduction that can be embodied in a mechanical device. The author believes that
  this machine will revolutionize the field of logic and make it more accessible to
  a wider audience.
