tldr: The author, Paul Cooper, explores the connection between refracted and diffracted
  light. He demonstrates that white refracted light is formed by the superposition
  of fringes of colors or rays of light that compensate each other. Diffracted white
  light is also formed by the superposition of fringes that are not uniformly refracted
  but still maintain mutual compensation. The purity of the light's color in both
  cases depends on its continuity, and any interruption can produce colors in its
  further progress.
