tldr: The author examines the law of darkening of a stellar disc towards the limb
  and its relation to the spectral energy curve of a star. They discuss the effects
  of scattering and the solar spectrum, and explore different types of darkening predicted
  by theory for stars of varying temperatures and atmospheric compositions. The study
  also investigates the deductions that can be made about a star if its law of darkening
  is given.
