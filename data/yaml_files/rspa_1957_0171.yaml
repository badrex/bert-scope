tldr: The authors studied the fatigue behavior of silver chloride and observed that
  fatigue cracks travel along grain boundaries. They found that dislocations can climb
  away from obstacles on slip planes, leading to the formation of dislocation substructures.
  The fatigue experiments suggest that most of the fatigue life is concerned with
  crack propagation rather than crack formation.
