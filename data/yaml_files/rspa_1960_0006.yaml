tldr: This article investigates the reflexion of radio waves from a stratified ionosphere
  affected by weak irregularities. The authors explore the resonance possibility and
  provide estimates for the reflexion level enhancement. They also discuss the phenomenon
  of'spread' and its impact on the scattered wave below the ionosphere.
