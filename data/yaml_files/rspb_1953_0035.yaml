tldr: The authors investigate the structure of plant nuclei in Vicia faba, Allium
  Cepa, and Zea mays using various staining methods and ultraviolet microscopy. They
  discover distinct zones within the nucleus, including a peripheral zone, a middle
  zone, and a nucleolus with an outer region and an inner core. The study suggests
  that the middle zone and nucleolar core are not artifacts and may contain proteins
  and ribonucleic acids.
