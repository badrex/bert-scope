tldr: The author, Anthony van Leeuwenhoek, observed and described the structure and
  reproduction of muscles through a microscope. He discovered the presence of numerous
  moving particles within muscle membranes and found that muscles lay their eggs on
  their shells. He also examined the ovaries and the unborn muscles within them, as
  well as the gut contents of muscles, which contained sand and other particles. This
  research provided valuable insights into muscle anatomy and reproduction.
