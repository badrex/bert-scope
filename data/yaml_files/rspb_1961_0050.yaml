tldr: The authors discovered that penicillin amidase, an enzyme found in various microorganisms,
  can hydrolyze different types of penicillin to form 6-aminopenicillanic acid. They
  found that Streptomyces lavendulae produced an exocellular penicillin amidase that
  effectively hydrolyzed phenoxymethylpenicillin. This discovery led to the development
  of more efficient methods for producing 6-aminopenicillanic acid, a key component
  in the synthesis of various penicillin derivatives.
