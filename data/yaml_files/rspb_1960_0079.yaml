tldr: This article discusses the distribution of plants in the southern cold temperature
  zone and presents evidence for continental drift and polar wandering. The authors
  analyze plant distribution patterns and geological evidence to support the theory
  of continental drift, which explains the connections between South America, Antarctica,
  and Australia in the past. They also consider the impact of Pleistocene coolings
  on plant distributions.
