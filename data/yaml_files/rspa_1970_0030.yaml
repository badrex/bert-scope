tldr: This article investigates trapped holes and excitons in alkaline earth fluorides
  using electron paramagnetic resonance and optical absorption spectra. The authors
  study the self-trapped hole centers and other hole center types, including the center
  involving interstitial fluorine ions. They also discuss the kinetics of reorientation
  and decay of these centers and the properties of hole centers in alkaline earth
  fluorides.
