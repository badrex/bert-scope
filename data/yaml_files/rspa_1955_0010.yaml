tldr: The article explores the finite elastic deformation, extension, inflation, and
  torsion of compressible isotropic bodies, providing formulas for stress and strain-energy
  functions. It also examines the symmetrical inflation of an isotropic spherical
  shell and the conditions for eversion. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of material behavior under various deformations.
