tldr: The author, William Withering, examines the properties of the Terra Ponderosa,
  a heavy mineral substance found in a lead mine. Through a series of experiments,
  he discovers that the substance contains a large proportion of the terra ponderosa
  united to fixed air. Withering also explores the reactions between the Terra Ponderosa
  and various acids and alkalis, and discusses its potential applications in chemical
  inquiries. His findings contribute to the understanding of the composition and properties
  of this unique mineral.
