tldr: The study investigates the chemoautotrophic symbiosis in the gills of the bivalve
  mollusc Lucinoma borealis and the sediment chemistry of its habitat. The bivalve
  hosts specialized cells containing prokaryotes that can oxidize reduced sulfur species,
  allowing them to survive in environments with low levels of dissolved sulfur. The
  bivalves may obtain half their carbon from these autotrophic prokaryotes.
