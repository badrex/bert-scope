tldr: Sir Everard Home discovered the ovum in the human uterus, providing insights
  into ovum formation and impregnation. He disproved the notion that the corpus luteum
  is the effect of impregnation and showed it to be a glandular structure where the
  ovum is formed. The study also revealed that ova pass into the uterus during the
  state of virginity and that impregnation can occur even without the presence of
  the male.
