  human remains found there. He explains the circumstances of the discovery and the
  contemporaneity of the human remains with those of extinct animals and flint and
  bone implements. The author also discusses the cranium, jaws, and teeth of the individuals
  found in the cavern, comparing them to different types of human skulls and races.
