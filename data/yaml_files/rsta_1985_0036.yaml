tldr: This study investigates the geochemistry of buried sediments in the North Sea
  Jurassic, focusing on the reduction and prediction of sandstone reservoir potential.
  The research analyzes porosity-depth and porosity-permeability relations in two
  Jurassic sandstone sequences (A and B) and concludes that the present reservoir
  quality is a product of burial and reactions between evolving pore fluids and minerals
  in the sandstone.
