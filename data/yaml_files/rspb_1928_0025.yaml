tldr: Researchers conducted gonad cross-transplantation experiments in domestic fowl
  to study the relationship between gonadic structure and plumage characteristics.
  The results showed that testicular secretions influence the growth of head furnishings
  and sex instincts, while plumage is determined by genetic factors. This study provides
  insights into the complex interplay between reproductive organs and plumage development
  in domestic fowl.
