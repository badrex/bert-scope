tldr: This article discusses the evolution of the Precambrian crust in Greenland,
  focusing on the tectonic displacements and thermal activity in the Nagssugtoqidian
  and Ketilidian mobile belts. The authors compare these Proterozoic mobile belts
  to modern counterparts, analyzing the tectonic displacements and thermal activity
  within the belts. The Nagssugtoqidian mobile belt is characterized by considerable
  crustal shortening, limited igneous activity, and high-pressure regional metamorphism,
  while the Ketilidian mobile belt has limited crustal shortening but significant
  vertical and transcurrent movements.
