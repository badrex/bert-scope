tldr: The author conducted crystallographic studies on sulphonates in the benzene
  series, focusing on the relationship between molecular structure and isomorphism.
  They examined various salts, including dichloro- and dibromobenzenesulphonates,
  and found that the structures of these salts were closely related, providing evidence
  for the mutual displacement of metals and halogens in the salts.
