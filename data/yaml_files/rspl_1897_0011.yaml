tldr: This article presents a study on the luminosity and photometry of the spectrum.
  The author used various methods, including the "minimal effective stimulus" and
  flicker photometry, to determine the potency of different parts of the spectrum.
  The results showed that the green part of the spectrum was the most potent when
  the eye was dark adapted, while the yellow was the most potent when the eye was
  light adapted. The study also discussed the nature of the flicker effect and compared
  the results obtained using different methods.
