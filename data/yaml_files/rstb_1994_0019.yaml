tldr: This article presents a theory for the dynamics of sparse associative memory
  applied to the pyramidal recurrent network in the hippocampus. The CA3 region is
  modeled as a network of pyramidal neurons connected through their recurrent collaterals,
  with inhibitory interneurons regulating the membrane potentials. The theory considers
  the storage of memories, recall process, and the role of inhibitory interneurons
  in the hippocampal network.
