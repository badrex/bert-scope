tldr: The author investigates the composition of soap films and discovers that they
  contain acid sodium soap, not free oleic acid as previously thought. The accumulation
  of this soap in the surface is influenced by the nature of the soap solution, with
  the highest accumulation occurring in solutions with an excess of either oleic acid
  or alkali. The author also concludes that the structural basis of the black spots
  in soap films is an acid sodium soap.
