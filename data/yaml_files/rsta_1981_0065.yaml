tldr: This article examines the geochemistry and timing of marginal basin and arc
  magmatism in the Philippine Sea. It identifies three periods of back-arc crustal
  generation and three pulses of volcanic activity along the associated island arcs.
  The geochemistry of basalts from the back-arc basins indicates that they are similar
  to mid-ocean ridge basalts, while the island arc rocks have variable compositions.
  The study provides important constraints on models of magmatism and extensional
  tectonics at convergent plate boundaries.
