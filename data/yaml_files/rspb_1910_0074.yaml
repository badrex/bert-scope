tldr: The authors successfully isolated and grew the lepra bacillus, a bacterium responsible
  for leprosy, using a special medium containing extracts of tubercle bacilli. This
  breakthrough could potentially lead to the development of a vaccine for treating
  leprosy. The researchers also isolated and grew the acid-fast bacillus found in
  cows with Johne's disease, with plans to develop a diagnostic vaccine in the future.
