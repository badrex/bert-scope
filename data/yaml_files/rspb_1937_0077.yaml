revised_title: Innovative Techniques for Measuring Muscle Heat Production
scientific_discipline: Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology
semantic_tags:

tldr: The authors developed thin, rapid-response thermopiles to measure the heat production
  of muscles accurately. They analyzed the temperature distribution and heat flow
  in muscle and thermopile systems, providing a better understanding of muscle physiology
  and improving experimental methods. This research has implications for studying
  muscle function and performance.
