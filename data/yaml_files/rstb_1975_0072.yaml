semantic_tags:

- Binding site interactions
tldr: This article discusses the physics and chemistry of biological recognition,
  focusing on enzyme-substrate interactions and the role of binding sites in enzyme
  catalysis. The author explains how enzymes bind to substrates in an intermediate
  state of the reaction, reducing the activation energy and accelerating the reaction.
  The article also explores the importance of proximity and entropy in enzyme catalysis
  and the role of the charge relay system in the trypsin family of enzymes.
