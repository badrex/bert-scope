tldr: The author, George Busk, presents a method for graphically representing the
  dimensions and proportions of mammal teeth, called "odontograms." This method uses
  horizontal lines to represent each tooth, with the length and breadth of each tooth
  indicated by lighter and darker shades. By connecting the points with straight lines,
  a figure is created that can be used for comparison and identification of species
  and genera. This method is useful for both zoologists and paleontologists.
