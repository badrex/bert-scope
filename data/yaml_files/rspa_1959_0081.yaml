tldr: The authors develop the properties of linear visco-elastic materials by hypothesizing
  that their microscopic structure is mechanically equivalent to a network of elastic
  and viscous elements. They derive expressions for stored energy and the rate of
  dissipation of energy for any material element at any time. The study focuses on
  isotropic materials, and the authors show that the stress-strain law can be expressed
  in operational form. They also demonstrate that models consisting of Voigt elements
  in series or Maxwell elements in parallel can represent the mechanical properties
  and stored and dissipated energies of any visco-elastic material.
