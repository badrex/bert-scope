tldr: This article explores the chaotic behavior in electronic circuits caused by
  nonlinear oscillations and overflow in digital filters. It discusses the complex
  dynamics of these oscillations and their potential applications. The study focuses
  on the effects of finite-wordlength and overflow nonlinearity in digital filters,
  which can result in oscillations and deviations from ideal behavior.
