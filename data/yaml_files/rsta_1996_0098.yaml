tldr: The authors extend information theory to assess the visual communication channel
  by uniting electro-optical design with digital image processing. They introduce
  six figures of merit to evaluate the performance of image gathering, coding, and
  restoration, aiming to produce the best possible picture at the lowest data rate.
  This approach considers critical limiting factors such as spatial frequency response,
  sampling, and reconstruction noises, leading to improved visual communication.
