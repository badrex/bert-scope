tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to determine if the velocity of
  light is affected by the presence of moving matter. They used various methods, such
  as rotating steel disks and a massive iron lump, and observed the light through
  interference fringes. The results showed that the velocity of light was not appreciably
  affected, suggesting that there is no significant mechanical connection between
  ether and matter.
