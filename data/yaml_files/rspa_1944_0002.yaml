tldr: This article presents a matrix theory to study correlations in lattice systems,
  focusing on crystalline structures. The author reduces the statistical mechanics
  of these systems to statistical correlations between unit cells in a fictitious
  lattice. By adjusting the mean probability coefficients of the cells, the correlations
  in a chain can be accounted for, and the thermodynamical energy can be calculated
  as a function of temperature.
