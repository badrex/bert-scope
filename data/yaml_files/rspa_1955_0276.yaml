tldr: This article explores the effect of friction on the propagation of tidal waves
  and surges in estuaries. The author presents formulae that consider the impact of
  cross-section contraction, estuary shallowness, and bed friction on these waves.
  The findings can be applied to understand and predict the behavior of tides and
  surges in estuaries, such as the Thames Estuary.
