tldr: The article explores the sustained feedback effects of L-horizontal cells on
  turtle cones. Prolonged peripheral light stimulation induces diverse sustained feedback
  effects, including complex long depolarizations, prolonged increases in electrical
  excitability, and sustained oscillations. These effects are blocked by cone hyperpolarization
  and Ca2+ channel-blocking agents and are associated with an increase in membrane
  Ca2+ conductance. The study demonstrates that the feedback effects of L-horizontal
  cells on cones are not only transient but also sustained.
