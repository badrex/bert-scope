tldr: The authors investigated the cathodic combustion of dry carbonic oxide detonating
  gas in electric discharges. They found that carbonic oxide can be directly burnt
  by oxygen without the intervention of moisture or metal atoms. Metal atoms and electrically
  charged moisture promote combustion by overcoming the electrostatic forces of repulsion
  between charged ions of carbonic oxide and oxygen. This study provides insights
  into the factors affecting gaseous combustion and the role of moisture in the process.
