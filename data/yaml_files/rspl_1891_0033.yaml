tldr: The author discusses the importance of using well-annealed and homogeneous glass
  for telescope mirrors. They explain that poor annealing can cause defects in the
  mirror's surface, leading to poor image quality. The author shares their experience
  with two mirrors, one with defects and one without, and concludes that a perfect
  surface of revolution can only be achieved with good quality glass.
