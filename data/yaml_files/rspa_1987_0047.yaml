tldr: The author presents a new statistical distribution function for fracture toughness,
  which is based on the circumstances occurring at the tips of sharp cracks. This
  function provides better fits to consistent sets of toughness data from metals and
  ceramics compared to the three-parameter Weibull distribution function. The new
  distribution function considers the inhomogeneity in the material and the dependence
  of yield stress and Young's modulus on temperature.
