tldr: The author discusses the importance of understanding the relationship between
  nervous and muscular structures in living and dead conditions. They emphasize that
  once this relationship is established, the phenomena of muscular movement can be
  better understood through experimental inquiry. The Royal Society's annual meeting
  for electing new fellows is also mentioned, with a list of newly elected members.
