tldr: The author presents a mathematical analysis of the dynamics of elastic spheroidal
  shells and spheroids filled with incompressible liquid. They develop equations to
  describe the behavior of these structures under various conditions and provide solutions
  for specific cases. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of
  solid materials and fluid-filled structures in engineering and physics.
