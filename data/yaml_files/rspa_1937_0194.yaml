tldr: The authors investigated the effect of temperature change on the elastic force
  of a stretched muscle. They concluded that the elastic system of muscle consists
  of flexible, primary-valence chain molecules that become ordered when stretched
  and return to a random arrangement with thermal agitation. The elastic force increases
  more rapidly at intermediate elongations, and latent heat is set free during stretching.
  X-ray studies support the molecular interpretation of the muscle's viscous-elastic
  properties.
