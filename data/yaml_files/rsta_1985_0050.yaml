tldr: This article discusses the theory and application of solitons in optical fibers
  and the soliton laser. It explains how solitons can be created and are stable in
  single-mode fibers, leading to various potential uses, such as in mode-locked lasers.
  The author describes the process of self-phase modulation and the nonlinear Schr√∂dinger
  equation, which governs soliton behavior. The article also presents experimental
  verification of soliton effects and the use of color-center lasers for generating
  solitons in optical fibers.
