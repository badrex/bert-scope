tldr: This article discusses the environmental and evolutionary changes that occurred
  during the late Silurian and early Devonian period, around 400 million years ago.
  The Iapetus Ocean's closure led to the formation of high mountain ranges and extensive
  land areas, creating diverse habitats and influencing the migration and adaptation
  of plants and animals. The article explores the use of fossils, palaeomagnetism,
  and palaeobiogeography to understand the geography and environment of the time,
  as well as the transition from marine to non-marine conditions and the colonization
  of terrestrial environments by plants and animals.
