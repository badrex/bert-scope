tldr: The article discusses the Autokon system, a computer-aided design and numerical
  control system used in the shipbuilding industry. The system uses a data bank concept,
  Autokon language, and design rules to streamline the design and engineering process,
  reducing the amount of specifications needed and increasing efficiency. The second
  generation Autokon is a semi-automatic solution that maintains human control while
  utilizing the computer for routine tasks.
