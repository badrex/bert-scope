tldr: The authors studied the infra-red absorption spectrum of methylene chloride,
  a widely used solvent, and discovered 26 absorption bands, 16 of which are new.
  They found that the strongest absorption band has no counterpart in the Raman spectrum,
  which led to a detailed discussion of the fundamental frequencies of the molecule.
