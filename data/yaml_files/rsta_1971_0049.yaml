tldr: This article discusses the impact of buildings on air pollution levels in urban
  areas. It explores the role of buildings in enhancing the dispersion of pollutants
  and the use of wind tunnel studies to estimate gas concentration distributions around
  building complexes. The author also addresses the need for further research on the
  effects of air pollution on human health, the environment, and the local climate.
