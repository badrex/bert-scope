tldr: This obituary highlights the life and scientific achievements of Gabriel Lippmann,
  who made significant contributions to electro-capillarity, color photography, the
  coelostat, pendulum clocks, and the isostacy of the earth's crust. Lippmann's work
  in color photography led to the development of a process that could reproduce colors
  accurately through photography, while his coelostat invention allowed for extended
  photographic exposure of a stationary area in the sky.
