tldr: The authors studied the electrolytic behavior of thin films and the areas of
  catalytically active surfaces. They measured the accessible area of various surfaces,
  including silver, mercury, and platinum, by observing the quantity of hydrogen deposited
  on the cathode. The results showed that the catalytic activity of silver atoms is
  several thousand times that of mercury, and the presence of relatively few platinum
  atoms on a mercury surface greatly increases the activity. The authors also investigated
  the effect of different treatments, such as activation, annealing, rolling, and
  electroplating, on the area and catalytic activity of metals.
