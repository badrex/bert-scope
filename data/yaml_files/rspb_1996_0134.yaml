tldr: This study examines the impact of the mermithid nematode Gasteromermis sp. on
  the mayfly host Baetis bicaudatus. The parasite causes morphological and behavioral
  changes in infected mayflies, including sex reversal, altering their external appearance
  and behavior. The research uses flow cytometry to determine the genetic sex of infected
  individuals, revealing that both male and female mayflies are affected by the parasite.
  The study suggests that these changes are an adaptive strategy for the parasite
  to ensure upstream dispersal, return to water for the completion of its life cycle,
  and maximum use of host nutrients.
