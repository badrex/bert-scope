tldr: The article discusses the use of recombinant DNA methods for diagnosing human
  heritable defects. It explores various techniques, such as restriction fragment
  length polymorphisms (RFLPs), allele-specific oligonucleotides (ASOs), and the polymerase
  chain reaction (PCR), to detect gene mutations and improve disease diagnosis. The
  author also highlights the potential of these methods for carrier detection and
  prenatal diagnosis.
