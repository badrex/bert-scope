tldr: The author investigates the decomposition of alkaline peroxides and the effects
  of oxidation caused by them. They demonstrate that these decompositions follow the
  normal law of chemical action and are not subject to any special hypothesis. The
  author also examines the catalytic decomposition of peroxides and the role of oxidation
  and reduction in this process.
