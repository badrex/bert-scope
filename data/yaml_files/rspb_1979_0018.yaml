tldr: 'This article discusses the regulation of numbers of intracellular algae in
  aquatic invertebrates, focusing on three possible mechanisms: expulsion of excess
  cells, inhibition of algal growth by the host, and digestion of algal symbionts.
  The study examines various algae-invertebrate associations, including Hydra viridis
  and Paramecium bursaria with Chlorella sp., and Anthozoa with symbiotic dinoflagellates,
  to understand the cellular interactions and stability of these associations.'
