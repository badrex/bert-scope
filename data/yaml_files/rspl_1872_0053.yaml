tldr: J.H. Gladstone and Alfred Tribe discovered a peculiar galvanic reaction involving
  copper and silver plates immersed in a solution of copper nitrate with oxygen. This
  reaction led to the formation of an air-battery, which demonstrated the importance
  of dissolved oxygen in the process. The authors also investigated the factors affecting
  the battery's performance, such as the strength of the copper nitrate solution and
  the proportion of metallic surfaces.
