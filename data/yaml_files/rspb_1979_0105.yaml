tldr: The study examines the effects of sleep on neurons in isolated cerebral cortex.
  It found that the interval distributions of neurons in isolated cortex resembled
  those in the intact cortex of an alarmed animal. When an animal falls asleep, there
  is no significant alteration in the modal interval or geometric standard deviation
  of interval distributions recorded from cells in isolated cortex. This suggests
  that the reduction of modal interval in intact cortex during sleep is probably due
  to neural influences from infracortical structures.
