tldr: The author examines the skulls of early Tertiary Suidae and Artiodactyls, focusing
  on the basicranial characters to understand their relationships and evolutionary
  history. By comparing the skull structures, the author provides insights into the
  divergence of peccaries from true pigs and the classification of these mammals.
