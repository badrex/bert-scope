tldr: The authors determined the piezo-electric moduli of ammonium seignette salt,
  a crystal with three two-fold symmetry axes. They found that the piezo-electric
  properties of the crystal are associated with pressures and the moments are parallel
  to specific axes. The study provides insights into the piezo-electric properties
  of crystals and their applications in various fields.
