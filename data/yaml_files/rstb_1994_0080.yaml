tldr: The article discusses the molecular evolution of serine protease and its inhibitor,
  focusing on the dynamic changes and independent evolution of functional domains.
  The authors propose that these domains may have been ancestral minigenes and that
  studying the DNA sequence database can help identify the minimum set of these ancestral
  genes necessary for maintaining life forms.
