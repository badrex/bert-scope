tldr: Eccles and Jaeger investigate the relationship between the mode of operation
  and the dimensions of junctional regions at synapses and motor end-organs. They
  find that the size of the junctional regions is related to the type of operation,
  providing insights into the functioning of these structures in the nervous system.
