tldr: The authors present advancements in perturbation theory for small disturbances
  in stationary systems. They demonstrate that the total, kinetic, and potential energies
  can be obtained to the order from a knowledge of only the -order wave function.
  They also suggest a combination of variational and perturbation methods as the best
  approach for calculating small disturbances. The authors apply these methods to
  various problems and discuss their results.
