tldr: The authors present a study on optimally scalable matrices, focusing on various
  concepts, properties, and applications. They explore different types of scaling
  methods, such as side-wise scaling, checkerboard scaling, and more. The study also
  discusses the relationship between dual norms and their applications, providing
  a comprehensive understanding of matrix theory and its practical implications.
