tldr: 'The author, Thomas Williams, studied the nutrient fluids in invertebrate animals
  and discovered two distinct types: blood-proper and chylo-aqueous fluid. These fluids
  have different systems, conduits, and functions within the organisms. The author
  also found that the presence and development of these fluids are inversely proportional
  in different classes of invertebrates. This research helps establish a better understanding
  of the classification and characteristics of invertebrate animals.'
