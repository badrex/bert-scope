tldr: This article discusses the evolution and extinction of tetrapods, focusing on
  the quality and incompleteness of the fossil record. It examines the factors affecting
  preservation and the challenges in assessing the fossil record's completeness. The
  study highlights the importance of understanding the incompleteness of the fossil
  record to improve macroevolutionary studies and test hypotheses related to mass
  extinctions.
