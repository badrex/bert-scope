tldr: In 1666, Monsieur Bullialdus observed the Nebulosa star in the Andromeda galaxy
  and the wondrous star in the Neck of the Whale. He reported that the Nebulosa star
  appeared to grow brighter and larger over time. The observations were made difficult
  by cloudy weather and the brightness of the stars. Bullialdus also mentioned receiving
  a letter from Hevelius, who had a different hypothesis about these stars.
