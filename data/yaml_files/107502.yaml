tldr: The author observed the peculiarities of tides between Fairleigh and the North
  Foreland and explained the supposed meeting of tides near Dungeness. The author
  found that the great contraction of the channel between Dungeness and Cape D'Alpree
  causes the tides to accumulate, leading to higher tides in the area. This phenomenon
  is due to the resistance to the tidal flow caused by the sudden narrowing of the
  channel, which results in the formation of two large natural basins or reservoirs
  at each end of the straits.
