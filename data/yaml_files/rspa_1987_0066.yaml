tldr: The article presents new expressions for the acoustic field produced when a
  plane-wave source of sound is diffracted by a soft, hard, or mixed soft-hard wedge
  whose angle can be expressed as a rational multiple. The solution is expressed in
  terms of geometrical acoustic source terms and real integrals representing the diffracted
  field, allowing for easy calculation of the acoustic field and providing a uniform
  valid expression for the far field.
