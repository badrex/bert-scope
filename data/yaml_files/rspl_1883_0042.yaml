tldr: This article investigates the effects of temperature on the performance of secondary
  batteries, specifically on the electromotive force and internal resistance. The
  author finds that the electromotive force remains constant across varying temperatures,
  while the internal resistance decreases as the temperature increases and increases
  again as the temperature decreases. The study also shows that the effect of varying
  the percentage of acid in solution is not very marked.
