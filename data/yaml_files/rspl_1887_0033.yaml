tldr: The author, Captain W. de W. Abney, studied the transmission of sunlight through
  Earth's atmosphere and its effects on photographic sensitivity. He found that the
  atmosphere's absorption and scattering properties can be accurately measured and
  calculated using a logarithmic formula. The author also discussed the suitability
  of high altitudes for observing different wavelengths of light, particularly in
  the visible spectrum, and the impact of atmospheric particles on light scattering.
