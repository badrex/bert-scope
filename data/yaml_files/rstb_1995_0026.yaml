tldr: This study investigates the impact of non-random survival during population
  crashes on genetic variation in Soay sheep. The researchers found associations between
  individual survival and certain genotypes at five polymorphic protein or microsatellite
  DNA loci. The results suggest that factors other than random survival during bottlenecks
  may help maintain genetic variation in natural populations.
