tldr: The article investigates the properties of endothelium related to capillary
  permeability using electron microscopy and introduces ferritin and saccharated iron
  oxide as electron-dense marker particles. The study examines the behavior of these
  particles in the endothelium of rat and mouse heart capillaries under various conditions,
  including different perfusion fluids and temperatures. The results show that particles
  enter caveolae and vesicles from the lumen, and some ferritin molecules seem to
  traverse the cell by the caveolae and vesicles. The study provides insights into
  the transport mechanisms of substances across the capillary wall.
