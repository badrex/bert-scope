tldr: The author discusses the potential and challenges of using enzymes in industrial
  and diagnostic applications. They highlight the advancements in genetic engineering
  and the range of organisms that can produce useful enzymes. The author also suggests
  that with the new techniques of site-directed mutagenesis, enzymes can be tailored
  to catalyze specific reactions and increase their stability. The meeting aimed to
  explore novel uses for these enzymes.
