tldr: The authors conducted experiments to measure the temperature variations of the
  viscosities of gases in the argon group. They used a modified apparatus to work
  at different temperatures and obtained interesting comparisons of the temperature
  variations of different gases. The results indicate that temperature variations
  of about one-third of a degree are detectable, and the collected results are given
  in a table for further analysis.
