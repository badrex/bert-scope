tldr: This article discusses the author's experiments on the effects of grooved surfaces
  on light. The author observed a series of periodical colors produced by the grooved
  surfaces of metallic and transparent bodies. These colors were found to be dependent
  on the number of grooves and intervals, and the angle of incidence. The author also
  analyzed the phenomena using homogeneous light, red light, and violet light, explaining
  the color deficiencies and providing tables of the angles of incidence. The study
  was conducted on various materials, including gold, silver, calcareous spar, tin,
  realgar, and isinglass.
