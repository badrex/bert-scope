tldr: The author describes the anatomy of a species of asteroid polyps, possibly belonging
  to a new genus of Alcyonidae. The polyps were found in the Conway Reef and have
  a unique structure with a trunk and branching extensions. The polyps' internal and
  external features, such as the investing membrane, muscular septa, and polyp-cells,
  are discussed in detail. The author also compares these polyps to Sarcodyction and
  notes their similarity in oral tentacula.
