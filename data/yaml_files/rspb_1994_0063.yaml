tldr: This study investigates how temperature affects the reproductive rates of male
  and female sand gobies. The results show that reproductive rates increase with temperature,
  but more so in males. This leads to a male-biased operational sex ratio, which can
  impact sexual selection and mating opportunities in the species. The research also
  provides insights into the capacity of male sand gobies to care for multiple clutches
  simultaneously.
