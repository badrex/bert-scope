tldr: The authors conducted a study on the ferromagnetic state in iron using neutron
  diffraction and spin fluctuation scattering. They found that the collective-electron
  theory of Slater and Stoner cannot be reconciled with the neutron scattering data,
  and that the actual state of affairs in iron is probably very close to what is described
  in the localized-electron model of Heisenberg and Bloch. This study provides fundamental
  data about magnetic electron states in iron.
