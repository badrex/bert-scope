tldr: The authors discovered that intravenous injections of diamino-acridine sulphate
  confer bactericidal properties on the blood, making it more effective against bacteria.
  This substance is enhanced in its bactericidal action by serum and is less toxic
  to mammalian tissues. Diamino-acridine sulphate has potential as a therapeutic substance
  for treating bacterial infections.
