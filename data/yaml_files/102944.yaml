tldr: This article describes the observations of solar and lunar eclipses made by
  Mr. Tho. Brattle in Cambridge, New England. The observations were used to determine
  the difference in longitude between Cambridge and London, which was crucial for
  accurate timekeeping and navigation. The author also discusses the use of early
  telescopes in making these observations.
