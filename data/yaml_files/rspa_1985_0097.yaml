tldr: This article presents a statistical theory of fracture in a two-phase brittle
  material, where a brittle matrix has a dispersion of tougher second-phase particles.
  The analysis considers the interaction between flaws and second-phase particles,
  and how stable cracks can form before final failure. The expected number of cracks
  at any stress level is calculated, and the statistical strength distribution for
  specimens under tension and bending is obtained.
