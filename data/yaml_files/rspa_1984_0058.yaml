tldr: This article investigates the inverse problem for vibrating beams with clamped-free
  conditions. The authors develop a model for the beam, analyze oscillatory matrices,
  and determine the eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the system. They also explore
  the forced response of the beam and provide a method for finding the system parameters
  from a knowledge of frequency spectra.
