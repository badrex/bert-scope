tldr: In this paper, Dr. Thomas Young explores the interference phenomena and color
  dispersion. He explains how the interference of two light portions, one reflected
  from a fiber and the other bending around its opposite side, creates colored fringes.
  He also discusses the colored halos surrounding a distant light source when looking
  through a lock of wool or water particles. Furthermore, he suggests that every refractive
  medium transmits light in two separate portions, which re-unite after each separation,
  leading to a more simple and satisfactory explanation of color dispersion by refraction.
