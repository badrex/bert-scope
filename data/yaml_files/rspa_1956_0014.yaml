tldr: The authors develop a general theory of incompressible plastic materials as
  a special case of Truesdell's theory of hypo-elasticity. They provide equations
  for a single loading followed by one unloading and focus on materials with a linear
  stress-logarithmic strain curve for unloading in simple extension. They discuss
  two special cases of the constitutive equations for loading, one of which is a generalization
  of Prager's suggestion, and apply these equations to various specific problems.
