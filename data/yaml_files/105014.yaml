tldr: In July 1750, a fire-ball was observed in the sky by multiple witnesses, including
  Mr. Wm. Smith. The fire-ball appeared to be the size of a large star, with a color
  similar to a rocket. It had a tail of light and moved horizontally at a slow speed.
  The phenomenon was seen in various locations, suggesting it was at a great height
  in the atmosphere.
