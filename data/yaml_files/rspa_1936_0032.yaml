tldr: The authors present a formula for calculating the force between two coaxial
  helices carrying current in any relative position. This formula takes into account
  the spiral nature of the helices and improves upon previous methods that assumed
  an axially symmetrical magnetic field. The formula is essential for accurate measurements
  of electric currents using a balance with helix-shaped coils.
