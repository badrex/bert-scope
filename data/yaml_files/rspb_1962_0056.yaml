tldr: The study investigates the behavior of colloidal carbon in the blood vessels
  of inflamed rat mesentery using electron microscopy. The results show that carbon
  accumulates in the walls of venules and passes through open intercellular junctions
  of the endothelium. The carbon is contained within the walls of venules by the basement
  membrane of the endothelium and the periendothelial sheath. This research provides
  insights into the mechanisms of inflammation and vascular permeability.
