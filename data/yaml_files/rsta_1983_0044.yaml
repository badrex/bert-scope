tldr: This article discusses the history and development of synthetic aperture radar
  (SAR) technology, focusing on its applications in observing ocean and land surfaces
  from satellites. It explains the principles behind SAR, its advantages and limitations,
  and the importance of system coherence and scene coherence in obtaining accurate
  images. The article also highlights the potential of SAR in measuring physical parameters
  of the Earth's surface, such as surface roughness, dielectric constant, and scene
  motion.
