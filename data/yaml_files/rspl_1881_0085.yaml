tldr: The author investigates the electromotive properties of the leaf of Dionaea
  in both excited and unexcited states. They describe the apparatus and methods used
  in their investigation and present experimental results related to the electrical
  phenomena of the plant. The study infers that the "cross difference" is an expression
  of electromotive forces in living protoplasm cells and is due to the contact of
  cells in different physiological activity states.
