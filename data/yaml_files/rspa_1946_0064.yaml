tldr: The authors investigated the free radical polymerization of vinyl chloride,
  acrylic nitrile, styrene, butadiene, and methyl isopropenyl ketone using methyl
  radicals from photo-decomposing acetone. They found that the ratio of the propagation
  to the termination coefficients for these polymerization reactions can be measured,
  providing a relative measure of a molecule's tendency to polymerize by a free radical
  mechanism. The study also showed that the rate of polymerization is proportional
  to the square root of the acetone pressure and the first power of the monomer pressure.
