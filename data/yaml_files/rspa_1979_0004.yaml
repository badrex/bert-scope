tldr: The authors modified an impact microviscometer to measure the ultimate shear
  stress of fluids at high pressures. They found that three tested fluids displayed
  non-Newtonian behavior and appeared to approach a limiting shear stress with increasing
  shear rate. The results suggest that fluids reach a point where they cannot sustain
  an equivalent increase in shear stress, indicating a potential limiting value of
  0.1 Pa for shear stress.
