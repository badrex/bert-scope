tldr: In this letter, Mr. Leewenhoek shares his microscopical observations on eels,
  mites, and figs. He discusses the reproduction and anatomy of eels, the different
  types of mites found on plants, and the presence of tiny animals inside figs. He
  also speculates on the possibility of hermaphroditism in eels and the potential
  origin of these mites.
