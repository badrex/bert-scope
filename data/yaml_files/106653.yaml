tldr: Joseph Priestley conducted experiments to study the composition of water and
  the principle of acidity. He discovered that when air is decomposed, a new acid
  is formed, which he identified as nitrous acid. This finding challenged the phlogiston
  theory and contributed to the understanding of chemical reactions and the composition
  of air.
