tldr: The article presents an X-ray analysis of the crystalline complex between trimethylplatinum
  and 4:6-dioxononane. The crystal structure reveals that the -diketone residues act
  as tridentate ligands in the dimeric molecules, providing the first examples of
  -diketones acting as bridges in polynuclear complexes and as tridentate groups.
  The structure is loosely packed with no van der Waals contacts less than 3.2 Ã… between
  dimeric molecules.
