tldr: This article describes a bomb calorimeter experiment to determine the heats
  of formation of nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide. The authors used an adiabatic
  calorimeter and explosion method to measure the heat reactions of various gas mixtures.
  The results confirmed the value of the heat of formation for nitrous oxide and provided
  a more accurate understanding of the reactions involved.
