tldr: The authors conducted experiments to produce a uniform stream of water in an
  open horizontal channel. They used a trumpet-shaped orifice to create a uniform
  velocity and depth in the channel. The experiments were successful in producing
  a stream with no measurable waves and good velocity distribution, which could be
  useful for testing ship models and observing phenomena like fixed bores and waves
  caused by obstructions.
