tldr: The author discusses the effects of digitalis on the cardiovascular system,
  particularly in cases of hemorrhage. They argue that digitalis may be beneficial
  in venous hemorrhages if it reduces arterial tension. The author also presents their
  theory on the role of muscular powers of arteries in the circulation and requests
  a fair consideration of their ideas.
