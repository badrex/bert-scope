tldr: The author describes a method to isolate secretin, a hormone responsible for
  stimulating pancreatic juice secretion, from the duodenal mucosa. Secretin is a
  polypeptide and is soluble in water and dilute alkali. It has no influence on blood
  sugar levels and is excreted in bile after intravenous injection of large doses.
  The hormone also stimulates bile secretion and diminishes urine secretion.
