tldr: 'The study investigates the mechanical design and properties of nacre, a material
  found in mollusk shells. Nacre is a platelet-reinforced composite filled with 95%
  calcium carbonate, which is a high filler content compared to man-made composites.
  The study measures and models three mechanical properties: the Young modulus, tensile
  strength, and fracture toughness of nacre. The results show that nacre has a high
  work of fracture and is remarkably strong and ductile, making it an ideal material
  for studying composite materials and their properties.'
