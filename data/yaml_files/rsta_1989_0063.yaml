tldr: This article discusses the potential of photonic switching technology for enhancing
  the performance of synchronous self-routing switching matrices in wideband local
  networks. The author examines the use of optical technology to address the challenges
  of switching and routing signals in networks handling a wide range of data rates
  and call-set-up times. The article also explores the role of optical interconnects
  and optoelectronic logic devices in improving the efficiency and speed of data processing
  in these networks.
