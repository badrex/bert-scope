tldr: Josiah Wedgwood attempts to connect his strong fire thermometer with the common
  mercurial one, aiming to create a uniform series of heat measurements. He uses the
  expansion of metals as a principle for an intermediate measure and develops a gage
  to measure the expansion and contraction of materials. The gage is made of a mixture
  of tobacco-pipe clay and charcoal, which allows for accurate measurements of heat
  and expansion.
