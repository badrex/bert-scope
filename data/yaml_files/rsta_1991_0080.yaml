tldr: The article discusses the results from the Large Electron Positron Collider
  at CERN, focusing on new particle searches and discoveries. The authors describe
  the principles, techniques, and results of these searches by the four collaborations.
  They explore indirect and direct searches for new particles, setting limits on their
  masses and discussing the search for quarks and leptons, Higgs bosons, and supersymmetry
  or compositeness. The article concludes that no evidence has been found for these
  particles, but the experiments have excluded the minimal Standard Model Higgs boson
  from zero mass to close to 50 GeV.
