tldr: The author examines the embryonic development and egg membranes in Monotremata
  and Marsupialia, comparing their processes to those of Placentalia. They describe
  the different stages of development, including the formation of the chorion, the
  role of the vitelline membrane, and the transformation of the egg membranes throughout
  the reproductive process. The author also discusses the similarities and differences
  in the segmentation and gastrulation of these species.
