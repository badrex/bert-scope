tldr: This article discusses the unique relationship between male butterflies of the
  Danainae and Ithomiinae subfamilies and plants containing 1,2-dehydropyrrolizidine
  alkaloids. These butterflies visit and feed on these plants to acquire alkaloid
  precursors that are later converted into chemicals used for courtship and territory
  marking. The study focuses on the 1971 Royal Society expedition to the New Hebrides,
  where researchers discovered that the plants attracting male Danainae contain the
  alkaloid lycopsamine, which is a precursor to the dihydropyrrolizine derivatives
  found on male butterflies' hairpencils.
