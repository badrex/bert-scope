tldr: The authors studied the growth kinetics of single crystal lamellae in polyisoprene
  melts using thin film electron microscopy. They found that the growth rate of lamellar
  crystals is independent of crystal length and depends on temperature and chemical
  composition of the polymer. The growth rate is highly sensitive to the presence
  of trans-units and crosslinks in the polymer, which affect the probability of secondary
  nucleus formation. This research provides insights into the factors governing crystallization
  rates in linear polymers with imperfections such as trans-units and crosslinks.
