tldr: Cephalopods, including squid, cuttlefish, and octopus, are active predators
  with a short lifespan and a single spawning event. They feed voraciously on a wide
  range of prey, allowing them to occupy a broad trophic niche and adapt to variable
  environments. Their impact on prey populations is highly seasonal and spatially
  variable, making them opportunistic in marine ecosystems. Cephalopods have unique
  morphological and behavioral adaptations that enable them to capture, handle, and
  consume various prey, making them important players in marine food webs.
