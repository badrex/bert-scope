tldr: This article presents a crystallographic framework and methodology for studying
  the symmetry of bicrystals, including grain and interphase boundaries. The authors
  introduce the concept of a dichromatic complex, which allows for the analysis of
  non-holosymmetric and non-symmorphic crystals. The study covers all possible bicrystal
  space groups and provides insights into the existence and interrelation of crystallographically
  equivalent variants of interfacial structures.
