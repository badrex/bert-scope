tldr: The author investigates the production of transient electric currents in iron
  and steel conductors when they are twisted while magnetized or when magnetized while
  twisted. These currents present interesting features and can be explained by reference
  to the effects of stress on magnetism. The study provides a useful supplement to
  direct investigations of magnetic susceptibility and residual magnetism.
