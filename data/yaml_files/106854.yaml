tldr: The author, J.A. de Luc, developed a new method for achieving extreme dryness
  in hygrometry using quicklime. He created an apparatus with a glass plate, a woven
  brass-wire cage, and a cylinder filled with quicklime. This method allowed for a
  fixed point of dryness, which was consistent even when using different sizes and
  shapes of apparatuses. The author's experiments showed that this method was effective
  in maintaining a steady degree of dryness, making it useful for studying hygrometry
  and meteorology.
