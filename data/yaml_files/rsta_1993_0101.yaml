tldr: The authors describe a new concept for synthesizing GaAs quantum wire and dot
  structures in an AlAs matrix using molecular beam epitaxy. They exploit the evolution
  of surface and interface structures on non-(100)-oriented GaAs substrates during
  epitaxy to create periodic arrays of macrosteps and facets, which form symmetric
  and asymmetric quantum-dot and wire arrays. The existence of lateral quantum-size
  effects in these structures is confirmed by reflection high-energy electron diffraction,
  atomic force microscopy, high-resolution electron microscopy, and distinct electronic
  properties.
