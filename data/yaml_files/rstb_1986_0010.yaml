tldr: The authors present a nomographic method to estimate the number of nucleotide
  substitutions in DNA sequences and the fraction of these substitutions that are
  transitions. This method corrects the bias in previous estimation methods and provides
  a more accurate understanding of the evolutionary process. The authors also discuss
  the limitations of the current models and suggest that part of the bias may arise
  from incorrectly assuming that all sites are variable.
