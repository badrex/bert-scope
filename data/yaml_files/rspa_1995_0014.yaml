tldr: This article explores the subharmonic dynamo action of fluid motions with two-dimensional
  periodicity. The authors analyze kinematic dynamos based on steady velocity fields
  and find that while the solutions of Roberts are usually the most efficient dynamos,
  there are cases where subharmonic dynamos are preferred. The study provides insights
  into the geodynamo and the behavior of magnetic fields in the liquid metallic cores
  of Earth and other planets.
