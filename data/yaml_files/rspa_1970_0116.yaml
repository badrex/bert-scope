tldr: The author presents a new approach to the classical theory of lattice dynamics,
  which corrects and expands upon previous methods. By introducing a new set of configuration-dependent
  potential functions, the author's approach better aligns with quantum theoretical
  results and provides a deeper understanding of atomic interactions in lattice systems.
