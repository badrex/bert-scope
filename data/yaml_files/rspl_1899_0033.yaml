tldr: The author, Captain W. de W. Abney, conducted experiments to determine the color
  sensations in terms of luminosity based on the Young theory. He found the positions
  in the spectrum for red, green, and blue sensations and used these to calculate
  the composition of white light. The study also involved matching colors to determine
  the luminosity of the three sensations and comparing the results with previous research.
