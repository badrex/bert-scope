tldr: The authors investigate the extrusion of liquid films trapped between a glass
  and a rubber surface, focusing on the friction and behavior of windscreen wiper
  blades. They study the viscosity and thickness of the liquid films, as well as the
  role of electrical double-layer repulsive forces in supporting the normal load.
  The findings provide insights into the design of windscreen wiper blades and the
  understanding of rubber-glass contacts.
