tldr: This article discusses the concept of the mind as an information-driven control
  system and explores the role of information in explaining the behavior of such systems.
  The author proposes that the statistical concept of mutual information from communication
  theory can be used to give semantic properties a role in explaining the behavior
  of information-driven control systems, such as the human mind and artificial intelligence.
