tldr: The author presents a method to represent the motion of a free rotating rigid
  body in both space and time using Poinsot's central ellipsoid. The author also demonstrates
  a dynamic relationship between the free rotating body and the ellipsoidal top, showing
  that their velocities remain in a constant ratio throughout the motion. Additionally,
  the author discusses the existence of two related disks that can be used to represent
  the motion of a free rotating body, reducing the distinction between the two comprehensive
  cases of the motion of a free rotating body.
