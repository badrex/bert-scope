tldr: The author, J. P. Gassiot, conducted experiments with voltaic batteries in carbonic
  acid vacua and observed the luminous discharge patterns. The experiments were performed
  using various vacuum tubes and batteries, including a water battery of 3520 cells,
  a 512 series of Daniell's constant battery, and a 400 series of Grove's nitric acid
  battery. The author discovered that the discharge from the water battery was continuous
  and could pass through the vacuum tubes, while the discharge from the other batteries
  was not as effective. The study also examined the effects of length and insulation
  on the discharge of electrical cables.
