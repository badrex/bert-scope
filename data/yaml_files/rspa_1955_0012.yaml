tldr: The authors apply the revised valence-bond theory to calculate the lower electron
  levels of cyclobutadiene and benzene. They demonstrate the practical feasibility
  of the method and compare the predictions and merits of molecular orbital and valence
  bond theories. The study supports the view that non-empirical calculations can be
  extended to systems involving more than a few electrons.
