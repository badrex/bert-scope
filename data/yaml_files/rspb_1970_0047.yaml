tldr: This article discusses the various ways hormones can control protein synthesis
  in cells. It explores different mechanisms, such as altering mRNA synthesis, ribosome
  activity, and degradation of mRNA. The author also presents alternative hypotheses
  for how hormones may affect protein synthesis, including the role of ribosome subunits
  and the possibility of hormonal control over mRNA transport and degradation.
