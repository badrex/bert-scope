tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the thermal conductivity of dielectric
  crystals, such as rutile, lithium fluoride, and potassium chloride, and found that
  the presence of multiple isotopes in the crystals can cause irregularities in atomic
  arrangement and lead to phonon scattering. They developed a theory explaining this
  effect and compared it with experimental results, showing satisfactory agreement.
