tldr: The authors used a static capacitor device to measure surface potential changes
  during oxygen chemisorption on clean nickel films. They found that oxygen doses
  added at higher temperatures cause a surface potential decrease, followed by a slow
  decrease due to oxygen incorporation into the metal lattice. The kinetics of the
  incorporation process were affected by the surface electric field formed by the
  oxygen-nickel double layer. The study provided insights into the degree of ionicity
  of the chemisorbed oxygen-nickel bond and the surface energy barrier that oxygen
  adatoms must overcome to be incorporated into the metal lattice.
