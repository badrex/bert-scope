tldr: Researchers have developed a new type of semiconductor laser called quantum
  cascade lasers, which operate in the mid-infrared range. These lasers are based
  on resonant tunnelling and can be tailored to emit light over a wide range of wavelengths
  using the same heterostructure material. High-power room temperature operation has
  been achieved at wavelengths of 5 and 8.5 µm, making them suitable for applications
  like environmental sensing and pollution monitoring.
