tldr: This article presents a systematic theory of successive approximations for both
  compressible and incompressible bodies in the context of elasticity. The authors
  focus on second-order effects in the deformation of elastic bodies, using tensor
  notation. They apply the theory to the problem of torsion in solids of revolution,
  specifically considering a cone made of incompressible material.
