tldr: This article discusses the nitrogen cycle and the role of biological nitrogen
  fixation in grassland production in the United Kingdom. It explores the symbiotic
  relationship between legumes, such as white clover, and grasses, and how this relationship
  impacts the amount of nitrogen fixed in the soil. The authors also examine the effects
  of fertilizer use on nitrogen fixation and suggest ways to encourage the retention
  of clover in grasslands.
