tldr: The author describes a new electrometer and its ability to detect and measure
  various types of electricity. The instrument consists of two slips of gold leaf
  suspended in a glass container, which can detect positive and negative charges.
  The author explains how different methods of electrification, such as using chalk,
  powders, and even weather phenomena like fog and rain, can affect the instrument.
  The electrometer's sensitivity can be increased by placing a candle on the cap,
  allowing it to detect electricity at greater distances.
