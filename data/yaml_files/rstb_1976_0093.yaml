tldr: The authors study the maturation process of the head of bacteriophage T4, focusing
  on the structural rearrangements and processing of its protein constituents. They
  find that the major head protein P23 undergoes cleavage, which leads to a structural
  rearrangement of the surface lattice. This process is essential for the maturation
  of the bacteriophage head, and the authors provide evidence that it is controlled
  by genes 21 and 24.
