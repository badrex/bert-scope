tldr: The study investigates the relationship between current reproductive effort
  and future reproductive success in blue tits. By delaying breeding attempts, researchers
  found that manipulated birds experienced reproductive costs in terms of decreased
  survival and lower subsequent reproductive success. The study suggests that time
  and/or energy constraints during moult could be the mechanism linking reproductive
  activities in one season to future reproductive success.
