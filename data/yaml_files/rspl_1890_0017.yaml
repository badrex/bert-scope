tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the passive state of iron and steel,
  focusing on the influence of magnetization on their passivity in nitric acid. The
  results showed that magnetization, even of low intensity, can modify the passivity
  of iron and steel, but does not entirely overcome it. The author also found that
  magnetization has a quicker effect on passivity at higher temperatures.
