tldr: The authors conducted a study on the magnetic and mechanical properties of manganese
  steel. They discovered that applying tension to the steel increased its magnetic
  intensity and found a correlation between the changes in length and the intensity
  of magnetization. The study also highlighted the importance of surface conditions
  and oxidation on the magnetic properties of the steel.
