tldr: This article discusses the water relations of plants, specifically the transport
  of water to plant roots in soil. It explores the factors affecting water flow to
  roots, such as soil properties, root structure, and the role of osmotic pressure.
  The authors also examine the challenges in understanding water uptake by roots and
  the impact of root age and suberization on water transport.
