tldr: The authors determined the absolute intensity of the vibration absorption band
  of nitrous oxide by measuring the integrated band area under conditions of complete
  pressure broadening caused by adding excess nitrogen. They correlated the intensity
  with the polar properties of the nitrogen-nitrogen and nitrogen-oxygen links and
  discussed the general relationship between integrated band area and total pressure.
  This study provides more information about the relationships involved when nitrous
  oxide's vibration bands are pressure-broadened by adding gases like nitrogen.
