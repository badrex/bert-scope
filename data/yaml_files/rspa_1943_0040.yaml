tldr: The authors conducted an X-ray analysis of cholesteryl iodide to determine its
  crystal structure and stereochemistry. They found that the crystal structure confirmed
  the general view of sterol crystallography and provided new evidence on the stereochemical
  relations of the sterol skeleton. The study also demonstrated the use of heavy atoms,
  like iodine, in working out the structure of complex organic molecules.
