tldr: The authors investigated the impact of air on the condensation of steam on cold
  surfaces, which has important practical implications for steam engine efficiency.
  They found that the presence of air significantly slows down the rate of condensation,
  affecting the efficiency of surface condensers and steam engines. The study also
  suggests that introducing air into the boiler of a high-pressure engine could prevent
  condensation at the surface of the cylinder, improving efficiency.
