tldr: The article discusses the application of subpicosecond optical techniques to
  study molecular dynamics using short laser pulses. The techniques extend time-resolved
  investigations into the subpicosecond regime, enabling accurate studies of photoprocesses
  in chemistry, physics, and biology. Examples of applications include the study of
  dye malachite green, azulene, and the photodissociation of dimethylaminophenylazide
  (DMPA).
