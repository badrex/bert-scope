tldr: The author examines the errors in longitude determination at sea using chronometers
  and identifies the impact of iron in ships on the accuracy of chronometers. The
  iron in ships creates a magnetic field that affects the balance of the chronometers,
  causing an acceleration in their rates. This discovery is crucial for improving
  the accuracy of longitude determination at sea.
