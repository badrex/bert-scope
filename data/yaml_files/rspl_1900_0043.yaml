tldr: In 1900, a team of astronomers led by W. H. M. Christie and F. W. Dyson observed
  the total solar eclipse in Ovar, Portugal. They took photographs of the corona and
  the spectrum of the "flash" during the eclipse. The observations provided valuable
  data for understanding the structure and behavior of the corona, as well as the
  relationship between coronal streamers and solar prominences.
