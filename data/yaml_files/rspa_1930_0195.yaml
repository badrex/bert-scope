tldr: The authors describe their experimental setup and methods for studying the infra-red
  region of the spectrum. They discuss the challenges faced due to the location of
  their lab and the measures taken to overcome them. They also provide details about
  the spectrometer, sources of radiation, and the potential errors in their measurements.
  This work contributes to the understanding of infra-red spectroscopy and its applications.
