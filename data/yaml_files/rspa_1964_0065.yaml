tldr: The article discusses the development of bubble-chamber techniques for research
  at high-energy proton synchrotrons, focusing on European contributions to the field
  at CERN. It describes the essential features of bubble-chambers, the production
  of homogeneous particle beams, and the analysis of the millions of stereo-pictures
  taken at CERN in the last two years. The article highlights the importance of international
  collaboration and the challenges faced in beam definition, data analysis, and automatic
  measurement of pictures.
