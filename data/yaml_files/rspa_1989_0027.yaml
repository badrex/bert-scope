tldr: The author analyzes the nonlinear Cahn-Hilliard equation to describe the later
  stages of phase separation in a chemical mixture. They use matched asymptotic expansions
  to study the behavior of the solution on different timescales, focusing on the internal
  structure of transition layers and the migration of fronts. The results provide
  insights into the dynamics of phase separation and the role of interface motion
  in the process.
