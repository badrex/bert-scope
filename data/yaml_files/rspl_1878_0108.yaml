tldr: This paper investigates the tidal distortion of a viscous spheroid, like the
  Earth, and its effects on the planet's geological history. The author finds that
  the distortion causes a slow rotation and a shift in longitude, which could have
  had an impact on the Earth's early history. The findings also suggest that the continents'
  wrinkles follow a specific pattern, and the distortion may have played a role in
  their formation.
