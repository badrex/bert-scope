tldr: The authors successfully isolated and identified hormonal granules in the neurohypophysis
  using differential centrifugation techniques. They found that these granules, which
  contain oxytocin and vasopressin, are mainly membrane-bounded with a diameter of
  about 1300 Å. The study provides insights into the storage and release mechanisms
  of hormones in the neurohypophysis.
