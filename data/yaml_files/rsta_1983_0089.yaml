revised_title: Einstein Gravitation as a Long Wavelength Effective Field Theory

tldr: The author proposes that Einstein gravitation is a long wavelength effective
  field theory rather than a fundamental theory. This idea is based on the concept
  of dimensional transmutation, where dimensional physical parameters are calculable
  in terms of a mass parameter. The author discusses the history and current status
  of this theory, as well as its implications for the unification of matter and gravitational
  theories.
