tldr: This article investigates the volumetric relations of ozone and the effects
  of electrical discharge on oxygen and other gases. The authors discovered that when
  oxygen turns into ozone, a significant condensation occurs, making it almost incompatible
  for ozone to exist as an allotropic form of oxygen in the gaseous state. The authors
  also found differences in the action between spark and glow discharges on various
  gases.
