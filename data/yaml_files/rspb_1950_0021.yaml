tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if ATP is broken down during
  muscle contraction and relaxation. They found that the ATP content of a muscle changes
  during the contraction-relaxation cycle, suggesting that ATP is indeed broken down
  during this process. This discovery is important for understanding the chemical
  basis of muscular activity and the role of ATP in muscle function.
