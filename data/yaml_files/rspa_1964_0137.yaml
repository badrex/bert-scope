tldr: The authors developed a method to improve the properties of pyrolytic graphite
  by applying stress recrystallization and hot-pressing techniques. This process aligns
  the crystalline structure and enhances the material's density, electrical and thermal
  conductivity, and other properties, making it suitable for studying the -axis transport
  properties of near-ideal graphite.
