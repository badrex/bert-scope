tldr: The author provides corrections to their previous paper on the steady motion
  and small vibrations of a hollow vortex. They discuss the stability of the core,
  the time of pulsation, and the equation for the times of vibration of a hollow ring.
  The author also addresses errors in the original paper, such as incorrect coefficients
  and the neglect of surface velocity effects.
