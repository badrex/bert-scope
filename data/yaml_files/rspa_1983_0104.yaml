tldr: The authors used a tunable diode laser spectrometer to measure the fundamental
  absorption band of the NF free radical in its 3Σ- ground state. They accurately
  calibrated the positions of fifty-one transitions in both P and R branches and analyzed
  the spectrum to determine molecular constants and equilibrium parameters. This study
  provides valuable information about the structure and properties of the NF radical,
  which is isoelectronic with O2.
