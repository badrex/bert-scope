tldr: The authors analyze the condensation theory of supersaturated vapours and criticize
  the assumptions made by Becker & Doring and Frenkel. They argue that these theories
  are only first approximations and should be improved to account for small molecular
  complexes. The authors also compare their findings with experimental data on critical
  supersaturations for water vapour and suggest that more measurements are needed
  for a better understanding of the phenomenon.
