revised_title: 'Thermal Explosion and Times to Ignition in Systems with Distributed
  Temperatures: IV. Behavior at Points of Criticality and Transition'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- Thermal explosion
- Times to ignition
- Distributed temperatures
- Criticality
- Transition
tldr: This article investigates the behavior of distributed temperature systems under
  critical conditions, focusing on the approach to critical and transitional steady-state
  profiles. The authors consider general reaction kinetics and arbitrary geometry
  and Biot numbers, providing a comprehensive analysis of the evolution in time for
  these systems.
