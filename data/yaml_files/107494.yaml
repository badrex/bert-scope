tldr: The author investigates the irregularities observed in compass needles of naval
  ships, specifically H.M.S. Isabella and Alexander, due to the attraction of iron
  contained within the ships. The study examines the effects of local attraction and
  how it corresponds with previous observations and rules for calculating corrections.
  The findings contribute to understanding and improving the accuracy of compass navigation
  in ships.
