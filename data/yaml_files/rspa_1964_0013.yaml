tldr: The article investigates a model of particle growth kinetics in a condensing
  system, where the mechanism is an irreversible chemical reaction at the particle-atmosphere
  interface. The author derives general growth laws for the assembly of particles
  and tests them against growth data on sulfur hydrosols. The study emphasizes the
  connection between the model and the pure birth process of mathematical statistics.
