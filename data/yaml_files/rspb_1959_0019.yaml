tldr: The article examines the rapid responses and motor innervation of Nereis and
  Harmothoe, two types of polychaete worms. The authors focus on the sensory and motor
  pathways, analyzing the giant fibres and their connections. They found that the
  rapid conduction pathways in these worms are similar to those in some arthropods.
  The study provides insights into the transmission of excitation from sensory cells
  to motor cells and muscle fibers in these organisms.
