tldr: The authors studied the structure of GaAs (001) surfaces during OMCVD growth
  and found that dimer formation occurs under various non-uhv conditions. They discovered
  that the surface structure varies with the supply rates of TMG and arsine and the
  substrate temperature. This research has significant implications for understanding
  surface processes in semiconductor manufacturing.
