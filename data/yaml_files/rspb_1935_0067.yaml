tldr: Researchers discovered a new alkaloid called ergometrine in ergot, which can
  cause strong contractions of the human uterus. Ergometrine is a white crystalline
  substance with unique properties, such as its solubility in certain solvents and
  its stability when combined with ethyl acetate. The researchers also found that
  ergometrine is related to other ergot alkaloids, such as ergotocin and ergobasine,
  but has distinct properties and uses in medicine, particularly in obstetrics.
