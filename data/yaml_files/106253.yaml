tldr: In this article, Sir George Shuckburgh discusses his experiments to determine
  the height of mountains using a barometer in Savoy. He examines and compares the
  methods of another scientist, Mr. De Luc, and provides a detailed account of his
  observations, measurements, and the instruments used. Shuckburgh's findings contribute
  to the understanding of the precision and accuracy of barometric measurements in
  determining the height of mountains.
