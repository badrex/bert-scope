tldr: The authors present photographic sequences of highly ionized gas clouds, or
  detonation-generated plasmas, emitted from the free surfaces of detonating explosives.
  They discuss the extrusion, compression, and expansion effects of these plasmas,
  as well as their associated shock patterns and conductivity-density relationships.
  The study reveals that detonation-generated plasmas are characteristic of detonation
  in all condensed high explosives and have a metallic-like character.
