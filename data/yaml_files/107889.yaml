tldr: The author, John Augustus Lloyd, conducted a series of levellings across the
  Isthmus of Panama to determine the relative height of the Pacific Ocean at Panama
  and the Atlantic Ocean at the mouth of the River Chagres. Using precise instruments
  and careful observations, Lloyd found that the high-water mark in the Pacific was
  3.55 feet higher than the high-water mark in the Atlantic. This study provided valuable
  information about the differences in ocean levels and tides on either side of the
  Isthmus.
