tldr: The authors analyze the heat flux from the Earth's surface using free convection
  and explain how it satisfies the theoretical law of free convection. They also discuss
  the role of wind and the different types of free convection, such as point, line,
  and plane elements. The study provides a better understanding of heat transfer in
  the Earth's surface layers and its implications for atmospheric science and environmental
  science.
