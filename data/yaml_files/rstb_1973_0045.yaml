tldr: This study examines the hereditary blood factors of Yemenite and Kurdish Jews,
  comparing their genetic differences and similarities. Blood specimens were collected
  from 75 Yemenite Jews and 121 Kurdish Jews, who were also subjected to various physiological
  tests. The gene frequencies show that these two Jewish populations differ significantly
  from one another, with the Yemenite Jews closely resembling Yemenite Arabs, while
  the Kurdish Jews have a higher incidence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency.
  The results provide valuable information for understanding the genetic makeup of
  these populations and their connections to other regional groups.
