tldr: This article explores the relationship between plant life histories and the
  composition of insect communities associated with them. It examines the evolution
  of insect host associations and how the composition of a component community affects
  plant evolution. The authors discuss the role of phylogenetic history and genetic
  constraints in determining a plant's insect fauna and the importance of understanding
  these relationships for the study of plant-insect interactions and coevolution.
