tldr: This study investigates rapid force-flux transitions in highly porous membranes,
  focusing on Nuclepore filters with uniform circular and parallel pores. The authors
  develop a quantitative theory that considers the membrane pores as independent capillaries
  lined with an electrical double layer and a diffuse counter charge in the pore solution.
  They analyze the pressure-driven and electro-osmotic flows and predict the observed
  types of transitions in fluxes and forces, providing a general understanding of
  the system's behavior. The study also presents a membrane cell design for testing
  the theory and compares observed and predicted current-voltage curves.
