tldr: This article reports the observation of both whole-beam and transverse optical
  bistability in thin uncoated cadmium sulphide (CdS) platelets at milliwatt power
  levels when a continuous wave laser is tuned near the band gap. The observed whole-beam
  bistability is thermally induced and can be relatively fast due to the high thermal
  conductivity of CdS at low temperatures. The transverse bistability measurements
  were made with larger samples immersed in superfluid helium, and very large transverse
  effects were observed in the far field.
