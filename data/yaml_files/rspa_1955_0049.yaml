tldr: The authors determined the absolute intensities of most of the infrared fundamental
  vibration bands of dimethyl acetylene and used these results to calculate polar
  properties of the C-H and C-C bonds. They found that if the acetylenic carbon atoms
  carry a residual negative charge, the hydrogen in the C-H bonds must carry a residual
  positive charge. The probable dipole moment is about 0.4 Debye, and the bond dipole
  moment is around 1 Debye. These findings provide insights into the chemical bonding
  and molecular vibrations of dimethyl acetylene.
