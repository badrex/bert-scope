tldr: The author investigates the infectivity of trypanosomes in Uganda fowls and
  their relation to T. gallinarum and T. gambiense. They discovered a crithidial type
  of flagellate in the mid-gut of Glossina palpalis, which is connected to T. gallinarum.
  The study also shows that Uganda fowls are not the normal host for this trypanosome,
  and Glossina palpalis is likely not a facultative host either.
