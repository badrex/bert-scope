tldr: This study investigates small nociceptive neurons in the superficial dorsal
  horn of the cat. The researchers found that these neurons have small fusiform cell
  bodies located around the border between laminae I and II. They also discovered
  that these neurons have a powerful inhibitory input from cutaneous mechanoreceptors
  and respond only to noxious stimulation. These cells form part of the population
  of small, selectively nociceptive, neurons in the superficial dorsal horn and show
  a variety of morphological types.
