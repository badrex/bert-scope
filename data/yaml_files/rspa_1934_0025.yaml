tldr: The authors used a camera with revolving lenses to study the development of
  lightning discharges. By comparing the images captured by the two lenses, they were
  able to determine the direction and speed of the developing discharge. The study
  found that 72% of the observed strokes had leader strokes, which are preliminary
  to the main strokes. This research provided valuable insights into the behavior
  of lightning and its impact on the environment.
