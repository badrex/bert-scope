tldr: The study investigates the effects of innervation and muscle activity on the
  development of skeletal muscles in rat embryos. By comparing muscles from embryos
  with destroyed motoneurons and chronically paralyzed muscles with normal embryos,
  the researchers found that the development of secondary myotubes, which form the
  majority of muscle cells in adults, is dependent on innervation. New muscle fibers
  cannot be generated without muscle contraction.
