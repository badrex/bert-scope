tldr: The author investigates the absorption spectra of cobalt salts and their reactions
  with various solvents and compounds. They discover that the spectrum of cobalt chloride
  changes depending on the solvent and concentration, and discuss the implications
  of these findings for the identification of cobalt compounds. The author also examines
  the spectra of other cobalt salts and their reactions with alkalies, and discusses
  the formation and properties of cobalt oxide.
