tldr: The article investigates the scattering of electromagnetic surface waves by
  circular or elliptic cylinders. It explores the reflexion and transmission of these
  waves when the width of the cylinder is small compared to other length scales. The
  study uses the method of matched asymptotic expansions to analyze the problem and
  calculate the reflexion, transmission constants, and directivity function. The findings
  can be applied to various scenarios involving electromagnetic wave scattering and
  surface waves.
