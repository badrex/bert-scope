tldr: This study investigates the development of resistance to the antibiotic sulphathiazole
  in Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus. The researchers found that the resistant
  strains have metabolic differences compared to sensitive strains, such as the accumulation
  of p-aminobenzoic acid and the synthesis of folic acid. The findings suggest that
  drugs and toxic agents can act as negative and positive catalysts, leading to the
  evolution of resistance mechanisms in living cells.
