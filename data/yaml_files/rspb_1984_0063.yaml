tldr: The study investigates the isoelectric forms, quaternary structure, and amino
  acid composition of peridinin-chlorophyll a-proteins from the symbiotic dinoflagellate
  Symbiodinium microadriaticum. The researchers found that the patterns of isoelectric
  forms remain unchanged under different light conditions. They also discovered that
  the differences in isoelectric forms are due to the proteins' quaternary structure
  and not their amino acid composition.
