tldr: The author, James Parsons, provides a detailed description of the Rana Piscatrix,
  a unique fish species found in Italy. He discusses its anatomy, including its teeth
  structure, head, and the two sacculi or marsupia on its sides. He also explains
  the fish's feeding behavior and how it allures other fish to approach. Parsons suggests
  that the sacculi may serve as a receptacle for the young until they are able to
  survive on their own. Lastly, he debates whether the Rana Piscatrix is oviparous
  or viviparous, as there is disagreement among authors on this topic.
