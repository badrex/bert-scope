tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the electrical conductivity of air
  and salt vapours and how it varies with temperature. They found that the current
  increases with temperature and that the energy required to ionize air and salt vapours
  is similar. This suggests that the ions involved in the process are of the same
  nature in both cases.
