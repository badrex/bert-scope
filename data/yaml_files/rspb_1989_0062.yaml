tldr: The article investigates the actions of the insecticide 2 (nitromethylene) tetrahydro-1,3-thiazine
  on insect and vertebrate nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The study finds that
  the compound inhibits the binding of [125I]a-bungarotoxin to insect and vertebrate
  membranes, indicating an agonist action at nicotinic acetylcholine receptors. The
  results suggest that nitromethylenes may be selective for acetylcholine receptors
  and have potential as safe and ecologically acceptable insecticides.
