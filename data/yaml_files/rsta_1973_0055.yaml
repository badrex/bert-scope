tldr: The article discusses earthquake fault studies in Japan, focusing on the off-Honshu
  tectonics. It reviews the measurement and interpretation of changes in strain, using
  observations from the south Kanto district. The author highlights the importance
  of geophysical instruments and geodetic surveys in monitoring crustal processes
  and understanding the mechanisms of stress transmission in tectonic units.
