tldr: This article presents a theoretical study of the surface photoelectric effect
  in metals. The authors, K. Mitchell and R. H. Fowler, discuss the interaction of
  electromagnetic radiation with metal surfaces and the resulting emission of electrons.
  They apply quantum mechanical principles to explain the observed phenomena and provide
  a deeper understanding of the underlying processes.
