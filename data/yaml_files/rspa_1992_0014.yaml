tldr: The authors prove that for maps with finite energy, the degree is an integer,
  and they obtain the existence of a minimizer of the energy in the natural class
  of maps with finite energy. This result is important for Skyrme's problem, which
  involves minimizing the energy of maps with a given integer degree.
