tldr: The article discusses the use of recombinant DNA technology in the prevention
  and diagnosis of genetic diseases, focusing on the prenatal diagnosis of hemoglobinopathies
  like sickle cell anemia, thalassemia, and their interactions. The authors describe
  the molecular pathology of these disorders, the role of restriction fragment length
  polymorphisms (RFLPs) in carrier detection, and the experience with fetal DNA analysis
  for prenatal diagnosis. They also highlight the importance of understanding phenotype-genotype
  relationships and the use of RFLPs in the diagnosis of genetic diseases.
