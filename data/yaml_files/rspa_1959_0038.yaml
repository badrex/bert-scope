tldr: The authors investigated the energetics of occlusion of argon and nitrogen in
  various ion-exchanged faujasite-type crystals. They found that the affinity and
  heat of intercalation for nitrogen were considerably higher than for argon. The
  crystals behaved as energetically homogeneous sorbents for certain cationic forms.
  The study provides insights into the role of dispersion, repulsion, polarization,
  and quadrupole interactions in the sorption process.
