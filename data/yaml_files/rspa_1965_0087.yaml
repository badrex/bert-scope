tldr: This article discusses the application of fracture mechanics to the damage and
  failure mechanisms of heavy-section steel. The author proposes a hypothesis that
  fracture initiation is governed by concentrated stress at the crack tip and crack
  opening displacement. The author also examines the effects of temperature, notch
  depth, and stress distribution on the fracture behavior of steel.
