tldr: John Macculloch, a significant figure in early geology, was the first geologist
  employed in government service in Britain. His geological map of Scotland was the
  first to be based on an official survey and published by a government. Macculloch
  also conducted various geological tasks, including finding suitable limestone for
  gunpowder mills and assisting in the Trigonometrical Survey. His work laid the foundation
  for modern geological mapping and understanding of Scotland's geology.
