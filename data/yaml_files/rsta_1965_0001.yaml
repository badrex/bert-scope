tldr: 'This study investigates the dry wear behavior of various steels under different
  loads, sliding speeds, and compositions. Two main types of transitions in wear processes
  are observed: a change from severe to mild wear, and a change from mild to severe
  wear. The findings provide a general pattern of wear behavior and help predict the
  circumstances in which these transitions might occur.'
