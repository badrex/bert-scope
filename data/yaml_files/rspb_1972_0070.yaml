tldr: This article discusses the concept of disruptive selection, which occurs when
  more than one phenotype has optimal fitness, and intermediate phenotypes have lower
  fitness. The author explains how disruptive selection can maintain multiple optima,
  and its relevance to the evolution and maintenance of polymorphisms and the divergence
  of populations under varying ecological conditions. The article also reviews experiments
  that demonstrate how disruptive selection can increase phenotypic and genetic variance,
  produce and maintain polymorphisms, and cause divergence between sub-populations
  with substantial gene exchange.
