tldr: The study investigates the spectral properties and photosensitivities of analogue
  photopigments regenerated with 10- and 14-substituted retinal analogues. The research
  compares the effects of substituents at position 10 and 14 in retinal analogues
  on the gecko's transmuted opsin and the rhodopsin of the midshipman fish. The results
  show that 14-substituted analogues have a red-shifted spectrum and similar sensitivity
  to light compared to the parent retinal analogues, while 10-substituted analogues
  have reduced spectral absorbance and photosensitivity. The study also highlights
  the differences in binding sites and responses to chloride between the two opsins.
