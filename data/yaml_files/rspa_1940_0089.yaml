tldr: The authors conducted experiments on single crystal metal points of tungsten,
  molybdenum, and nickel to study the distribution of autelectronic emission. They
  discovered that surface mobility occurs above 1170°C for tungsten, molybdenum, and
  nickel. The changes in emission distribution can be explained by the change in the
  geometrical shape of the point due to the action of the high external field on the
  mobile surface atoms. The authors also discussed the flash-over phenomenon in high
  vacuum and the effect of small traces of gas on the emission distribution.
