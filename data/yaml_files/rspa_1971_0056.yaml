tldr: This study investigates the thermal diffusion in binary gas mixtures of methane
  and nitrogen, and methane and carbon dioxide at elevated temperatures. The authors
  use the two-bulb method to measure thermal diffusion factors and apply classical
  kinetic theory to obtain precise values of binary diffusion coefficients. The results
  show that the magnitude of the separation is less than expected based on common
  intermolecular potential models, possibly due to inelastic collisions. The thermal
  diffusion factor for methane-nitrogen mixtures exhibits an unusual composition-dependence,
  which is different from the typical trend observed in other mixtures.
