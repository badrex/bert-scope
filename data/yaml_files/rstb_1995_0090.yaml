tldr: This article explores the relationship between genealogies and geography in
  population genetics. It discusses the close connection between the classical theory
  of identity by descent and genealogical structure, and develops a diffusion approximation
  to describe how lines of descent coalesce in spatially structured populations. The
  authors also highlight the importance of considering long-term population history
  when analyzing genealogies and suggest ways to infer this history from concordance
  between genealogies across loci.
