tldr: The authors conducted a critical experimental investigation of the "force" method
  to determine the dielectric capacity of conducting liquids at low frequencies, focusing
  on univalent electrolytes in aqueous solutions. They found that the method could
  provide precise results for various liquids, including solutions of proteins, which
  had been challenging to measure due to their surface orientation. The study aimed
  to establish accurate dielectric constant values and improve understanding of the
  dielectric properties of conducting solutions.
