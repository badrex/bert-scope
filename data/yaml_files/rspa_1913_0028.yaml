tldr: The author presents a new optical load-extension indicator that records load-extension
  diagrams without inertia effects. They demonstrate its use on gun-metal, brass,
  and phosphor-bronze, observing differences in their physical properties and molecular
  structures. The indicator also reveals the effects of annealing on brass and the
  absence of a true elastic modulus in the alloys tested.
