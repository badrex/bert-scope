tldr: This study examines the nutritive value of wheat meal and its effects on human
  health. Two participants lived on a diet of wheat meal and distilled water for varying
  periods, with their excreta and urine analyzed to determine the digestion and absorption
  of nutrients. The results showed that the wheat meal was deficient in nitrogen,
  fat, and salts, and that further research is needed to understand the role of sulfur
  in human nutrition.
