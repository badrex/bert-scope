tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of nitrogen iodide, focusing
  on the kinetics, activation energy, and the role of various factors such as pressure,
  ammonia, and water vapor. The results show that nitrogen iodide decomposes into
  nitrogen, ammonia, and iodine at low pressures, and the reaction rate is affected
  by the presence of ammonia and water vapor. The study also discusses the possibility
  of the reaction occurring throughout the lattice of the solid.
