tldr: The author, J. Frederic Daniell, describes a new voltaic arrangement called
  the Dissected Battery, which provides a constant current of electricity for any
  desired length of time. This innovation helps overcome the variability of action
  in common batteries, making it easier to measure and compare different voltaic phenomena.
  The author also discusses the importance of hydrogen's affinity for metal surfaces
  and its role in the decomposition of water by zinc in voltaic cells.
