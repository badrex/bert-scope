tldr: The author, Charles Blagden, explores various methods to recover the legibility
  of ancient writings and proposes a new method using chemical re-agents, such as
  alkalies and mineral acids, to restore faded texts on parchment. He also discusses
  the differences between ancient and modern inks and suggests that some ancient writings
  might have been printed rather than written by hand.
