tldr: The authors analyzed the spark spectrum of krypton to determine its electronic
  configurations and ionization potential. They found that the ionization potential
  of Kr+ is approximately 26.4 volts and identified various spectral lines in the
  krypton spark spectrum. The study provides a foundation for further research on
  krypton's atomic structure and properties.
