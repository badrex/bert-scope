tldr: The author shares a case study of a patient with smallpox who was treated with
  Cortex Peruvianus, also known as bark. The patient's condition improved significantly
  after taking the bark, and the author believes that the continued use of bark could
  have prevented a second fever. The bark helped invigorate and fortify the patient's
  spirits, supported their strength, and brought the pustules to a proper digestion.
