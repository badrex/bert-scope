tldr: The authors used a diffusive growth model to simulate the epitaxial growth of
  a single atom species on a low-index surface. They examined the growth interruption
  technique and the'recovery' effect, which involves the return of the specular beam
  to its pre-growth value after growth cessation. The authors found that the RHEED
  intensity recovery curves are insensitive to the diffraction condition and can be
  used to analyze surface-roughness recovery, enabling sensible quantitative studies
  of recovery.
