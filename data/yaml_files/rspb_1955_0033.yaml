tldr: The authors developed an improved gasometric method for simultaneously estimating
  oxygen content and percentage saturation in haemoglobin dissociation curve determinations.
  They used carbon monoxide as a reagent to release oxygen from blood solutions and
  combined techniques from the Van Slyke and Scholander gas analysis apparatuses.
  This method provided more accurate data for oxyhaemoglobin dissociation curves and
  allowed for the calculation of equilibrium constants for the reactions of haemoglobin
  with oxygen.
