tldr: This article introduces new variational principles to estimate the effective
  conductivity of composites with imperfect interfaces. The authors develop a systematic
  method called the interface comparison method to obtain new variational formulations
  for the effective conductivity. They apply these principles to obtain new upper
  and lower bounds on the effective conductivity for anisotropic particulate composites
  with interfacial barrier resistance. The results can be used to predict size effect
  phenomena and help in the optimal design of isotropic particulate suspensions.
