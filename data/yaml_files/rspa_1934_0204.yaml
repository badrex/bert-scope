tldr: This article investigates the chemical composition and properties of German
  brown coals and Irish peat. The authors examine the effects of heat on these materials
  and analyze the gases and substances produced during their carbonization. The study
  provides insights into the origin of the main "coking constituents" of bituminous
  coals and contributes to the understanding of coal chemistry and fuel research.
