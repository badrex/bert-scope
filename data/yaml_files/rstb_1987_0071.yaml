tldr: The article describes the in vitro replication of DNA containing either the
  SV40 or polyoma origin. The replication process requires the large-tumor antigen
  (T antigen) and extracts from cells that support replication in vivo. The host DNA
  polymerase α-primase complex plays a crucial role in discriminating between polyoma
  T antigen and SV40 T antigen-dependent replication of their homologous DNA. The
  study reconstitutes the replication process with purified components, including
  HeLa DNA polymerase α-primase complex, eukaryotic topoisomerase I, and a single-strand
  DNA binding protein.
