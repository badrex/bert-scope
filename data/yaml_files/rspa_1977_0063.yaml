tldr: The chemisorption of ethylene and halo-substituted alkenes on platinum surfaces
  was studied using X-ray and ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy. The authors
  found that initial dissociation of vinyl halides occurs at submonolayer coverage,
  followed by an associative regime at higher coverages. A mechanism involving oxidative
  addition of carbon-hydrogen bonds and dehydrohalogenation is proposed. The reactivity
  of ethylenic carbon-hydrogen bonds depends on adjacent halogen substitution, and
  an intermolecular mechanism is demonstrated for hydrogen halide elimination from
  mixed adlayer surfaces.
