tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted to understand the effects of different
  metals on gold and the wear of gold coins. The author investigates the chemical
  properties of gold alloys, the specific gravity of gold coins, and the wear caused
  by friction. The findings suggest that the loss of gold in coins is not due to defects
  in the composition of the gold but may be caused by the rough impression and milled
  edge used in coinage.
