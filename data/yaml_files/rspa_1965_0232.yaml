tldr: The authors determined the crystal and molecular structure of guanine hydrochloride
  dihydrate using X-ray single crystal analysis. They found that two guanine molecules
  are linked together by hydrogen bonds and form a centrosymmetrical dimer. The dimer
  is connected to four water molecules and two chlorine ions through hydrogen bonds.
  The study provides accurate values for bond lengths and angles in the guanine molecule,
  contributing to the understanding of nucleic acid components.
