tldr: This article introduces intrinsic wave functions in the nuclear shell model,
  which exhibit rotational properties and help describe collective motion in atomic
  nuclei. The author also discusses the expansion coefficients and their relation
  to angular momentum states, providing a deeper understanding of nuclear behavior.
