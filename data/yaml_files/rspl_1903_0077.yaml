tldr: This article investigates the correlation between physiological function and
  histological structure in the brain. The author examines different areas of the
  brain, including the motor, sensory, and visual areas, and discusses their unique
  structures and functions. The study provides insights into understanding how the
  brain processes and localizes various functions, such as movement, sensation, and
  vision.
