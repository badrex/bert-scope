tldr: This article investigates the regulation of adenylate cyclase in rat pancreatic
  plasma membranes. The authors found that hormone CCK-8 and cholera toxin affect
  the activation and deactivation rates of adenylate cyclase, which is regulated by
  guanine nucleotides. The study provides insights into the complex interaction between
  hormones and nucleotides in adenylate cyclase systems.
