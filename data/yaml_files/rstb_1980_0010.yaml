tldr: The article discusses the structure and synthesis of two classes of complementary
  RNAs (cRNAs) involved in the replication of influenza viruses. One class consists
  of viral mRNAs, while the other class is thought to be the template for genome replication.
  The syntheses of these two classes of cRNAs have different features and are regulated
  differently, indicating that they are synthesized by different mechanisms. The article
  also examines the primary structure of these cRNAs and their 5' and 3' terminal
  nucleotide sequences.
