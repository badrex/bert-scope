tldr: This article discusses the process of genetic transcription, focusing on the
  RNA-DNA complex and the role of RNA polymerase in synthesizing RNA from a DNA template.
  The author explores the molecular kinetics of RNA synthesis and the differences
  between in vitro and in vivo situations. The findings suggest that the in vitro
  model system lacks an essential component, a process that actively removes the nascent
  RNA transcript from the RNA polymerase complex.
