tldr: The MISO collaboration conducted low energy gamma-ray observations of the Seyfert
  galaxy NGC 4151, detecting a significant excess in the gamma-ray range above 260
  keV. The data suggest that the gamma-ray emission may be variable and could be related
  to the inverse-Compton process. The results are consistent with a two power-law
  spectrum with a break at 3 MeV, and the detected gamma-ray luminosity is estimated
  to be 5 x 10^44 erg s^-1. The findings support the presence of a compact object,
  possibly a black hole, in the nucleus of NGC 4151.
