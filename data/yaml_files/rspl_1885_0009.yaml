tldr: This article presents the results of the harmonic analysis of tidal observations,
  a method used to study the oscillation of sea levels. The author explains the process
  of analyzing tides into different components and provides tables of data for various
  ports. The analysis helps determine the height of water due to specific tides at
  any given time, past or future, and is essential for understanding the complex nature
  of tidal patterns.
