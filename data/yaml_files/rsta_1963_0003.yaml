tldr: This article presents a systematic treatment of crystallographic point groups
  using the concept of semi-direct products. It discusses well-known properties of
  point groups, such as the invariant subgroups and the theory of poles of finite
  rotations. The author demonstrates that all crystallographic point groups can be
  expressed as a semi-direct product of one of their invariant subgroups by a cyclic
  subgroup. This approach simplifies the use of symmetrizing and projection operators
  required to obtain symmetry-adapted functions.
