tldr: The author discusses the flow of water in rivers and open channels, challenging
  the laminar theory that assumes the water's velocity decreases from the surface
  to the bottom. The author presents experimental evidence and research findings that
  show the maximum water velocity is often found at a depth below the surface, not
  at the surface as previously believed.
