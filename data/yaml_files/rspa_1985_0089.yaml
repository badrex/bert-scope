tldr: The article investigates the high-frequency radiation of water waves by oscillating
  bodies, focusing on the heave and sway radiation problems. The authors derive three-term
  asymptotic expansions for the radiated wave amplitude using matched asymptotic expansions
  and reciprocity principles. The results are applied to a circular cylinder and a
  hemisphere, providing insights into the behavior of water waves in the presence
  of oscillating bodies.
