tldr: The article examines the modulation of water waves on arbitrary shear flows
  using the method of multiple scales. It derives a nonlinear Schrödinger equation
  with coefficients that depend on the shear, which agrees with previous work for
  the case of no shear and the long-wave limit of the Korteweg-de Vries equation.
  The results can be used to study the stability of Stokes waves over any shear.
