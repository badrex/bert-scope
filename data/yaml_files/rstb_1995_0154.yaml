tldr: This article investigates the interaction between normal and mutant SRY proteins
  and DNA in vertebrate sex determination. The authors found that SRY proteins bind
  to kinked DNA and can bend linear DNA, which may play a role in the formation of
  nucleoprotein complexes involved in testis differentiation. Mutations in the SRY
  protein can affect its ability to bind and bend DNA, potentially leading to sex-reversal
  in humans.
