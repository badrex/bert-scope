tldr: This article discusses the search for anisotropies in cosmic radiation, focusing
  on high, low, and intermediate energy ranges. The author examines the challenges
  of detecting anisotropies due to the interplanetary magnetic field and the solar
  wind, and explores the potential for discovering extragalactic cosmic rays. The
  article concludes that while there is no conclusive evidence for anisotropy at present,
  further research may reveal more information about the origin of cosmic rays.
