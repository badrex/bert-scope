tldr: This study investigates the impact of temperature on the carbon-dioxide assimilation
  and respiration in plants. The author highlights the importance of considering not
  only the current environmental conditions but also the plant's previous exposure
  to different temperatures and nutritional states. The research emphasizes the complexity
  of plant functions and the need for uniform conditions in experiments to obtain
  accurate results.
