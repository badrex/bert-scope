tldr: This article presents further observations on a sleeping sickness case, focusing
  on the patient's condition and the precise enumerative methods used to study the
  disease. The authors found a regular cycle of trypanosome numbers in the patient's
  blood, which corresponded to changes in temperature, pulse rate, and leukocyte counts.
  The patient's condition gradually worsened, with neurological and physical symptoms,
  eventually leading to his death. The study provides insights into the disease's
  pathophysiology and potential treatment approaches.
