tldr: This article extends a deductive theory of turbulence to hydromagnetics, deriving
  a pair of differential equations for the scalars defining the correlation in velocities
  and magnetic field intensities at two different points and times. The author introduces
  correlations between the components of velocity and magnetic field, and assumes
  that these correlations depend only on the difference in time and the distance between
  the points. The resulting equations provide a basis for an elementary theory of
  hydromagnetic turbulence.
