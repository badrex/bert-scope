tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the effect of various metals
  and metalloids on the electrical conductivity of copper. They found that the presence
  of impurities, such as phosphorus, arsenic, and lead, significantly reduces the
  conductivity of copper. The authors also discovered that annealing copper wires
  can improve their conductivity. This research helps in understanding the properties
  of copper and its alloys for various applications.
