tldr: Samuel B. Howlett invented a compensating barometer that requires no corrections
  for zero or temperature. The barometer consists of two tubes filled with mercury,
  and the elevation of the mercury in the barometric tube is estimated by the difference
  between its level and that of the mercury in the closed tube. This design allows
  for accurate readings without the need for additional calculations, making it a
  useful tool for meteorological purposes.
