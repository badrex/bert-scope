tldr: This article discusses the formation and evolution of protostars, focusing on
  the role of infrared radiation in the process. The author explains how interstellar
  gas clouds collapse and form clusters of protostars, which can be detected as high-luminosity
  infrared objects. The article also explores the dynamics of these collapsing clouds,
  the resulting fragments, and the formation of disks around protostars.
