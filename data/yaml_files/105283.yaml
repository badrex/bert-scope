tldr: The author, William Brakenridge, responds to a previous account on the numbers
  and increase of people in England by Mr. Forster. He discusses the methods used
  to estimate the population, focusing on the number of houses and their distribution
  across different areas. Brakenridge argues that the previous calculations were based
  on inaccurate assumptions and provides his own estimates, which are lower than the
  original numbers.
