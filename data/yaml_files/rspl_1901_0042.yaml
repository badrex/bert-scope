tldr: The author presents a theoretical analysis of elastic solids in motion within
  a liquid, considering factors such as hydrostatic pressure, viscosity, and the effects
  of cavities within the solid. The study provides a deeper understanding of how solids
  interact with liquids and the forces at play during motion.
