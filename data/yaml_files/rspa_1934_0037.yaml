tldr: The authors developed a photoelectric spectrophotometer that uses dual electrostatic
  compensation to measure the extinction coefficients of substances in solution, particularly
  in the ultraviolet region. The device eliminates errors due to fluctuations in the
  light source and does not require mechanical devices for varying light intensity.
  The method is based on measuring the ratio of the photoelectric currents from two
  cells and is suitable for various scientific applications.
