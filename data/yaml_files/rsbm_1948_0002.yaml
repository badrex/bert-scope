tldr: The article is an obituary for Francis William Aston, a prominent physicist
  who contributed significantly to the fields of high-vacuum research and atomic physics.
  Aston worked with J.J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory, where he made important
  discoveries in positive rays and helped develop the parabola method for identifying
  different atoms and atomic groupings. He also conducted research on the dark space,
  rare gases, and the potential distribution in that region. Aston's work laid the
  foundation for the development of mass spectrometry and his discoveries had a significant
  impact on the field of atomic physics.
