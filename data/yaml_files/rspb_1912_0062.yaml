tldr: This study investigates the cholesterol content in various tissues of rabbits
  under different diets and during inanition. The results support the hypothesis that
  cholesterol from broken-down cells is utilized in the formation of new cells, and
  the liver plays a role in breaking down dead cells and eliminating their cholesterol
  in bile. The findings also show that the cholesterol content varies in different
  tissues and is affected by diet and nutritional state.
