tldr: The article discusses the structure and function of the glycocalyx, a carbohydrate-rich
  layer on the surface of cells. It examines the diverse forms of surface coats on
  various cell types, including rickettsiae, bacteria, amoebae, sea-urchin eggs, and
  cat intestinal microvilli. The author presents new observations on the form of the
  glycocalyx and its role in cell recognition, adhesiveness, adsorption, protection,
  and cell movement. The article also highlights the importance of electron microscopy
  and other techniques in studying the glycocalyx and its function.
