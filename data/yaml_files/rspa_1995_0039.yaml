tldr: This study investigates the effects of stress wave propagation in split Hopkinson
  pressure bar tests, which are used to measure material properties at high strain
  rates. The authors present analytical and numerical simulations that show plastic
  wave fronts within the specimen can cause discrepancies in flow stress measurements
  and an apparent increase in strain rate sensitivity. The results suggest that the
  assumption of uniform stress and strain distribution within a split Hopkinson pressure
  bar specimen is incorrect at high impact velocities.
