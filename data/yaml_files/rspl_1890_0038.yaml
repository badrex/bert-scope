tldr: The authors conducted a detailed microscopic investigation of the cingulum,
  corpus callosum, and fornix in the Marmoset monkey using serial sections and staining
  methods. They described the structure and function of these fiber tracts and provided
  insights into their connections and roles in the brain. The study contributes to
  the understanding of brain anatomy and function, particularly in relation to sensation
  and motor control.
