tldr: The authors investigate the formation of Neumann bands in meteorites and provide
  evidence that these bands are twins. They use etching techniques to examine the
  geometrical relationships between the bands and the matrix, and find that the bands
  lie in {112} planes. The twin relationship between the band and the matrix is confirmed
  through the mirror image of etch pits.
