tldr: The authors explain the crystal structure of rare gas solids, focusing on helium,
  neon, argon, krypton, and xenon. They propose a new approach that combines long-range
  and short-range interactions, specifically the van der Waals energy and the crystal
  field, to determine the correct crystal structure. The f.c.c. structure is favored
  due to its centrosymmetric nature, which results in a wider energy split and greater
  van der Waals attractive energy.
