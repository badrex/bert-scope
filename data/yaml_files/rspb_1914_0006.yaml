tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the cholesterol content in growing
  chickens under different diets. They found that the cholesterol content in chickens
  remained relatively constant regardless of the diet, suggesting that cholesterol
  is a conserved substance in the animal organism. The study also showed that chickens
  could thrive on a diet devoid of cholesterol and phytosterol.
