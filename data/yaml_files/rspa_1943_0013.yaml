tldr: The authors study the reflexion of X-rays from the anti-phase nuclei of the
  AuCu<sub>3</sub> alloy. They analyze five different models of how the anti-phase
  nuclei change step and find that the closest agreement with the observed broadening
  is given by a model in which gold atoms avoid each other. This research helps to
  understand the structure and properties of the alloy.
