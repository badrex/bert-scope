tldr: In this article, Michael Faraday describes his experiments on magneto-electric
  induction and the evolution of electricity using the earth's magnetic field. He
  explains how the interaction between a helix and a soft iron cylinder can produce
  electrical currents and how this can be applied to indicate disturbances in magnetic
  forces. Faraday also discusses his attempts to create electricity using the earth's
  magnetic field alone, without the use of any other magnets, and his successful experiments
  with a revolving copper plate.
