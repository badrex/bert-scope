tldr: The authors develop a molecular-field theory for anisotropic ferromagnetism,
  expanding on Anderson's treatment of antiferromagnetism. They apply the theory to
  face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, simple cubic, body-centered tetragonal
  magnetic lattices, and rutile structure antiferromagnetics. The theory predicts
  possible preferred directions for spin alignment in antiferromagnetics but cannot
  yet predict the most stable spin arrangements without more information on exchange
  parameters.
