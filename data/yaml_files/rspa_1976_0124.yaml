tldr: The authors conducted ab initio calculations using molecular orbital theory
  to study the electronic structures of 2-methylpropene and its radical-cation. They
  found that the energy difference between the 2BX planar and 2B2 perpendicular states
  of the radical-cation is about 67 kJ mol-1. The study also showed that the participation
  of the 2B2 state in a proposed 1,3-hydrogen shift lifts the orbital symmetry restriction
  predicted for this process in the case of the 2BX state. This research provides
  a better understanding of complex reaction systems in mass spectrometry.
