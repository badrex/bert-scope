tldr: The author examines the structure and function of the hearing organ in crustaceans.
  They describe the inner surface of the sac, the distribution of nerves, and the
  role of siliccous sand particles in regulating the size of grains. The study also
  discusses variations in the organs of hearing in different crustaceans and mentions
  another organ at the base of large antennae, which may be related to smell. The
  paper includes illustrative drawings.
