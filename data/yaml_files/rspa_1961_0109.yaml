tldr: This lecture by Sir Lawrence Bragg reviews the development of X-ray analysis
  from its beginnings in 1912 to the mid-20th century. He discusses the key advances
  and contributions that shaped the field, including the use of Fourier series, the
  phase problem, and the development of X-ray diffraction machines. Bragg highlights
  the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and the role of chance in scientific
  discovery.
