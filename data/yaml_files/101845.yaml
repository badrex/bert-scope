tldr: In 1686, astronomers observed two eclipses of Jupiter by the Moon, providing
  valuable data for determining the longitude of places and improving geographical
  knowledge. The observations were made in London and Totteridge, with the help of
  accurate time measurements and the use of ephemerides. These types of observations
  were essential for understanding celestial mechanics and their applications in geography.
