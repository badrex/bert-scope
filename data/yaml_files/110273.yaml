tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the phenomena of endosmose and exosmose
  using a glass tube with a bladder membrane. They found that the animal membrane's
  strong attraction for water allowed water to pass through it, while alcohol and
  other water-soluble substances caused the phenomena of endosmose. This research
  provided insights into the properties of animal membranes and their role in osmosis.
