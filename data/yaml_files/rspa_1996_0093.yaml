tldr: This article investigates the acoustic radiation from plates into a wedge-shaped
  fluid region, focusing on the flow of acoustic energy between adjacent subsystems.
  The author derives an expression for the radiation resistance per unit span for
  a general velocity distribution on the plate and provides detailed analysis for
  the simplest case. The results can be applied to estimate the flow of acoustic energy
  into the fluid for complex interacting structures, such as aircraft in air.
