tldr: The authors studied the low-temperature thermal decomposition of ammonium perchlorate
  and found that it only decomposes to about 20-30% at these temperatures, leaving
  a residue chemically identical to the original salt. They analyzed the kinetics
  of the decomposition of whole crystals, powder, and compressed pellets, observing
  a variation in activation energy for nucleus growth. The researchers concluded that
  the low-temperature reaction represents the decomposition of strained material in
  the intermosaic grain boundaries, while the high-temperature reaction decomposes
  unstrained material forming the core of the mosaic blocks.
