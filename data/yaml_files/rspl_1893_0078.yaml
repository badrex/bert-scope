tldr: The author investigates the size variations in different parts of the shore
  crab (Carcinus mænas) in two samples from the Bay of Naples and Plymouth Sound.
  They find that the observed deviations from the average size of each organ are grouped
  symmetrically around the average and occur with a frequency corresponding to the
  probability integral. The study also explores the correlation between pairs of organs
  and suggests that the female Carcinus mænas is slightly dimorphic in Naples with
  respect to its frontal breadth.
