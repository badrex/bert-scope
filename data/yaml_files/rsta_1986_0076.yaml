tldr: This article discusses recent trends in surface science, focusing on the use
  of electron spectroscopy to study the properties and reactivity of surfaces. It
  highlights advances in techniques such as low-energy electron diffraction, electron
  energy loss spectroscopy, and extended X-ray absorption fine structure. The article
  also explores the potential of laser-induced plasmas as high-brightness X-ray sources
  for studying surface transitions and adsorbed layers.
