tldr: This study investigates the effects of long-term breeding of mice in cold environments.
  The results show that mice of different strains experience changes in fertility
  and nestling mortality over generations. Hybrid mice show improvements in nestling
  survival rates and weight gain in cold environments, while inbred mice maintain
  consistent breeding performance in warmer conditions. The findings suggest that
  these changes may be due to cumulative maternal effects or a decline in the action
  of pathogenic organisms.
