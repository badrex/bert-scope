tldr: This study investigates how eye movements and the spatiotemporal pathways in
  the early visual system efficiently code time-varying images. The authors analyze
  the spatiotemporal spectrum of natural images and the effects of tracking on the
  velocity field and stationary components. They find that tracking reduces the temporal
  frequency bandwidth of the velocity field component at the point of tracking, while
  the stationary component's spectrum remains unaffected. The results suggest that
  the visual system's coding strategy optimizes the transmission of visual information,
  given physiological constraints like limited dynamic range and spatial and temporal
  bandwidths.
