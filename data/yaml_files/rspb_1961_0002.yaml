tldr: The study investigates the development of chloramphenicol resistance in bacteria,
  specifically \lt;italic\gt;Bact. lactis aerogenes\lt;/italic\gt;. The research explores
  the adaptive and lethal processes in liquid media and on agar plates, suggesting
  that the resistance is not due to pre-existing mutants but rather the result of
  a competition between adaptive and lethal processes. The findings support the adaptive
  hypothesis for the development of drug resistance with this agent and organism.
