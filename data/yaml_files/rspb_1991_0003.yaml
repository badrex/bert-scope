tldr: The author's study of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) loci reveals
  an overdispersed molecular clock, meaning that some non-synonymous sites have undergone
  many substitutions while others have had few or none. This discovery challenges
  previous assumptions about the evolution of MHC molecules and provides insights
  into the role of balancing selection in their evolution. The findings also suggest
  that the persistence of MHC polymorphic alleles is longer than previously thought,
  with some alleles persisting for over 20 million years.
