tldr: This article presents a general theory for the description of microwave spectra
  of nonlinear open-shell molecules in the presence of external electric or magnetic
  fields. The authors describe the detection and analysis of the HCO radical's microwave
  spectrum, providing insights into the molecular parameters and comparing them with
  solid-state studies. The study has implications for understanding the physics of
  molecules and molecular astronomy.
