tldr: This article describes a comparison of platinum and gas thermometers and a determination
  of the boiling point of sulphur on the nitrogen scale. The research was conducted
  in the laboratory of the Bureau International des Poids et Mesures at Sèvres. The
  authors found that the differences between the observed values on the nitrogen scale
  and those deduced from the platinum thermometer were small, even at high temperatures.
  The boiling point of sulphur on the nitrogen scale was determined to be 445.27 degrees.
