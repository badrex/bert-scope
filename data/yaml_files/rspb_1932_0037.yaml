tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the biochemical lesion in avian
  polyneuritis. They found that vitamin Bx deficiency affects the intermediary metabolism
  of carbohydrates, specifically glucose and lactate, in birds' brains. This discovery
  sheds light on the role of vitamin Bx in maintaining proper carbohydrate metabolism
  and preventing avian polyneuritis.
