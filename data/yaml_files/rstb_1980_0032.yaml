tldr: This study investigates a series of Late Pleistocene deposits at Wing, Rutland,
  in the East Midlands of England. The sequence of till, lake clays, compressed wood,
  and moss peats and peaty silts is found in a small, closed basin cut deeply into
  the Jurassic bedrock. Pollen and plant macrofossil analyses provide a long and continuous
  record of vegetational and environmental history at the site, dating the deposits
  to the Last (Ipswichian) Interglacial and early Devensian Glacial stages. The study
  adds to the understanding of vegetational and environmental history during the Late
  Pleistocene and helps in reconstructing local changes in vegetation and environment.
