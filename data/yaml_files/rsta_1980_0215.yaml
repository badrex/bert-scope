tldr: This study examines the chemical variations in upper mantle nodules from southern
  African kimberlites, providing evidence for the chemical heterogeneity in the Earth's
  mantle. The research focuses on the processes that produce and modify these nodules,
  including infiltration metasomatism and partial melting. The findings challenge
  the idea of a homogeneous upper mantle and suggest that further research should
  consider local and regional variations in the Earth's mantle.
