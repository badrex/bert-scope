tldr: This article discusses the principles and applications of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance
  (NMR) imaging for characterizing fluids in porous solids, such as hydrocarbon reservoir
  rocks. The authors outline the behavior of fluids in these systems and explore the
  potential of NMR imaging to reveal internal structures and properties of porous
  solids. They present experimental results for imaging in model porous solids and
  natural rocks, demonstrating the capability of NMR to indirectly image the solid
  structures through the signal of fluids permeating the pore space. The article also
  addresses the spatial heterogeneity of these materials and proposes strategies for
  characterizing their properties.
