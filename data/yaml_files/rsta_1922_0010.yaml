tldr: The authors investigate the secondary spectrum of hydrogen and its intensity,
  examining the effects of impurities in discharge tubes and the influence of electrical
  excitation and pressure. They also discuss the classification of lines in the spectrum
  and the ongoing debate on whether the secondary spectrum is due to the hydrogen
  atom or molecule.
