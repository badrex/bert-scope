tldr: This article discusses gene action and its control in development, focusing
  on the assembly of genic products into organized structures in the ciliated protozoan
  Paramecium aurelia. The author examines processes such as homonucleation, heteronucleation,
  and allosteric transitions, which are essential for the development of cilia, their
  basal bodies, and associated structures. The findings suggest that existing structures
  play a crucial role in determining development, and genes control the synthesis
  of molecular building blocks but not their assembly or positioning.
