tldr: The authors conducted a study on the viscoelastic properties of low-molecular-mass
  polystyrene melts. They found that the equilibrium compliance of these materials
  is proportional to their molecular mass, and the steady-flow viscosity follows a
  modified free volume equation. The results provide insights into the behavior of
  polymers and their applications in various industries.
