tldr: The authors investigated the pyrolysis of benzoyl bromide in the presence of
  toluene, finding that the rate-determining step is the unimolecular dissociation
  of the molecule. They estimated the activation energy and calculated the heat of
  formation of benzoyl radicals, leading to the determination of various bond dissociation
  energies.
