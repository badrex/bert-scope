tldr: This article discusses the spectral analysis of a signal from a randomly sampled
  time series using the direct transform method. The authors compare this method with
  the correlation method and find that while the computational effort is generally
  less with the direct transform, a greater quantity of data is needed to achieve
  a given level of variability. The article also explores the relation between variability
  and sampling rate to find an optimum rate for a given amount of computation.
