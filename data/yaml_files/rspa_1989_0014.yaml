tldr: The authors present a new approach to solving boundary-value problems involving
  cracks in materials, using hypersingular boundary integral equations. This method
  reduces the problem to a single integral equation, which can be solved using computational
  schemes. The authors also discuss extensions to three-dimensional problems and the
  advantages of using hypersingular integral equations over other methods.
