tldr: This article investigates the spectrum of metallic manganese, its alloys, and
  compounds at high temperatures using flame spectroscopy. The author compares the
  spectra of various manganese samples, including metallic manganese, manganic oxide,
  and manganese-containing alloys. They also discuss the challenges in measuring the
  bands and lines in these spectra, as well as the differences between eye observations
  and photographic recordings.
