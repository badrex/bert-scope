tldr: The author discusses the formation and evolution of planetary satellites and
  rings through the accumulation of material around planets and the role of collisions
  and tidal forces. They explain how the long-term mean angular momentum of particles
  in orbit around a planet leads to the formation of equatorial discs, and how the
  sense of the planet's spin becomes important in the later stages of orbital evolution.
  The author also describes the process of a small satellite being destroyed by tidal
  stress and the formation of the Roche Zone.
