tldr: The study investigates the role of the prefrontal cortex and anterior cingulate
  cortex in attention and dual task performance. It shows that these areas are engaged
  during new learning and problem-solving but not when tasks become automatic. The
  research also demonstrates that there is more interference when subjects generate
  verbs than when they repeat nouns during dual task performance.
