tldr: This study examines the thermoluminescence of Luna 24 core material to understand
  the solar-flare exposure and radiation history of the lunar regolith. The researchers
  found that track-density gradients in mineral grains from different depths indicate
  that most of the material has been cycled through the top millimeter of the surface
  at some point in history. The data suggest two possible models for the regolith's
  deposition and irradiation history, with implications for future lunar missions
  and sample storage.
