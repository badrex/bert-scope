revised_title: 'Soil Permeability and Irrigation: Understanding Sodicity and Salinity'
scientific_discipline: Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science

- Soil structure
tldr: This article discusses the impact of sodicity and salinity on soil permeability
  and how controlling electrolyte levels in irrigation water can help maintain soil
  structure. It explains the mechanisms behind the decrease in permeability in sodic
  soils and the importance of understanding clay-particle interactions in relation
  to irrigation practices.
