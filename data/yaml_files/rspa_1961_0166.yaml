tldr: This article presents a density matrix formalism to explain various coherence
  effects observed in double resonance experiments. It demonstrates how the intensity
  of resonance light can be modulated at specific frequencies due to radio-frequency
  fields inducing transitions between Zeeman sublevels. The author applies this method
  to the case of the even isotopes of mercury, showing how it can be used to predict
  resonance positions and shapes, and calculate re-emitted light intensities.
