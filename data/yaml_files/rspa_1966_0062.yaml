tldr: This article discusses recent advancements in the technique of seismic recording
  and analysis, focusing on the collection and processing of seismic station readings.
  The International Seismological Research Centre in Edinburgh uses a standardized
  format for submitting data, which is then fed into a computer for error checking
  and epicenter determination. The article also explores the use of reference points
  and travel times to locate the source of seismic events and improve the efficiency
  of earthquake detection.
