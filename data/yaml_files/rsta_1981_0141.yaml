tldr: The authors report on the search for high-energy gamma rays from pulsars using
  the night air Cherenkov technique at the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research.
  They found that the flux of pulsed gamma rays from the Crab and Vela pulsars is
  much lower than expected at energies above 300 GeV, and discuss the implications
  of their findings for the understanding of pulsar emissions.
