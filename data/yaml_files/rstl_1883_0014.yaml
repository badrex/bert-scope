tldr: The author discovers a new type of Orbitolites, which provides a complete transition
  between the Milioline and Orbitoline plans of growth in foraminifera. This new type
  of Orbitolites supports the author's classification principles and challenges previous
  classifications by M. D'Orbigny. The research sheds light on the evolution and descent
  of foraminifera, showing the relationship between Orbitolites and Orbiculina.
