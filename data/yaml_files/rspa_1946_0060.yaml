tldr: This paper discusses axisymmetric turbulence, a type of turbulence that is simpler
  and more common in practice than isotropic turbulence. The author uses invariant
  theory to analyze the properties of axisymmetric turbulence, focusing on the fundamental
  velocity correlation and the rates of change of mean squares of vorticity components.
  The study provides insights into the behavior of turbulence in fluid dynamics and
  its relation to isotropic turbulence.
