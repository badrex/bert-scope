tldr: Researchers conducted experiments to improve the measurement of the ohm, using
  modified methods from Kirchhoff and Rowland. They used two coils of copper wire
  and a ballistic galvanometer to determine the coefficient of mutual induction and
  resistance. The experiments were conducted at the Cavendish Laboratory, and the
  results provided a more accurate value for the ohm.
