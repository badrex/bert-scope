tldr: This article discusses the ecological roles and importance of cephalopods in
  the world's oceans. It highlights their unique biology, diverse lifestyles, and
  resilience to environmental fluctuations. Cephalopods play a crucial role in the
  marine food chain, consuming a wide variety of prey and serving as a significant
  food source for other species. The article also explores the potential for future
  exploitation of cephalopod species as fish stocks decline and the impact of their
  presence on the distribution of chemicals and energy in the ocean.
