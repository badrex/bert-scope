tldr: This article investigates the thermal decomposition of barium azide crystals.
  The authors find that the rate of development of pressure is determined by the rate
  of increase in numbers of nuclei and the rate at which these nuclei grow. They also
  discover that the numbers of nuclei increase as the third power of time, and the
  pressure of nitrogen increases with the sixth to eighth power of time.
