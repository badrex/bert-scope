tldr: This article explores the scattering of scalar waves by semi-infinite rods of
  circular cross-section, focusing on the boundary conditions and their effects on
  the scattered field. The author examines the distant field, average pressure amplitude,
  and scattering coefficient for different angles of incidence and boundary conditions,
  providing valuable insights into the behavior of waves interacting with cylindrical
  obstacles.
