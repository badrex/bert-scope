tldr: This article discusses the concept of colour symmetry and its implications on
  new particles and quantum numbers in the context of the strong interaction. The
  authors propose a theory where the extension of the strong group leads to the existence
  of new particles and the mixing of conventional and coloured particles. They also
  present predictions that can be tested to validate their theory.
