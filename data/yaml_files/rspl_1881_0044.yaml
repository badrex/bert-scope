tldr: The author investigates the absorption of gases by solids and the fixation of
  gases in metals under high pressure and temperature. They find that glass, silicates,
  borates, and phosphates absorb gases, especially carbon dioxide, while metals absorb
  hydrogen and its compounds with carbon. This research challenges the traditional
  understanding of the three states of matter and suggests a continuity between the
  liquid and gaseous states.
