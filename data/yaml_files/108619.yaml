tldr: This article explores the mathematical principles and properties of caustics,
  focusing on the relationship between reflection and refraction. It discusses the
  concept of secondary caustics and their connection to the primary caustic, as well
  as the impact of different incident ray configurations on the formation of caustics.
  The author also provides insights into the theory of combined reflexions and refractions
  of a pencil of rays transmitted through a plate or prism.
