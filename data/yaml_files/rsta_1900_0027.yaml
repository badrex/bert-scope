tldr: This article discusses the underground temperature measurements taken at Oxford
  in 1899 using five platinum-resistance thermometers. The author describes the setup
  and methodology of the experiment, as well as the challenges faced, such as discrepancies
  in the readings. The findings contribute to the understanding of underground temperature
  variations and the potential for geothermal energy exploration.
