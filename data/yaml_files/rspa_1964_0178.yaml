tldr: The authors conducted experiments on the viscoelastic properties of polystyrene
  solutions and found that the Zimm theory accurately defines the behavior of solutions
  with molecular weights below 3,000. However, for higher molecular weight solutions
  and more concentrated solutions in poor solvents, the Zimm theory does not agree
  with the experimental results. The Rouse theory provides a better explanation for
  the viscoelastic behavior of these solutions.
