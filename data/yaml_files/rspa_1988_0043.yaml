tldr: This article presents a study on the kinetics of polymer crystallization, focusing
  on the growth of lamellar crystals by chain folding of polymer molecules. The authors
  describe the process using Markov rate processes and discuss the equilibrium distributions
  for hexagonal and square crystal structures. They also examine the continuum limit
  of these models and compare them to existing growth models.
