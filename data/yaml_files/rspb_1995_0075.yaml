tldr: The author questions the idea of cortically created illusions of visual motion
  and suggests that these illusions could be induced by retinal movement signals from
  repeated lines due to accommodation fluctuation of the eye's lens. The author provides
  evidence from various experiments and discusses the implications of this hypothesis
  on the study of visual perception and the use of gratings as stimuli for vision
  research.
