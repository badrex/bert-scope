tldr: The authors discuss the interpretation of the relativity wave equation for two
  electrons in quantum dynamics. They explain that the wave function must satisfy
  certain conditions to make sense, such as ensuring no collision is taking place
  and the second electron is far enough away to not be disturbed by the first electron's
  detection. This is important for understanding and interpreting the wave equation
  accurately.
