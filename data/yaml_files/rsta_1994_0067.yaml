tldr: This article surveys multi-factor term structure models in finance, focusing
  on models with a finite-dimensional state-space representation. It discusses the
  use of continuous-time stochastic calculus in constructing and applying these models,
  particularly for managing interest-rate risk and understanding the process by which
  interest rates change over time. The article also explores single-factor and infinite-factor
  models, as well as the calibration and empirical comparisons of these models.
