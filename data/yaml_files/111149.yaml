tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted by John Phillips on the deviation
  of a pendulum's plane from the meridional and other vertical planes. The author
  explores the effects of various conditions, such as the weight and shape of the
  pendulum, suspension materials, and the influence of air currents and elliptical
  motion on the pendulum's deviation. The findings could potentially contribute to
  the improvement of timekeeping devices and understanding of gravity.
