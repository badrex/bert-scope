tldr: This article explores the entropy of mixing in athermal binary solutions with
  molecules of different shapes and sizes. The authors use a lattice model to derive
  approximate formulae for the entropy of mixing and find that it depends on the shapes
  of the molecules rather than their relative sizes. The study extends previous work
  to molecules shaped like equilateral triangles, regular tetrahedra, and squares,
  providing a better understanding of how molecular shapes affect the entropy of mixing
  in athermal solutions.
