tldr: This article presents observations on the variation and dip of the magnetic
  needle made at the Royal Society between 1786 and 1805. The author, George Gilpin,
  provides a detailed account of the instruments used and the method he employed to
  analyze the data. The results show the variation in the compass direction and the
  dip of the magnetic needle over time, with a summary of the findings for each month.
  Comparing Gilpin's observations with those of Henry Cavendish from 1775, the mean
  annual decrease in the dip is calculated to be 4f1.3, and the progressive annual
  decrease is 1'4 on average.
