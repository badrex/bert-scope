tldr: The author investigates the crystal structure of di-w-propylmonocyanogold and
  suggests a constitution for its decomposition products, di-w-propyldicyanodigold
  and aurous cyanide. The insoluble di-w-propyldicyanodigold has a zig-zag chain structure,
  while aurous cyanide has a straight chain structure. The study contributes to understanding
  the properties and structures of gold cyano derivatives.
