tldr: This article presents an experimental study of alternating current dynamo-electric
  machines, focusing on the current induced in the coils and magnets by the varying
  currents and positions of the armature. The author demonstrates that these induced
  currents affect the machine's performance, leading to a reduction in the average
  magnetism of the magnets. The study provides insights into the behavior of alternating
  current machines and contributes to the understanding of armature reaction and electromotive
  force.
