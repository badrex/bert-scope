tldr: The author investigates the rise in refractive index of linseed oil in solid
  films over time. They study the effect of aging on the oil's refractive index and
  its implications for the conservation of paintings. The author also examines the
  refractive index of oil films in paintings from different time periods, providing
  insights into the materials used by early painters and the techniques they employed.
