tldr: The study investigates the effects of denervation on fish red muscle fibers,
  discovering that after 40-50 hours of denervation, miniature endplate potentials
  disappear, and action potentials can be induced in the muscles after approximately
  3 weeks. The action potential is sodium-dependent and sensitive to tetrodotoxin,
  indicating that RNA synthesis is necessary for the induction of the action potential
  mechanism, which is under neural control.
