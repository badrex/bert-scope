tldr: This article explores the propagation of electromagnetic plane waves in anisotropic
  media using bivectors. Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous plane waves are considered,
  with a focus on the effects of electrical and magnetic anisotropy on wave behavior.
  The study provides a geometrical interpretation of wave properties using bivectors
  and their associated directional ellipses.
