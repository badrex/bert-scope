tldr: The article presents general formulae for generating unsteady potential flows
  with the presence of finite two-dimensional cavities. It investigates two distinct
  cases, where the fluid at infinity is either in accelerative motion or at rest,
  and provides a class of solutions for each case. The study also includes steady
  flows in a gravitational field and explores solutions representing such flows past
  a finite cavity.
