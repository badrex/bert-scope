tldr: The authors discovered a previously unknown ganglion in the human temporal bone,
  which they named the Stapedial Ganglion. This ganglion is associated with a plexus
  of nerves derived from the facial and pneumogastric nerves. The researchers found
  that the ganglion is embedded in bone and has an irregular shape. The physiological
  significance of this ganglion remains to be determined through further experimentation
  and observation.
