tldr: The author presents a new extensometer design for measuring small strains in
  materials and structures. The instrument is self-contained, supports the tested
  rod, and touches it only at the points where the clips are attached. The extensometer
  measures the mean strain by observing the displacement of two points on the rod's
  axis. This design allows for accurate measurements of small strains, which is essential
  for determining Young's modulus and observing the behavior of materials as they
  approach their limit of elasticity.
