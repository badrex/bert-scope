tldr: The study investigates the preleptotene chromosome condensation stage in Lilium
  hybrid cv. Black Beauty, estimating its duration to be about 1.16 days in pollen
  mother cells and 0.7 days in embryo sac mother cells. The research concludes that
  this stage has no significant function and may represent a mitotic reversion in
  the process of meiosis.
