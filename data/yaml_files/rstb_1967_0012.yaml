tldr: The study examines the bacterial and yeast flora of five lakes on Deception
  Island in Antarctica, focusing on their temperature characteristics and nutritional
  requirements. The research shows that the isolated bacteria are well adapted to
  the temperature regimes and nutritional environments of the Antarctic lakes, with
  many having optimum growth temperatures below 20Â°C. The findings contribute to understanding
  the microbial life in the Antarctic ecosystem.
