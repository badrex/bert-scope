tldr: The author examines the modifications of the first and second visceral arches
  in various elasmobranch fish species, focusing on the homologies of the auditory
  ossicles. They analyze the ligaments and articulations connecting the bones and
  discuss the differences in anatomical features among species. This study contributes
  to the understanding of the evolution and development of elasmobranch fish anatomy.
