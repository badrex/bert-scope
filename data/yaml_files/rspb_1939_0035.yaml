tldr: This article explores the impact of temperature on insect activity and distribution.
  It demonstrates that the lowest temperature at which insects can exhibit activity
  is crucial for their survival and distribution. The author also investigates the
  concept of acclimatization, where previous exposure to different temperatures affects
  the chill-coma temperature but has little impact on the insects' normal activity
  zone.
