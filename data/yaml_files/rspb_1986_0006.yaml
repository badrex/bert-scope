tldr: The study compares the number of plasmalemmal vesicles in arterial and venous
  endothelial cells of rats. It finds that arterial endothelial cells contain about
  twice as many vesicles as venous cells, suggesting that differences in vesicle numbers
  do not contribute significantly to the selective accumulation of atherogenic plasma
  proteins in arteries. The research also indicates that localized accumulations of
  atherogenic plasma proteins may result from small, continuous excesses of influx
  over elimination.
