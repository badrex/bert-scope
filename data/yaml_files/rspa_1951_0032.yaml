tldr: The authors describe a dielectric constant method for following the non-stationary
  state in polymerization, focusing on the operation and performance of the instrument.
  They discuss the stability, sensitivity, and thermal effects of the instrument,
  and demonstrate its usefulness in monitoring changes in dielectric constant and
  measuring small changes in gas pressure. This method can be applied to study photochemically
  induced polymerization and the effects of heat on liquids.
