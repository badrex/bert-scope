tldr: The authors investigate the magnetic anisotropy of crystalline nitrates and
  carbonates, focusing on the role of nitrate and carbonate ions in the magnetic properties
  of these crystals. They find that the magnetic anisotropy of these crystals is largely
  due to the anisotropy of the individual ions, and suggest that the electronic structure
  of these ions plays a significant role in their magnetic properties.
