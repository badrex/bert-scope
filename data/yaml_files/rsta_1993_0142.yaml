tldr: The author investigates the global dynamical behavior of suspensions of small,
  orientable, non-interacting particles in recirculating flows. The patterns formed
  are a consequence of dynamical attractors that characterize the evolution of particle
  orientations with time. These patterns are spatially varying orientations or planes
  of orientations to which all particles are eventually attracted, leading to a preferred
  microscopic arrangement of the suspended phase.
