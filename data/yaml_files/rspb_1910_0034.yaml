tldr: This study investigates the effect of bacterial endotoxins on phagocytosis,
  using in vitro experiments. The researchers found that endotoxins can reduce phagocytic
  activity and that this action is specific to certain bacteria. The study also shows
  that endotoxins are resistant to heat and can act as a "stimulin" in some cases.
  The findings contribute to a better understanding of the immune system and the role
  of bacterial endotoxins in infections.
