tldr: The authors analyzed the surface lipid composition of Brassica oleracea (cabbage)
  leaves and found that nonacosane and its derivatives make up over 60% of its weight.
  They used gas-liquid chromatography, adsorption, and reversed-phase partition film
  chromatography to determine the composition of the hydrocarbon fraction and the
  nonacosane derivatives. This study provides insight into the importance of nonacosane
  and its derivatives in plant lipids.
