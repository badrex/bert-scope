tldr: Edmund Halley discusses Mr. Cassini's method for finding the parallax and magnitude
  of Sirius using telescopes. Halley questions the accuracy of the measurements due
  to the limitations of telescope resolution and the influence of atmospheric refraction.
  He also examines the impact of the Earth's movement on the observed position of
  Sirius.
