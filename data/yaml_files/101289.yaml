tldr: The author, S. Colepresse, shares his observations on the process of making
  counterfeit opal and the recovery of the art of making red-glass in Leiden. He describes
  the lively colors of the counterfeit opal and how the process involves varying degrees
  of heat to create the colors. He also mentions the production of amethyst and sapphire,
  as well as the restoration of red-glass production after a hundred-year loss.
