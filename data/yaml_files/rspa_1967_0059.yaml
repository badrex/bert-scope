tldr: This article discusses the principles and applications of circular dichroism
  (CD) in studying polypeptide structures. CD is a technique that measures the difference
  in absorption of left and right circularly polarized light by chiral molecules,
  such as polypeptides. The authors explain the relationship between CD and the electronic
  and structural properties of polypeptides, and demonstrate how CD can be used to
  study the conformation and conformational changes in polypeptides, including synthetic
  homopolymers and proteins. They also discuss the optical activity of disordered
  and helical polypeptide chains and the potential of CD as a powerful tool for understanding
  the structure-function relationships in biological macromolecules.
