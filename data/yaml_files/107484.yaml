tldr: The author, William Lambton, measured an arc on the meridian between latitudes
  8°9'38" and 18°3'23" to determine the Earth's shape and compression at the poles.
  The measurements were taken using triangulation and chain measurements, and the
  results were used to calculate the mean degree of the Earth's surface. This work
  contributed to the understanding of the Earth's shape and helped in the development
  of surveying techniques.
