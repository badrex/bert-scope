tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the process by which bacteria
  liquefy gelatin. They discovered that bacteria produce a soluble enzyme that can
  dissolve gelatin without the need for active bacterial growth. The study also found
  that the enzyme's action can be isolated and demonstrated on other protein-rich
  substances.
