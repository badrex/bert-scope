tldr: This article investigates the Gortler vortex instability mechanism in three-dimensional
  boundary layers, focusing on the flow over an infinitely long swept cylinder with
  variable curvature. The study shows how the structure of the instability changes
  as the crossflow and chordwise flow ratios increase, and how the Gortler instability
  mechanism may not be operational in certain regimes. The findings have implications
  for laminar-flow airfoils and other practical situations involving three-dimensional
  boundary layers.
