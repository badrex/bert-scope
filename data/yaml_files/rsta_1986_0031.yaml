tldr: This article discusses the potential for reactivation of extensional fault systems
  in the continental lithosphere. It examines the geometry of these fault systems
  and their mechanical considerations, focusing on their potential for reactivation
  and the styles of reactivation. The article also highlights the importance of fault
  orientation in the stress field and the role of fluids within fault zones in influencing
  their tendency to be reactivated.
