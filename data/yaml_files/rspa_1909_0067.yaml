tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption of beta-rays by matter
  and found that the absorption follows a linear, not exponential, law. They also
  discovered that the absorption of beta-rays varies with their velocity. The results
  challenge previous assumptions about the homogeneity of radioactive rays and their
  absorption patterns.
