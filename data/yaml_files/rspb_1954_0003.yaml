tldr: The author's study discovered that the seminal vesicle secretion of the boar
  contains a high concentration of inositol, which exceeds the amounts found in any
  other plant or animal material. The fluid also contains other substances like fructose,
  ergothioneine, and potassium citrate. Inositol and citrate play a role in maintaining
  osmotic pressure in the seminal vesicle secretion and semen of the boar. The study
  provides information on the chemical composition of the vesicular secretion, including
  the presence of various carbohydrates, amino-sugars, proteins, and minerals.
