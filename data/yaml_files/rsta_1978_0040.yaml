tldr: This article discusses the relationship between terrestrial heat and magma generation,
  with a focus on the lunar core hypothesis. The authors present transfer functions
  based on seismic surface wave theory for a 3-layer Moon with varying core conductivities.
  They explore the possibility of a lunar metal core and provide revised data on core
  sizes and conductivities.
