tldr: This study measures the in-cylinder flow of a motored four-stroke reciprocating
  engine, focusing on the mean and r.m.s. components of swirl velocity during the
  intake and compression strokes. The results show the influence of compression on
  the flow patterns and provide insight into the air motion within the engine, which
  is essential for understanding its operational performance and emissions control.
