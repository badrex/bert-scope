tldr: This study examines the shallow sublittoral marine ecology of Aldabra Atoll,
  focusing on the seaward reefs of West Island. The research identifies various zones
  in the shallow sublittoral, which are determined by the nature and physiography
  of the substrate and the presence and density of marine angiosperm vegetation. The
  paper highlights the importance of understanding the marine ecology of Aldabra to
  better comprehend the complex interplay of physical and biological processes shaping
  tropical shores.
