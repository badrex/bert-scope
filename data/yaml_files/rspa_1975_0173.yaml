tldr: The article presents a multipolar susceptibility formalism for interpreting
  and mapping the isotropic magnetic shielding outside non-spherical molecules. The
  method involves spheroidal harmonic expansions of the local magnetic fields, providing
  more accurate descriptions of magnetic shielding for non-spherical molecules than
  previous methods. This formalism is particularly relevant for molecules with prolate
  or oblate shapes, such as acetylene, helical polymers, benzene, and metalloporphyrins.
