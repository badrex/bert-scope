tldr: The authors discovered micro-trabeculae in human term fetal membranes, which
  are structures similar to basement membranes but with smaller dimensions. These
  trabecular structures contain type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen, and may be
  linked to primitive epithelial structures. The presence of these structures could
  support the view that they are integrators of extracellular matrix polymeric proteins.
