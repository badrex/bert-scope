tldr: The authors calculated vibrational relaxation times in gaseous sulphur dioxide
  using the collision theory of Schwartz and Herzfeld. They found two major effective
  relaxation times, one associated with the lowest mode and the other with the two
  higher modes. The results were compared with recent ultrasonic dispersion data,
  showing a measure of agreement. The mechanism of vibrational excitation in sulphur
  dioxide was discussed, and tentative predictions were made about the relaxation
  behavior of other molecules.
