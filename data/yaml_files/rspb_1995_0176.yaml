tldr: This study examines historical changes in parental care in shorebirds, a diverse
  group of birds with various care patterns. The authors test two hypotheses for the
  direction of change and compare their findings with parallel studies of fishes.
  They find that biparental care was ancestral in shorebirds, with numerous independent
  reductions in care by males and more evolutionary lability in female care. These
  findings complement studies of contemporary selection and suggest that biparental
  incubation and freedom from feeding the young may facilitate early abandonment by
  either sex, particularly males.
