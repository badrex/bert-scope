tldr: The article discusses the life and work of Archibald Garrod, a pioneering medical
  scientist who discovered inborn errors of metabolism. Garrod's research on alkaptonuria,
  a rare metabolic disorder, laid the foundation for the field of human biochemical
  genetics. His ideas on biochemical individuality and disease were ahead of his time
  and only gained recognition after his death. The article highlights Garrod's contributions
  to science and the development of the field over the years.
