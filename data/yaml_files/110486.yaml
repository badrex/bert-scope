tldr: This article investigates the number of points at which a magnetic needle can
  take a vertical position on Earth's surface. The author demonstrates that there
  are always two points and never more than two. The study also examines the curve
  of verticity and its properties, providing insights into the magnetic curve and
  its relationship with the curve of verticity.
