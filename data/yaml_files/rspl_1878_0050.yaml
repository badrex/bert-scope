tldr: The author, Captain Abney, investigated the effect of different wavelengths
  of light on the oxidation of silver bromide emulsions. He found that the least refrangible
  end of the spectrum, or red light, accelerated the oxidation process. This discovery
  has implications for the development of photography and understanding the behavior
  of light on various materials.
