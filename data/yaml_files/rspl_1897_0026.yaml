tldr: The author conducted experiments to understand how the penetrative value of
  X-rays can be manipulated. They discovered that factors such as vacuum, electrical
  power, resistance, distance between cathode and anti-cathode, and cathode size affect
  the penetrative value of X-rays. The author also found that X-rays are more penetrative
  when the average velocity of the molecules and the difference of potential between
  them and the anti-cathode are higher.
