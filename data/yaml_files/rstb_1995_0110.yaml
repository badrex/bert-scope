tldr: This article discusses the evolution of gene regulation in eukaryotic cells.
  It explains how principles from prokaryotes apply to eukaryotes and how control
  elements could have been combined during evolution. The article also highlights
  the understanding of development in Drosophila, which can be described as a series
  of genetic switches.
