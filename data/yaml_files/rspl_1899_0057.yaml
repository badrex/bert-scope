tldr: The author investigates the spectrum of silicium and its presence in various
  stellar spectra. They discover that silicium lines can be divided into three sets,
  each behaving differently under varying electrical conditions. The author also observes
  that silicium appears at different temperatures in stars, with some lines being
  short-lived in stellar spectra.
