tldr: This article investigates the flexure of thick circular plates and the boundary
  conditions that affect their deflections. The author discusses various types of
  solutions and their limitations, emphasizing the need for a new type of analysis
  for thick plates. The study focuses on stress analysis and the use of cylindrical
  coordinates to understand the behavior of these plates under pressure.
