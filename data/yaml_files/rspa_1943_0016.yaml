tldr: The authors developed a new technique to study the continuous absorption of
  light in potassium vapour, overcoming previous difficulties with measuring atomic
  and molecular absorption. They found that at short wavelengths, atomic absorption
  increases rapidly and varies linearly with frequency. The results, however, conflict
  with existing theory, suggesting that exchange effects may be at play in the absorption
  process.
