tldr: The author, William Borlase, discovered submerged trees on the shore at Mount's
  Bay in Cornwall. The trees, including oak, hazel, and willow, were found buried
  under the sand and submerged in water. Borlase used this discovery to support the
  local tradition that St. Michael's Mount once stood in a wooded area. He also discussed
  the implications of earthquake subsidence and its relationship to the preservation
  of the trees and the potential for future earthquakes.
