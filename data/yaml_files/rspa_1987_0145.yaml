tldr: The authors studied the effect of potential energy surfaces on the dissociation
  rate constant for fluorine molecules in an argon bath at 3000 K using the Monte
  Carlo classical trajectory method. They constructed three potential surfaces with
  varying degrees of anharmonicity and found that the most anharmonic potential yielded
  the largest rate constant. However, the calculated rate constants were five to six
  times larger than the experimental values, suggesting that classical mechanics may
  not accurately describe the system.
