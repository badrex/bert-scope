tldr: The authors studied the skull morphology of Holocephali, a group of primitive
  living fishes, and compared it with the skulls of other fish groups. They found
  that Holocephali have a unique attachment of the pterygo-quadrate to the braincase
  and a complete otic process. Their research suggests that Holocephali represent
  the most primitive living Gnathostomes known and have important implications for
  understanding the evolution of fish skulls.
