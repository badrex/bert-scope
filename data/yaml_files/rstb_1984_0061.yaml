tldr: This article discusses the effects of acidic aerosol, fog, mist, and rain on
  crops and trees. It examines the physical and chemical properties of these atmospheric
  precipitation components and their influence on plant health. The study highlights
  the importance of meteorological factors, such as wind, humidity, and temperature,
  in determining the deposition rates and potential impacts on vegetation. The article
  also explores the chemical composition of acidic precipitation and its potential
  effects on plant nutrition and processes occurring at the leaf surface-atmosphere
  interface.
