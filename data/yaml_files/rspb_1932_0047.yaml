tldr: 'The author investigates the heat production in nerves during and after nerve
  impulses. They discover that heat production occurs in two phases: initial and recovery.
  The initial heat is found to be less significant, while the recovery heat continues
  for several minutes after the impulse. The author also discusses the limitations
  of current methods for measuring initial heat and the importance of understanding
  the nature of the nervous impulse.'
