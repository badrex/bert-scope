tldr: The authors analyze the probability of losing bulkheads and the subsequent effect
  on the chances of a ship sinking due to torpedo attacks. They determine the optimal
  spacing of bulkheads to maximize protection while minimizing the impact on loading
  and unloading efficiency. The study focuses on cargo steamers and considers the
  type of vessel, freeboard, permeability, and floodable length.
