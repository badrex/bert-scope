tldr: The authors discuss the role of individual enzymes in the activation of amino
  acids during lactation. They argue that amino-acid activation is catalyzed by individual
  enzymes, rather than by soluble RNA, and that the specificity of activation is determined
  by these enzymes. The findings support the conclusion that amino-acid activation
  is a crucial step in the process of lactation and protein synthesis.
