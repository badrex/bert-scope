tldr: This study investigates the storm surges in the North Sea from 11 to 30 December
  1954. The authors analyze the effects of wind patterns and pressure changes on sea
  levels, finding that winds from the west of the British Isles play a significant
  role in these events. The research also explores the influence of the Straits of
  Dover and the existence of seiches, or standing waves, in the sea.
