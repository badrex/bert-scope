tldr: The authors measured the temperature dependence of the resistivity of ferromagnetic
  metals, nickel and gadolinium. They found that for nickel, the results agree with
  band-structure calculations, while for gadolinium, the fractional change in resistivity
  is almost equal to the fourth power of the reduced magnetization. The study helps
  to understand the behavior of ferromagnetic materials and their resistivity at different
  temperatures.
