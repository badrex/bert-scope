tldr: This article discusses the relationship between the fibrinolytic and kinin systems
  in blood plasma. The author explores the molecular aspects of the proteolytic enzyme
  system and its connection to the kininogenase-kininase system. The study focuses
  on the influence of proteolysis on the kinin system and the role of peptide hydrolase
  enzymes in regulating the release and destruction of plasma kinins. The author also
  investigates the potentiation of bradykinin and its connection to the activation
  of plasminogen and kallikreinogen systems.
