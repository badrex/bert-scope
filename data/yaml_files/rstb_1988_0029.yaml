tldr: 'This article examines the evolution of climatic variability in the North Atlantic
  region over the past four million years, focusing on the marine climates of the
  U.S. Atlantic coast. The study uses ostracod fauna to analyze changes in water temperature
  and regional climate, revealing two distinct modes of marine climatic and sea-level
  changes: a gradual, directional Pliocene warming and a quasi-cyclic, high-amplitude,
  high-frequency middle-late Pleistocene pattern of alternating glacials and interglacials.'
