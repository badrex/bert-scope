tldr: 'The study examines motoneuron activity patterns in spinal dogfish during different
  types of swimming movements. Two groups of motoneurons were identified based on
  their activity patterns: Group I, which was inactive during Active swimming, and
  Group II, which fired bursts of action potentials in phase with motor nerve activity.
  The researchers suggest that Group II motoneurons innervate the red and superficial
  muscle fibers, while Group I motoneurons innervate the white muscle fibers. These
  different activity patterns likely reflect the distinct roles of the red and white
  muscle systems during locomotion.'
