tldr: This article presents an extension of Waring's problem, which deals with the
  representation of large numbers as sums of k-th powers. The authors develop two
  methods to discuss this problem, one based on the Hardy method and the other on
  the Vinogradov method. They improve upon previous results and provide new insights
  into the representation of numbers as sums of powers. The findings have implications
  for number theory, algebraic geometry, and Diophantine equations.
