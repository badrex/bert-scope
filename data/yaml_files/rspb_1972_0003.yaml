tldr: This study investigates the effects of selection and migration on the geotactic
  and phototactic behavior of Drosophila pseudoobscura. The researchers found that
  populations subjected to artificial selection became positively or negatively phototactic
  or geotactic. When selection was discontinued, populations showed genetic homeostasis,
  gradually converging to similar behaviors. Additionally, when positive and negative
  populations exchanged migrants, they converged towards identical behaviors, but
  the points of convergence were influenced by genetic homeostasis. The study's findings
  suggest that genetic homeostasis plays a crucial role in shaping the behavior of
  populations and can counteract the effects of selection.
