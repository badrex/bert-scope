tldr: This study investigates the distribution of cytoskeletal and syncytioskeletal
  proteins in the human placenta near term using immunocytochemical and ultrastructural
  methods. The researchers discovered a syncytioskeletal layer that covers the villous
  tree, providing potential support for placental structure and morphogenesis. The
  findings contribute to understanding the complex shape and growth of chorionic villi
  in the human placenta.
