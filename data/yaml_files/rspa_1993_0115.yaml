tldr: This article explores the implications of Dirac's work on the self-energy of
  a charged particle in classical electrodynamics. The authors argue that by adopting
  a global cosmological perspective, the issues of divergent integrals in classical
  and quantum electrodynamics can be resolved. They also discuss the role of the universe's
  response in avoiding infinities in quantum electrodynamics.
