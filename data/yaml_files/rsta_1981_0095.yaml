tldr: This article discusses the development of conceptual designs for deuterium-tritium
  (D-T) fusion electricity generating plants. It reviews the additional physical and
  technological requirements for fusion reactors and presents two conceptual designs.
  The article also assesses the anticipated advantages and costs of fusion energy
  and proposes possible time-scales for the development of fusion power.
