tldr: The authors studied the local circuitry in the intermediate part of the medial
  hyperstriatum ventrale (IMHV) of the domestic chick using an in vitro slice preparation.
  They discovered that the IMHV is involved in neural changes that underlie behavioral
  plasticity, such as imprinting and passive avoidance learning. The study provides
  insights into the physiological and pharmacological properties of the locally evoked
  field response in the IMHV.
