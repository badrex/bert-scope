tldr: The authors conducted experiments on single Pacinian corpuscles in the cat's
  mesentery to study the initiation of nerve impulses. They found that the minimum
  movement required to excite a single corpuscle was 100 microns, and that subthreshold
  mechanical stimuli could facilitate stimulation by electrical test shocks. The results
  can be explained in terms of the known properties of axons, without the need for
  any other intermediate mechanisms. This research provides more information on the
  fundamental mechanism of sensory receptors.
