tldr: The author, John Wray, describes the manner in which spiders project their threads
  and fly. He discusses various observations, such as the speed of spider flight,
  the way spiders shoot their threads, and the purpose of forking their threads. Wray
  also mentions how spiders secure their threads to prevent them from being blown
  away by the wind. The author acknowledges the contributions of Dr. Hulse and Mr.
  Martin Lister in the study of spider behavior.
