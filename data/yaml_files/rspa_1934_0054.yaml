tldr: This article presents a study on the diffraction of electrons in halogens, such
  as iodine and bromine, using a specialized apparatus. The results show similarities
  between the diffraction patterns of these halogens, which can be explained by the
  structure of their outer electron shells. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of atomic structure and electron scattering in different elements.
