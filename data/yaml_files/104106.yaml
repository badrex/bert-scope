tldr: The author, Joseph Atwell, presents conjectures on the nature of intermitting
  and reciprocating springs, specifically focusing on a fountain in Laywell, near
  Torbay in Devonshire. He observes the fountain's regular increase and decrease in
  water flow and discusses the possible factors influencing these phenomena. Atwell's
  observations and conjectures provide insights into the behavior of springs and contribute
  to the understanding of natural phenomena.
