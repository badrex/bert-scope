tldr: This study investigates the scattering processes of atomic particles with solid
  surfaces at intermediate energies. The authors measured the energy distributions
  of charged particles emitted from various targets bombarded by atomic and molecular
  positive ions. They found that scattering of incident particles is predominantly
  elastic and approximately independent of the charge state of the incident particle.
  The energy distribution of negatively charged scattered ions is generally broader
  than that for positively charged scattered ions at the same incident energy, especially
  for lighter ions.
