tldr: The authors present a simple modification of Christie's method for determining
  lung volume, which involves maintaining a constant volume of inspired air by adding
  oxygen at a uniform rate to the spirometer. This modification eliminates the error
  introduced by assuming an unaltered concentration of nitrogen in the lung air, making
  the method more accurate and suitable for clinical investigations.
