tldr: The author examines the remains of a recently extinct volcano in the Mediterranean
  and collects samples of gas rising from its site. The gas is found to be composed
  of about 10% oxygen and 90% nitrogen, with no signs of flammability or smell of
  sulfur. The author speculates that the gas may have originated from the sea water
  interacting with the hot volcanic materials, rather than directly from the volcano
  itself.
