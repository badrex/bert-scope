tldr: The authors developed a method to estimate kojic acid in the presence of glucose
  using the iodine absorption method. They discovered that kojic acid reacts quantitatively
  with iodine in alkaline solution, and they investigated the reaction mechanism,
  products, and conditions for accurate estimation. This method can be used to follow
  the production of kojic acid by certain molds.
