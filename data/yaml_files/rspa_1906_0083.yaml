tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effects of radium and certain
  metallic salts on gelatin. They discovered that radium, barium, strontium, and lead
  salts cause a growth in gelatin, which is due to the formation of precipitates.
  The growth appears to have a cellular structure, but it is not a living organism.
  The experiments show that there is no connection between radioactivity and the formation
  of the growth.
