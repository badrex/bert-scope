tldr: The author conducted experiments using a whirling machine to improve the accuracy
  of cup anemometer constants. They found that comparing two similar anemometers with
  different frictions could help account for the uncertainty caused by the air's vorticose
  motion. The author also developed a new method for measuring brake friction during
  experiments, which led to more accurate results.
