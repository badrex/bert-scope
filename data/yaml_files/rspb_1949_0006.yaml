tldr: This article develops a mathematical theory of genetical recombination, focusing
  on long-chromosome arms. The author assumes a special interference metric specifying
  the positions of loci and independent probability distributions for the metrical
  lengths of intercepts formed by exchange points. The article provides general analytical
  expressions for genotically observable quantities, such as map distance and recombination,
  and introduces a formula for map distance and recombination involving a disposable
  constant related to interference intensity. The author also discusses the limitations
  of previous theories and the need for a more comprehensive approach.
