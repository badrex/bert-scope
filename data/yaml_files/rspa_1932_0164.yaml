tldr: The authors conducted an experiment to study the scattering of fast beta-particles
  by electrons using the expansion method. They found that both the exchange effect
  suggested by Mott and the effect of relativity reduce the scattering much below
  that predicted classically. The results showed good agreement with Moller's formula,
  indicating that the scattering of fast beta-particles by electrons is influenced
  by both relativistic and quantum effects.
