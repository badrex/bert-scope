tldr: The article explores baryon decays in the U(6) ⊗ U(6) ⊗ U(3) symmetry scheme,
  calculating two-body decay widths for the lowest submultiplets. The study considers
  octet-octet mixing and accounts for mass splitting using average masses. The results
  provide insights into the decay widths and help understand the behavior of baryons
  in the symmetry scheme.
