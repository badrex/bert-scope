tldr: The author presents a dynamical theory of the electric and luminiferous medium,
  considering the medium as continuous and reducing the problem to a line integral
  along the wire. The potentials are expressed in terms of ideal mass-distributions
  of densities, providing a new approach to understanding the behavior of electric
  and luminiferous mediums.
