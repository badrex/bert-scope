tldr: The study examines how toads navigate and perceive their environment, specifically
  their ability to display size constancy. Toads were observed as they approached
  mealworms through obstacles, such as picket fences. The results showed that toads
  have both depth and size constancy, allowing them to plan their routes accurately
  based on the real size and distance of objects in their surroundings.
