tldr: The authors present a new method for the reduced silver impregnation of arthropod
  central nervous systems, which provides reliable results without using buffered
  solutions, low silver concentrations, or prolonged incubation times. The method
  involves treating sections with a mercury-cobalt-nitric acid bath before using an
  urea-silver nitrate bath, resulting in better differentiation and impregnation of
  the nervous tissues.
