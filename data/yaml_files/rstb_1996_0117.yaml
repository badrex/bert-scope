tldr: This study investigates the fast-slow continuum hypothesis in plant life histories,
  examining the relationship between adult mortality rates, age at sexual maturity,
  and fecundity in 83 species of perennial plants. The results show that plants with
  higher adult mortality rates have shorter lifespans and reach sexual maturity at
  an earlier age, aligning with the fast-slow continuum theory. However, the monotonically
  increasing fecundity in plants prevents testing the positive relationship between
  mortality and fecundity.
