tldr: The study investigates the vertical migration behavior of eyeless Daphnia, revealing
  that these organisms can carry out a vertical migration determined solely by light
  intensity. The experiments show that eyeless Daphnia exhibit a photokinetic response,
  including an inhibition of movement at high light intensities, but no phototactic
  response. This suggests that other photosensitive systems, rather than the compound
  eye, are involved in controlling the photokinetic activation and inhibition.
