tldr: This article develops an expression for the fluid loading on a circular cylinder
  due to classical inviscid, irrotational, and incompressible flow. The cylinder has
  an arbitrary rigid body movement, and the fluid has an arbitrary flow pattern. The
  result is intended to be used as the "inertia" force component of wave loading on
  the cylindrical members of offshore structures in Morison's Equation formulation.
  The article extends these results to allow for the cylinder to be moving, considering
  translation and rotation of the structure. The force per unit length acting on the
  cylinder is calculated using pressure integration and the velocity potential of
  the fluid flow.
