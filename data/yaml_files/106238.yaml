tldr: The author presents a new theory to calculate the motion of a rotating body
  when affected by forces disturbing its rotation. The theory is applied to the motion
  of the Earth's axis due to the attraction of the Sun and Moon, which has not been
  fully explained by previous mathematicians. The author's calculations involve the
  angular velocities, radii, and forces acting on the body, leading to the determination
  of the new axis of rotation.
