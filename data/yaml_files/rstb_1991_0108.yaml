tldr: This article explores the foraging strategies and dietary selection of baboons,
  combining flexibility and breadth with selectivity. The authors develop and test
  multivariate models to understand the basis of diet selection for montane and savannah
  baboons. They find that food selection is positively related to protein and lipid
  content and negatively to fiber, phenolics, and alkaloids. The study highlights
  the adaptability of baboons in various habitats and their ability to extract nutrients
  from different food sources, making them successful in their environments.
