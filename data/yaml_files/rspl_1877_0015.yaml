tldr: The author conducted experiments with Leyden jars and vacuum tubes to study
  the behavior of electrical discharges. They discovered that the discharge form changes
  from stratified to unstratified as the charge increases. The experiments also showed
  that the tension, rather than the quantity, determines the character of the discharge.
  The findings contribute to the understanding of gas discharge phenomena and electromagnetic
  theory.
