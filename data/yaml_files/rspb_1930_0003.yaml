tldr: The author conducted experiments to study the effect of oxygen concentrations
  on the movement of amoebae. They found that amoeboid movement depends on anaerobic
  processes, but oxygen is required for a recovery process. The experiments showed
  that the duration of movement increases with increased partial pressure of oxygen,
  and that the recovery process is slower when oxygen is insufficient. The results
  suggest that there is a critical oxygen pressure below which amoeboid movement is
  progressively curtailed.
