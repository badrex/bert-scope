tldr: The author compares the coxal glands of Scorpio and Limulus, finding that they
  have similar large and prominent structures at the junction of the ambulatory limbs
  with the body. The coxal glands in Scorpio are oblong white bodies resting upon
  the sternal prolongations of the hind limbs, while in Limulus, they are brick-red
  glands situated at the base of the cephalothoracic limbs. This discovery supports
  the close affinity between Scorpio and Limulus, as both are members of the class
  Arachnida.
