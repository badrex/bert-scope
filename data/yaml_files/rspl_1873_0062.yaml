tldr: This article discusses the absorption spectra of potassium and sodium at low
  temperatures. The authors, H. E. Roscoe and Arthur Schuster, conducted experiments
  using glass tubes filled with hydrogen and a large Steinheil spectroscope. They
  observed a complicated absorption spectrum with bands in the red, blue, and yellow
  regions. The authors measured the wavelengths of the bands and analyzed the results,
  providing insights into the behavior of potassium and sodium at low temperatures.
