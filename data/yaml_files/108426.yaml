tldr: The author, John Stenhouse, explores the potential of obtaining artificial alkaloids
  from highly nitrogenated principles found in plants, such as vegetable albumen,
  fibrine, and caseine. He conducts experiments using horse-bean seeds and distills
  them to obtain various organic bases, including aniline, quinoline, picoline, and
  petenine. The process involves multiple steps of distillation, filtration, and neutralization
  to isolate the desired bases.
