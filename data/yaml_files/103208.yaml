tldr: Edward Lhwyd describes a remarkable sea plant found near Llan Danwg in Meirionydshire,
  Wales. The plant has hollow stems filled with a reddish liquid and drooping flowers.
  Lhwyd also mentions the discovery of a unique marble with a pattern resembling small
  oranges, which could be used for inlaying work. Additionally, he discusses the availability
  of alum and copperas in Pembrokeshire, Caermarthenshire, and Meirionydshire for
  potential mining and industrial projects.
