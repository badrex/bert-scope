tldr: This article presents experimental results on the absorption and scattering
  of X-rays by various elements. The authors analyze the data using classical and
  quantum theories, finding that the scattering is proportional to the atomic number
  and that the observed absorption and scattering exceed theoretical predictions for
  shorter wavelengths. The results support the identification of two terms in the
  absorption coefficient, representing scattering and true absorption.
