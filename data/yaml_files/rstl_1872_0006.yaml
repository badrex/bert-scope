tldr: The author, George Biddell Airy, presents corrections to the computed wave-lengths
  of light published in the Philosophical Transactions of the year 1868. He used a
  graphical process to compare and correct the wave-lengths, taking into account the
  measurements of Angstrom and Ditscheiner. The corrections were made to improve the
  accuracy of the wave-lengths for various spectral lines, including those of the
  atmosphere and metals.
