tldr: This article describes a series of experiments conducted to compare the standard
  barometers of the Royal Observatory, Greenwich, and the Kew Observatory. The authors
  found a mean difference of 0.0012 inches between the two observatories, after accounting
  for various factors such as temperature and index errors. The results provide valuable
  information for improving the accuracy of atmospheric pressure measurements in these
  important establishments.
