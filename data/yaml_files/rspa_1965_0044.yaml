tldr: This study investigates the stability of viscous flow between rotating cylinders
  using an ion technique. The authors determine the critical Taylor number, wavenumber,
  and waveform of the disturbances. They also observe the growth and decay of vortices
  as the Taylor number changes. The results are compared with theoretical values obtained
  from the integration of exact equations for the linear stability problem. The findings
  provide insights into the behavior of fluid dynamics in rotating systems.
