tldr: The authors present a general theory for the angular distribution of photoelectrons
  ejected from diatomic molecules. They develop expressions for the anisotropy parameter
  and the total cross-section, which can be used to study molecular ionization potentials
  and orbital energies. The theory is applicable to transitions between individual
  rotational levels and can provide valuable information about the symmetry of the
  molecular orbital from which photoelectrons are ejected. This information supplements
  the data available from band shapes and Franck-Condon factors.
