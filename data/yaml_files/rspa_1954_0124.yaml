tldr: The article investigates the formation of cracks in metals as a result of plastic
  flow. It examines the stress concentration around a group of dislocations and determines
  that a crack should form when the group consists of about 1000 dislocations under
  a stress of the magnitude found in cold-worked metals. The stress system due to
  the crack is obtained, and it is found that the crack will have a stable equilibrium
  length, which is likely to be determined by the amount of plastic flow that occurs
  around the crack tip.
