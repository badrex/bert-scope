tldr: This article discusses the microbial population and processes in aquatic sediments,
  focusing on the decomposition and modification of organic matter. It highlights
  the importance of electron acceptors, bioturbation, and the presence of specific
  decomposer microbes in the sediment. The article also explores the role of anaerobic
  bacteria in carbon turnover and the use of biomarkers to identify zones of microbial
  activity.
