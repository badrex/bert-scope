tldr: Dr. Wilson observed the eclipse of Jupiter's first satellite at the Glasgow
  Observatory and compared it with previous observations to determine the difference
  in meridians between Greenwich and Glasgow. He used De la Caille's Ephemeris for
  the equation of time. The observations were made at Mr. Short's house in Surrey
  Street, which is 26.5 time units west of Greenwich.
