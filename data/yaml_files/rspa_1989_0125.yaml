tldr: The authors present a logic specifically designed for analyzing authentication
  protocols in distributed computing systems. This logic allows for a precise understanding
  of the differences between various protocols and their required initial assumptions
  and final beliefs. The authors demonstrate the application of this logic to protocols
  using shared-key cryptography and public-key cryptography, highlighting its potential
  for answering questions about the effectiveness and assumptions of authentication
  protocols.
