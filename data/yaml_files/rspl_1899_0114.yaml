tldr: This article discusses experiments conducted to determine the effects of extreme
  cold on bacteria. The researchers cooled bacteria down to -190°C for seven days
  using liquid air. Despite the extreme conditions, no significant damage to the bacteria's
  vitality was observed. This finding expands our understanding of how life can survive
  in harsh environments.
