tldr: This article examines gravitational fields containing bounded sources and gravitational
  radiation by analyzing their properties at spatial infinity. The author presents
  a method for integrating the field equations and analyzes the asymptotic behavior
  of the metric and Riemann tensors for large spatial distances. The study reveals
  that gravitational waves appear to carry mass away from the interior and suggests
  a superposition principle for the radiation modes of the gravitational field.
