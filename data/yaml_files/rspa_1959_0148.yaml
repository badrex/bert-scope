tldr: The authors investigate the influence of higher-order terms in the dielectric
  constant of ionic crystals, specifically the anharmonic terms in the potential energy
  and the higher-order terms in the dipole moment. They find that these terms contribute
  to the static dielectric constant and can affect the infra-red absorption spectrum.
  The study suggests that the long-range dipolar interactions between the first- and
  second-order moments may be responsible for the variations in the intensity and
  width of the infra-red bands in ionic crystals.
