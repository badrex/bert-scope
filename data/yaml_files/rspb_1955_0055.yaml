tldr: The author investigates the phenomenon of affinity in genetic segregation, specifically
  in hybrids between different subspecies of mice. They suggest that there is a tendency
  for centromeres of similar ancestral origin to segregate to the same pole of the
  cell, resulting in apparent linkages between unlinked loci. This phenomenon, called
  affinity, could have adaptive significance in evolution and is explored further
  through various experiments and data analysis.
