tldr: This study investigates the relationship between tendon thickness, collagen
  content, and muscle strength in rabbits. The researchers found that the maximum
  tension transmitted by collagen in tendons of fusiform muscles was significantly
  greater than that in penniform muscles. Tendon thickness was also found to be relatively
  higher in slow, red, fusiform muscles compared to fast, white muscles. These findings
  provide insights into the factors that determine tendon size and its role in muscle
  function.
