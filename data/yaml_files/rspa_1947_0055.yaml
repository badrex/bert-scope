tldr: The author studied the 2.7-day activity in gold isotope 198Au by using a / 7-spectrometer
  and a special technique for studying y-radiation. They found that gold irradiated
  with slow neutrons has a strong activity with a half-life of 2.7 days, which must
  be due to the gold isotope 198Au. The author also investigated the y-radiation properties
  and the / 7-spectrum, discovering only one y-ray of medium energy (0.401 MeV) following
  the / 7-disintegration.
