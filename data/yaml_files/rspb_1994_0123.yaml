tldr: Researchers discovered a pore-forming protein in the whipworm Trichuris, which
  could help the parasite maintain its syncytial environment in the host's gut. This
  finding may lead to potential avenues for drug and vaccine development against trichuriasis,
  a common helminth parasitic disease affecting millions of people worldwide.
