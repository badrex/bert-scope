tldr: The authors studied the fine structure of neurons and interstitial cells in
  the nervous system of the giant African land snail, Archachatina marginata, using
  electron microscopy. They discovered different types of interstitial cells, including
  sheath cells, glial cells, and supporting cells, which play various roles in the
  nervous system. The study provides insights into the complex structure and function
  of neurons and interstitial cells in the snail's nervous system, which may have
  implications for understanding the nervous systems of other animals.
