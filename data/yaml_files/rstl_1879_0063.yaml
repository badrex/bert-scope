tldr: The author investigates the effects of stress on the magnetization of iron,
  nickel, and cobalt. They found that stress can either increase or decrease the magnetization
  depending on the type of stress and the material. This research helps to understand
  the relationship between mechanical and magnetic properties of materials, which
  is essential for various technological applications.
