tldr: This study investigates the properties of gold-aluminium alloys and their freezing
  points. The authors add varying amounts of aluminium to gold and measure the freezing
  points of the resulting alloys. They also analyze the alloys microscopically and
  chemically to understand the composition and behavior of these binary alloys. The
  research provides insights into the formation and properties of gold-aluminium alloys,
  which can be useful for future material science and metallurgical applications.
