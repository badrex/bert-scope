tldr: The article investigates the propagation of waves in the crust of dense magnetic
  stars, specifically studying the effects of magnetic fields on wave speeds. It demonstrates
  that there are universal relations between the speeds of fast and slow magnetoelastic
  modes, which do not depend on the exact equation of state of the body. These findings
  are relevant to understanding wave motion in solid stars and can be applied to various
  directions of the magnetic field and different magnitudes of strains.
