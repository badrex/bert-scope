tldr: The article presents an account of the molecular orbital theory of chemical
  valency, focusing on the properties of the electronic charge density function in
  the first and higher approximations. It applies this theory to conjugated molecules,
  providing a simple understanding of the relationship between bond order and bond
  length in both symmetrical and unsymmetrical bonds. The study also explains how
  to express any diagonal element of the charge-density matrix in terms of basic constants
  and terms accounting for differences in electron spins and charge drifts between
  orbitals.
