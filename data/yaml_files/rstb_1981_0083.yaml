tldr: The study investigates the organization of dermatomes and afferent myotomes
  in the upper limb using electrophysiological techniques on ten African green monkeys.
  The research reveals that the cutaneous region served by one spinal nerve is wider
  and more variable in location than previously recognized. The findings also show
  that most muscles of the limb receive afferent innervation from three to four different
  spinal nerves, and the territory of the myotome does not necessarily coincide with
  the dermatome of the same spinal nerve. This has important implications for diagnosing
  spinal nerve injuries.
