tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the factors influencing the
  growth of normal and malignant cells in fluid culture media, specifically focusing
  on mouse tumors. They found that different strains of transplantable tumors exhibit
  individual differences when grown in serum, and even tumors of the same strain show
  marked differences from time to time. The type of growth and its extent are influenced
  by the source of the serum, whether it is homologous or heterologous. The study
  highlights the complexity of factors that affect tumor growth in serum and warns
  against the use of serum cultures for therapeutic experiments due to the potential
  for cell detachment and degeneration.
