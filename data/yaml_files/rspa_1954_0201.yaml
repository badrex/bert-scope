tldr: This article presents a mathematical approach to define and evaluate Feynman's
  integral over all paths, a concept used in quantum mechanics. The author develops
  a technique to define this integral for a free particle and extends it to cases
  with a potential independent of velocity. The article also discusses the properties
  and applications of the integral, including its connection to Green's functions.
