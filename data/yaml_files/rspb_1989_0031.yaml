tldr: This study investigates ocular vergence and gaze shifts between real targets
  differing in distance and direction. The research focuses on symmetrical and asymmetrical
  vergence responses, finding that asymmetrical vergence is largely saccadic, while
  symmetrical vergence is primarily smooth. The results suggest that the oculomotor
  system is capable of effective binocular vision under natural conditions, despite
  previous observations suggesting otherwise.
