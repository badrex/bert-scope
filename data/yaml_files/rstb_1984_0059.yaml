tldr: This study investigates the long-term effects of sulfur dioxide (SO2) exposure
  on crop growth and yield. The authors analyzed data from 125 experiments involving
  21 different crops exposed to constant SO2 concentrations in chambers. They found
  a linear relationship between SO2 concentration and percentage yield loss. The results
  show that there is significant variability in response between species and within
  different exposure chambers. The authors discuss the factors that contribute to
  this variability and the implications for dose-response relations used in cost-benefit
  analysis of SO2 emission control.
