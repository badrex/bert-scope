tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption spectra of various
  media, such as orange glass, ruby glass, and cobalt glass, using a thermopile. They
  found that these media absorb different parts of the spectrum, which can affect
  photography and other applications. The authors also discovered that green glass,
  which is used in thermometer bulbs, does not completely absorb infra-red rays, and
  they suggest looking for other coloring materials for this purpose.
