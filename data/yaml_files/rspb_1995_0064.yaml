tldr: This study uses single-locus DNA fingerprinting to investigate the relationship
  between male age and extra-pair paternity in house sparrows. The results show that
  older males have a higher reproductive success through extra-pair paternity, resulting
  in an average reproductive output 36% higher than that of yearlings. This discovery
  challenges the idea that older males are chosen for their high quality, as they
  are cuckolded at the same rate as other males.
