tldr: The author presents a method to determine the amount of radium and thorium in
  minerals using emanation. They describe the process of extracting and measuring
  the emanation produced by radium and thorium in minerals, and compare the results
  with a standard specimen of radium bromide. This research helps in understanding
  the properties and behavior of radioactive minerals and their potential applications
  in various fields.
