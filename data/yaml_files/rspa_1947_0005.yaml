tldr: This study measures the drag exerted by the earth's surface on the wind and
  determines von Karman's constant for the lower atmosphere. The research uses a horizontal
  plate floating in oil and under torsional control to observe the deflection caused
  by the wind. Simultaneous measurements of the velocity profile above the surface
  help deduce von Karman's constant, which is found to vary with atmospheric stability.
  The observations also provide insight into the variation of mixing length with height.
