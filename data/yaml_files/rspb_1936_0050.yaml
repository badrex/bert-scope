  Auditory Stimuli'

tldr: The authors investigate the auditory receptors in insects, specifically the
  tympanal organs and hair sensilla in Orthoptera. They use advanced equipment to
  analyze the electrical response of these receptors to various frequencies and intensities
  of sound. The cricket's anal cercus, which contains long, slender sense-hairs, is
  found to be the receptor responsible for detecting sound. The cricket's auditory
  spectrum is highly sensitive to low frequencies, much more so than the human ear.
  The response to sound stimuli in insects shares similarities with the mammalian
  cochlear nerve response, including phenomena like frequency-doubling and frequency-halving.
