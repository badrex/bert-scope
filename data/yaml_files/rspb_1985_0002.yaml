tldr: The article describes the transient inward current (Tin) elicited by hyperpolarization
  during serotonin, glutamate, or muscarinic receptor activation in Xenopus oocytes.
  The Tin current is mainly due to chloride ion efflux and is presumably activated
  by calcium ion influx. The current is blocked by removing calcium from the bathing
  medium, adding manganese, cobalt, or lanthanum, or by intracellular injection of
  EGTA. The Tin current may play a role in regulating the excitability of neurons
  in the central nervous system.
