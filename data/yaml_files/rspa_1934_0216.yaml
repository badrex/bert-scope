tldr: The author investigates the energies of alpha, beta, and gamma rays using radioactive
  elements like radium, thorium, and actinium. They analyze the energies of these
  rays and discuss the differences between the energies of beta and gamma rays from
  various elements. The study also examines the suspension of small particles and
  bubbles against gravity in a radiation field and its implications for the design
  of torsion balances.
