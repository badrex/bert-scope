tldr: The author, Thomas Hopkins, argues that the heat from condensing vapour is the
  cause of great currents in the air and ocean. He explains that these currents are
  created by vacua in specific locations where much vapour has been condensed, leading
  to an imbalance in atmospheric pressure. Hopkins also discusses how primary ocean
  currents are influenced by winds, which can force water to move as currents. He
  concludes that heat from vapour is the main force responsible for the continuous
  movements in both the atmosphere and the ocean.
