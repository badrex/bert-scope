tldr: The author's study on Calliphora erythrocephala larvae reveals the presence
  of a glucose dehydrogenase system in the blood and tissues. The activity of this
  system is controlled by Weismann's ring, which influences developmental processes
  during the larva's life. This dehydrogenase system is responsible for the unstable
  reducing power of the blood, leading to the inactivation of tyrosinase and the eventual
  hardening of the larval cuticle to form the puparium. The findings suggest the presence
  and later elimination of a juvenile hormone, similar to that found in Rhodnius by
  Wigglesworth.
