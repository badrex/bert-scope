tldr: The authors present a method for directly estimating maximum likelihood from
  single-channel recordings without the need for restoration. They apply this method
  to ion channel models and demonstrate its effectiveness in estimating conductance
  levels, mean dwell times, and other properties of the models. This approach offers
  improvements over previous methods, particularly in noisy environments.
