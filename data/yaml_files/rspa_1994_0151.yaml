tldr: This article investigates the occurrence of finite-time break-up singularities
  in three-dimensional unsteady interacting boundary layers, extending previous two-dimensional
  theory. The study focuses on liquid-layer flow at subcritical Froude numbers and
  flow over relatively short steep humps, providing computational and theoretical
  insights into the behavior of these complex interactions in boundary layers.
