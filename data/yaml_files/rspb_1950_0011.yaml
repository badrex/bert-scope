tldr: The authors discovered a new phosphagen in annelid and gephyrean worms, which
  they named the 'annelid phosphagen.' This phosphagen is different from arginine
  phosphate, previously assumed to be present in invertebrate muscles. The study also
  found a second phosphagen, possibly creatine phosphate, in certain annelids but
  not in gephyreans. The distribution of these phosphagens does not seem to be correlated
  with physiological activity or environmental factors. The research emphasizes the
  chemical distinction between Annelida and Gephyrea from other invertebrate groups
  and supports the echinoderm-hemichordate theory of vertebrate ancestry.
