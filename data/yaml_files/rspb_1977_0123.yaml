tldr: The article discusses the challenges of maintaining vaccine potency in developing
  countries, where storage and transportation conditions can be harsh. It outlines
  the importance of the cold chain, the need for improved refrigeration and insulation
  at peripheral storage locations, and the use of enzyme-based temperature indicators
  to monitor vaccine exposure. The author also suggests the potential use of solar-powered
  refrigerators and the development of more stable vaccines.
