tldr: The author discusses the chemosynthetic base of deep-sea ecosystems around hydrothermal
  vents, which produces organic carbon independent of sunlight. They address criticisms
  of this process and explain how it supports the existence of eukaryotic organisms
  in the absence of light. The author also highlights the role of anaerobic bacteria
  in these ecosystems and the importance of considering different electron acceptors
  in microbial physiology.
