tldr: The authors investigated the recombination of oxygen atoms on glass surfaces
  using a glass probe coated with a metal surface active for recombining oxygen atoms.
  They found that the fractional collisional efficiency of this process is independent
  of whether wet or dry oxygen is used. The efficiency was measured as the fraction
  of oxygen collisions with the surface that lead to removal and conversion to oxygen
  molecules.
