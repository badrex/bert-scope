tldr: This article presents a theoretical analysis of the inelastic scattering of
  neutrons by crystals, focusing on the diffuse reflexion phenomenon. The authors
  outline the theory and derive properties of the diffuse reflexions. They then report
  on their experimental observations of diffuse reflexions in an iron crystal and
  compare the results with the theoretical predictions. The study provides insights
  into the interaction between neutrons and phonons in crystal structures and the
  dynamics of lattices.
