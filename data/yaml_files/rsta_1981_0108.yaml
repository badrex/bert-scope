tldr: This article discusses the fate of sedimentary cover on the descending oceanic
  lithosphere at convergent plate margins and its role in the evolution of the Earth's
  continental crust. The authors argue that most of the sediment cover is either accreted
  or underplated (subcreted) to the upper plate, contributing to the growth of continental
  crust. They provide evidence from the geometry and distribution of deformation within
  accretionary prisms, lithologic variations within exposed accretionary complexes,
  and correlations of variations in the geochemistry of arc volcanics with critical
  geological variations on a global scale.
