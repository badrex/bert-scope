tldr: This study compares the physiology of the iris in two fish species, Uranoscopus
  and Lophius, and investigates the effects of various drugs and stimuli on their
  pupils. The research finds that both species have similar iris structures and respond
  to drugs like pilocarpine, acetyl choline, and adrenaline, but with varying degrees
  of constriction and dilation. The study also examines the neural pathways and the
  role of neurotransmitters in controlling the iris movements.
