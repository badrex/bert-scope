tldr: The author investigates the formation of crystallographic shear planes in molybdenum
  trioxide, a type of non-stoichiometric compound. These shear planes are chemical
  defects that occur when oxygen atoms are removed from the structure. The density
  of these planes can describe the non-stoichiometric range MoO3_x (0 < x < 0.05).
  The author also discusses the mechanism of production of these shear planes and
  compares it with other models proposed in the literature.
