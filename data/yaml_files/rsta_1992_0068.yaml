tldr: The authors conducted time-resolved macromolecular crystallography experiments
  on carbonic anhydrase using both Laue and monochromatic methods. They discovered
  that the Laue results did not agree with the expected molecular structures, so they
  recorded monochromatic datasets to confirm their findings. The study provided new
  insights into the binding of anion inhibitors and the catalytic mechanism of the
  enzyme.
