tldr: The authors studied the distribution of saturated and unsaturated fatty acids
  in synthetic triglycerides created by esterifying mixtures of saturated and unsaturated
  fatty acids with glycerol. They compared the structure of these synthetic triglycerides
  to natural fats and found that the distribution of fatty acids in vegetable seed
  fats tends to be even, while pericarp fats and animal fats have a more heterogeneous
  structure. The results showed that the proportion of fully-saturated glycerides
  in synthetic fats is determined by the molecular percentage of saturated acids present.
