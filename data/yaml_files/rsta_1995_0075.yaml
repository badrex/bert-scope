tldr: This article discusses the effects of permafrost and climate change on the geotechnical
  properties of the ground in the Arctic regions. It highlights the importance of
  understanding the behavior of frozen soils and the consequences of melting due to
  global warming. The article also explores the implications of these changes for
  the design and construction of highways, airports, buildings, and pipelines in cold
  regions.
