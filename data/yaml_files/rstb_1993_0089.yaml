tldr: The article discusses the role of xylem-transported chemical signals, particularly
  abscisic acid (ABA), in regulating plant growth and physiology under drought stress.
  The authors provide evidence that ABA, synthesized in roots, moves through the xylem
  stream to the shoot, providing a measure of the plant's water access in the soil.
  This signal can influence leaf growth, stomatal conductance, and other aspects of
  shoot physiology, helping plants adapt to water scarcity.
