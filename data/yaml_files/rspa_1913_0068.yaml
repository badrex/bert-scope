tldr: The authors investigate the paths of particles in a frictionless liquid during
  two-dimensional motion, focusing on cases involving a rotating elliptic cylinder.
  They analyze the deformation of volume elements, the behavior of particles near
  solid boundaries, and the streamlines of the liquid. The study provides insights
  into the limitations of the hydrodynamic treatment of liquids and the importance
  of molecular structure.
