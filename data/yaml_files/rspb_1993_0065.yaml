tldr: The author examines the different types of handicaps in sexual selection, specifically
  the Zahavi, revealing, and condition-dependent handicaps. They argue that these
  models are not distinct and can be considered as one type of handicap, which is
  condition-dependent. The author discusses the implications of this finding for understanding
  the evolution of male ornaments and the importance of the handicap mechanism in
  sexual selection.
