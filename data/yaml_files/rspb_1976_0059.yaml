tldr: This study investigates the presence of sodium gating currents in Myxicola giant
  axons and their relationship to the sodium conductance mechanism. The results show
  that these currents have a time course similar to those observed in squid giant
  axons, and the charge distribution curve is consistent with the Hodgkin-Huxley model
  of nerve excitation. The findings further support the idea that sodium gating currents
  play a crucial role in nerve conduction.
