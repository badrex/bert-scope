tldr: This study examines the thermal decomposition and detonation of mercury fulminate,
  a chemical compound used in the past for detonation devices. The authors found that
  the decomposition process involves a quiescent period followed by rapid acceleration,
  and that the critical temperature for detonation varies depending on experimental
  conditions. The findings contribute to the understanding of the properties and behavior
  of mercury fulminate and related compounds.
