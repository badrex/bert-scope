revised_title: Radium Emanations and Their Effects on Diamond

tldr: The author investigates the effects of radium emanations on diamonds and discovers
  that they cause a superficial darkening, converting the surface into graphite. Radium
  emanations also alter the body color of the diamond, changing it from yellow to
  a pale blue-green. This phenomenon is due to the intense phosphorescence of the
  diamond in the presence of radium, which may be a result of chemical as well as
  physical action.
