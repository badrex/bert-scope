tldr: Researchers investigated the effects of three inhibitors on 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl
  coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase in cultured rat hepatoma cells. They found that mevalonate,
  a sterol, suppresses the reductase's activity, suggesting that it may act as a repressor
  derived from mevalonate metabolism. This discovery provides insights into the regulation
  of cholesterol synthesis in cells.
