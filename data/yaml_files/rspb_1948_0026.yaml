tldr: This study investigates the genetic and antigenic basis of tumor transplantation
  and finds a close linkage between a histocompatibility gene and the 'fused' gene
  in mice. The research also suggests that serological tests are more effective than
  tumor inoculation in identifying genotypes. The findings contribute to a better
  understanding of tissue transplantation and the role of histocompatibility genes.
