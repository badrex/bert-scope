tldr: The article discusses the self-assembly of biological macromolecules, focusing
  on the folding and aggregation of proteins. It explains how genetic information
  leads to the accurate biosynthesis of primary structures, which then fold and aggregate
  to form complex tertiary and quaternary structures. The importance of molecular
  recognition and specificity in the folding and assembly processes is emphasized,
  as well as the role of water as a solvent in these processes. The article also highlights
  the evolutionary significance of aggregation and subunit interactions in increasing
  the size and complexity of proteins.
