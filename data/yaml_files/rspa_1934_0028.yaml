tldr: The authors investigated the anomalous absorption of high energy gamma radiation
  and the secondary nuclear radiation emitted by different elements when irradiated
  with thorium C and radon sources. They found that radiation with a quantum energy
  of around two million volts can undergo a new type of atomic interaction, transforming
  a considerable part of the energy into a radiation resembling -radiation with half
  a million volts quantum energy. This phenomenon is not yet fully understood and
  may involve a different type of interaction than those manifested by the extranuclear
  electronic system.
