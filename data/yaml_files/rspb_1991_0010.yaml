tldr: The author's study on sexual ornament size and fluctuating asymmetry in the
  swallow's tail found that long-tailed males with less asymmetry had better flight
  performance. Female swallows may use fluctuating asymmetry in male ornaments as
  a reliable cue for male quality. The cost of fluctuating asymmetry in tail size
  affects maneuverability during flight, suggesting that asymmetry and inherent differences
  between individuals impact flight performance.
