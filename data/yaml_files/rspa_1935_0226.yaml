tldr: This article presents a method for determining lead concentrations in cerebrospinal
  fluid using spectrographic analysis. The technique is based on exciting atoms in
  a sample with a direct current spark and measuring the intensity of a lead line,
  which is proportional to the lead concentration. The method is sensitive, accurate,
  and suitable for small sample sizes, making it useful for analyzing substances obtainable
  in limited quantities.
