tldr: Researchers studied the magnetosomes, or magnetic crystals, in a cultured coccoid
  magnetotactic bacterium. They found that the magnetosome morphology and crystal
  growth were influenced by the culture medium. The bacteria grown in an acetate-containing
  medium had more crystals and less truncation than those grown in a sulphide-containing
  medium. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties and crystal growth
  of magnetotactic bacteria.
