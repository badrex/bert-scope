revised_title: Thermal Properties of Potassium, Rubidium, and Caesium
scientific_discipline: Physics > Thermodynamics
semantic_tags:
- Alkali metals
- Specific heat
- Thermal properties
- Thermal expansion
- Compressibility
tldr: The authors measured the specific heats of potassium, rubidium, and caesium
  in the temperature range of 20 to 320°C. They found that previously reported specific
  heat anomalies in the range of 100 to 320°C were not confirmed. The results provide
  insights into the thermal properties and potential applications of these alkali
  metals.
