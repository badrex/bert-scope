tldr: The author conducted experiments to examine the laws of electro-magnetism and
  magneto-electricity. They found that previous assumptions about the conducting power
  of wires were incorrect and that the conducting power is influenced by multiple
  factors, including the diameter, length, size of the battery, and strength of the
  acid. The author also investigated the lifting powers of electro-magnets and discovered
  that the attraction is not solely dependent on the length of the magnetic circuit.
