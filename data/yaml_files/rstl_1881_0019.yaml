tldr: The authors, George J. Romanes and J. Cossar Ewart, conducted a detailed study
  on the locomotor system of echinodermata, specifically Holothuria communis. They
  observed the polian vesicle, circular canal, and tentacle sinuses, and analyzed
  their functions in the locomotion and respiration of the organism. They also examined
  the radial canals, pedicels, and ampullae, and their roles in the circulatory system
  of the echinodermata.
