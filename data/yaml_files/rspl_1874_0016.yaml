tldr: The author discusses the impact of seasonal temperature changes on ocean water,
  specifically how the changing seasons affect the temperature and density of surface
  and subsurface water. The author explains that during summer, surface water gets
  warmer and becomes lighter, while during winter, the colder surface water sinks
  and mixes with the warmer water below, distributing heat to greater depths. This
  process is influenced by the yearly range of atmospheric temperature at the surface.
