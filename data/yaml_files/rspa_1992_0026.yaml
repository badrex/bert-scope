tldr: The authors investigate the effects of suction on the nonlinear stability of
  the three-dimensional boundary layer above a rotating disc. They find that suction
  stabilizes the flow, while blowing destabilizes it. This study helps in understanding
  the role of suction in practical flows and its potential to delay the onset of transition.
