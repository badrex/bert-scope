tldr: This article discusses the discovery and history of cytokinins, their distribution
  in plants, and their biosynthesis and metabolism. Cytokinins are compounds that
  promote cell division in plants, and they have been identified in various plant
  sources. The article also highlights the challenges in isolating and identifying
  these compounds due to their low levels in plants. The presence of cytokinins in
  transfer RNA (tRNA) is also discussed, but its significance remains unclear.
