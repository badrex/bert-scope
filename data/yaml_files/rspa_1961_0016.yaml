tldr: This study investigates the thermal decomposition of ethane and how it is inhibited
  by nitric oxide. The authors found that nitric oxide reacts with ethane to form
  ethyl nitrite, which then decomposes into ethylene and nitric oxide. This process
  slows down the overall decomposition of ethane.
