tldr: The authors conducted a study on helium ratios in rocks and minerals from the
  diamond pipes of South Africa to determine their age and origin. They found that
  the eclogite and peridotite inclusions may have formed from the parent magma of
  kimberlite or be pre-existing crustal rocks. The low helium ratios in some inclusions
  make it difficult to determine their age without additional geological evidence.
