tldr: 'The authors developed a fundamental kinetic model to predict soot formation
  rates from gaseous hydrocarbons. The model considers five main processes: gas-phase
  reactions, nucleation, coagulation, growth, and oxidation. The authors applied the
  model to a practical rocket engine and found that their predictions agreed with
  experimental results. This new approach can be used to identify rate-controlling
  processes and key intermediate species in soot formation.'
