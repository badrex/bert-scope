tldr: This article discusses the role of mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs)
  in regulating AP-1 activity, a collection of dimeric transcriptional activators
  composed of Jun and Fos subunits. The specific roles of ERK, JNK, and FRK in modulating
  the level and activity of AP-1 are explored, highlighting the importance of understanding
  the regulation of AP-1 activity in cellular signaling and gene expression.
