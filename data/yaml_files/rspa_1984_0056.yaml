tldr: The author analyzes the orbit of the satellite Cosmos 482 during its last 15
  days to study the atmospheric rotation rate and density variations near perigee.
  The study provides two values for the atmospheric rotation rate at heights near
  200 km and reveals weak meridional winds. The research also determines density scale
  heights at heights of 180-220 km and suggests that the COSPAR International Reference
  Atmosphere underestimates scale heights during high solar activity levels.
