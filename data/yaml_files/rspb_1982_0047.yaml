tldr: The authors raised antisera against the presynaptic neurotoxin P-bungarotoxin
  and its phospholipase inactive derivative. They examined the cross-reactivity of
  the antisera with other phospholipase A2 enzymes and polypeptide neurotoxins. The
  antisera inhibited both the neurotoxic effects of P-bungarotoxin at the frog motor
  endplate and the enzymatic activity of the toxin on model phospholipid membranes.
  This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of P-bungarotoxin's neuromuscular
  action and the role of enzyme activity in this action.
