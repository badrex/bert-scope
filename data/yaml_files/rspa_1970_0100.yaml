tldr: The authors studied the oxidation of propyne and butyne-2, finding that the
  reactions are degenerately branched chain reactions with mechanisms similar to acetylene
  oxidation. They identified various products, including carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide,
  water, and alcohols, and analyzed the reactions using mass spectrometry. The results
  provide insights into the oxidation mechanisms of alkynes.
