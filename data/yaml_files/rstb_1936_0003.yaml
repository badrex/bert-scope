tldr: The authors studied the reproductive processes of the Bank Vole, a common and
  widespread British mammal. They observed the oestrous cycle and found that the breeding
  season lasts from April to October, with a peak in June. The study provides valuable
  information on the reproductive habits of this species and contributes to understanding
  the impact of reproduction on the population dynamics of the Bank Vole.
