tldr: The author examines the value of different geological ages and formations, focusing
  on the deposition of formations such as the Old Red Sandstone, Permian, and New
  Red series. They argue that these formations were deposited in inland lakes and
  that a continental age prevailed over much of Europe during this time. The author
  also compares the time occupied in the deposition of these formations to the time
  occupied in the deposition of the Cambrian and Silurian rocks.
