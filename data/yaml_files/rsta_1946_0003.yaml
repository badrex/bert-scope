tldr: This article presents systematic constructional tables for thin cemented aplanatic
  lenses made of two refracting media. The tables provide information for designing
  lenses with magnification and an object at infinity. They also help in selecting
  glasses for better optical instruments and improving chromatic correction. The tables
  cover a wide range of refractive indices, making them useful for various applications
  in physics and optics.
