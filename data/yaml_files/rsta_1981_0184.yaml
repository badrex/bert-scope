tldr: This article presents laboratory experiments on circulation and fronts in continental
  shelf seas. The authors use a rotating fluid layer with a lateral temperature gradient
  to model lateral density gradients in shallow seas. They observe the formation of
  gyres, fronts, and density currents, and discuss their implications for real ocean
  conditions, particularly in polar regions and near river mouths.
