tldr: The author investigates the structure of the lumbo-sacral-coccygeal cord of
  the Macaque monkey using histology techniques and provides measurements of the cross-sections
  of the cord. The study focuses on the areas of the grey and white substance at different
  levels of the cord and compares the results with previous research on human spinal
  cords. The findings contribute to the understanding of the monkey's spinal cord
  structure and its potential implications for human spinal cord research.
