tldr: The author, Tiberius Cavallo, conducted experiments to study the magnetism of
  brass and platina. He discovered that most brass and platina samples were affected
  by a magnet, even when they appeared non-magnetic in previous tests. The author
  also described the process of purifying quicksilver for experiments and shared methods
  for accurately measuring magnetic attraction. These findings contribute to a better
  understanding of magnetism and its applications.
