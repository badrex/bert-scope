tldr: The authors investigate the spectra of various flames in the infra-red region,
  focusing on the oxy-hydrogen flame. They discover that the flame emits strong infra-red
  light and find that the bands observed in the flame are due to the vibration-rotation
  spectrum of water molecules. This research contributes to the understanding of combustion
  processes and molecular spectroscopy.
