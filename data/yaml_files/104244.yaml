tldr: The author, John Ellicott, conducted experiments with two pendulum clocks designed
  for time regulation. He observed that the clocks influenced each other, causing
  one clock to stop and the other to have inconsistent performance. Ellicott did not
  offer an explanation for the phenomenon but planned to conduct further research.
