tldr: The authors analyzed the oxygen to iron ratio in oxychlorocruorin, a respiratory
  pigment found in Spirographis, and determined that one molecule of labile oxygen
  corresponds to one atom of iron. They also calculated the total amount of oxygen
  that can be carried by the chlorocruorin in Spirographis blood, which is 6.0 cmÂ³
  per gram of worm.
