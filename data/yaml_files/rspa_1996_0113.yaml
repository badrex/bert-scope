tldr: The article explores cyclic differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) and its
  application in studying the melting and solidification of pure metals. The authors
  describe the behavior of a specimen under various thermal conditions and present
  equations to predict the cyclic DSC signal. The study demonstrates how cyclic DSC
  can be used to analyze the melting and solidification kinetics of pure metals, providing
  valuable insights into materials science and thermodynamics.
