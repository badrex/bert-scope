tldr: The authors conducted experiments on monkeys to study the effects of lesions
  in different regions of the cerebral hemispheres. They found that removing the left
  occipital lobe did not affect vision, while damaging the prefrontal regions led
  to changes in behavior and mental state. These findings contributed to the understanding
  of the brain's structure and function.
