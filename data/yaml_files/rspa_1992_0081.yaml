tldr: The author analyzes the structure of molten and glassy 2:1 binary systems using
  the Bhatia-Thornton formalism. They focus on the first sharp diffraction peak, which
  is a signature of directional bonding and intermediate-range order. The study reveals
  differences in the structures of molten and glassy systems, with the former having
  a more pronounced first sharp diffraction peak, indicating a higher degree of covalent
  character and directional bonding.
