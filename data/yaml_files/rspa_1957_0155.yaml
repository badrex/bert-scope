tldr: The authors conducted a study on the coherent scattering of beta-rays by K electrons
  in heavy atoms. They used a formalism to calculate the scattering amplitudes and
  found that the amplitude for no polarization change is much smaller than predicted
  by the form-factor approximation. This led to a more accurate calculation of the
  cross-section and made it more difficult to attribute the difference between theoretical
  and experimental scattering to Delbruck scattering.
