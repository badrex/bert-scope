tldr: The authors investigate the sterol composition and biosynthesis in echinoderms,
  a group of marine invertebrates. They find that echinoderms contain complex mixtures
  of C27, C28, and C29 sterols, which can be used to classify them into different
  groups based on their sterol types. The authors also discuss the possible origin
  of these sterols, suggesting that they may be derived from the diet and that some
  species can modify them to fit their specific needs. This research contributes to
  our understanding of the biochemical and phylogenetic relationships within the phylum
  Echinodermata.
