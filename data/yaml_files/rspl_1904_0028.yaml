tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to study the effects of Indian
  cobra venom on the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. They found that the venom
  directly affects blood vessels, causing constriction and increasing arterial blood
  pressure. The venom also has a direct action on the heart, both through its muscular
  tissue and the intracardiac vagal mechanism. The study highlights the importance
  of understanding the effects of cobra venom for potential treatments and prevention
  of cobra poisoning.
