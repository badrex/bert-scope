tldr: The authors conducted cross-breeding experiments with two races of the moth
  Acidalia virgularia. They observed Mendelian segregation in the offspring and found
  that the species showed nearly complete segregation, making it valuable for future
  Mendelian research. The study provides insights into the inheritance patterns and
  hybridization of these moth races.
