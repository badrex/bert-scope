tldr: This study investigates the relationship between arterial elasticity and blood
  pressure in humans. The researchers found that as blood pressure increases, the
  extensibility of arteries decreases. This is important because more extensible arteries
  require less work from the heart and provide a more regular blood flow in the capillaries.
  The study also presents a method to measure arterial extensibility at various internal
  pressures up to the diastolic pressure.
