tldr: This study examines the coevolution between male ejaculates and female reproductive
  biology in eutherian mammals, focusing on the influence of sperm numbers and size.
  The authors argue that sperm competition has driven the evolution of high sperm
  numbers and long spermatozoa, but other factors, such as female reproductive traits,
  may also play a role. They find that sperm fertile lifespan is related to the interval
  between the onset of oestrus and ovulation, and that the duration of capacitation
  is related to sperm fertile lifespan. The study suggests that female reproductive
  traits, such as oviduct length, may influence the evolution of sperm numbers and
  size.
