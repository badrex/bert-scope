tldr: This article discusses the use of fast neutral atom beams to heat toroidally
  confined plasmas in fusion experiments. It explores the conditions for beam power
  and energy requirements, limitations of the beams, and the interactions between
  the beams and the plasma. The article also describes the creation of a beam-driven
  current, which may enable the development of continuously operated tokamak reactors.
