tldr: The author examines the crystal structures and properties of various parasulphonic
  derivatives of chloro-, bromo-, iodo-, and cyanobenzene. They describe the methods
  used to prepare these compounds and provide detailed measurements and calculations
  of their crystal angles and forms. This research contrasts para-mono-derivatives
  of benzenesulphonic acid with di-derivatives studied by Colgate and Rod.
