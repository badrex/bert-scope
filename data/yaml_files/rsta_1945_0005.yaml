tldr: The authors present a technique based on relaxation methods to solve four examples
  of large transverse displacements of thin elastic plates. They discuss the modified
  equations for large deflections and provide a detailed analysis of a circular plate
  with clamped edges under uniform transverse pressure. The study demonstrates the
  application of relaxation methods to solve complex engineering problems involving
  large deflections.
