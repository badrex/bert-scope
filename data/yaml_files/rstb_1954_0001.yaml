tldr: This study investigates the biometric differences between Micraster coranguinum
  and M. (Isomicraster) senonensis, two species of echinoids, using a sample of 516
  fossil specimens. The research focuses on the effects of allometric growth and the
  relationships between various characters in the species. The findings provide insights
  into the evolution and systematics of the genus Micraster and the impact of ecological
  niches on the development of these species.
