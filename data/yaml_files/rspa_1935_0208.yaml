tldr: The authors discuss the creation of electron pairs by fast charged particles,
  focusing on the process of pair creation due to the interaction of the particles
  with the electron of the created pair. They present a method to calculate the probability
  of this transition and the effective cross-section for pair creation, considering
  the effect of screening and the dependence on impact parameter. This work contributes
  to the understanding of particle interactions and the development of particle accelerators.
