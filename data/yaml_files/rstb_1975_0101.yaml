tldr: This study examines the petrography and sedimentology of terrestrial sediments
  on Aldabra, a raised atoll in the Western Indian Ocean. The research identifies
  seven textural groups in the sediments, which provide evidence of various depositional
  environments and help in understanding the history of Aldabra. The findings contribute
  to the understanding of sea-level fluctuations and changes in depositional environments
  in the area.
