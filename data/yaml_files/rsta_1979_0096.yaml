tldr: The article examines the structure of simple organic liquids, focusing on non-associated
  molecular liquids, and explores recent experimental results in X-ray, neutron, and
  light scattering. The authors discuss the role of size and shape in determining
  the structure of dense liquids and present molecular models to understand the liquid
  state. They conclude that the structure of unassociated molecular liquids is largely
  determined by the size and shape of the molecules.
