tldr: The author received a letter from Signor Paderni, who shared recent discoveries
  at Herculaneum and Portici, including a well-preserved brass bust of an unknown
  philosopher, a marble statue of an orator, and a brass bust of a youth. The letter
  also mentioned that workmen were about to enter a nobleman's house with rich mosaic
  pavements, hoping it would be a valuable new archaeological site.
