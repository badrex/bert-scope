tldr: The authors study the distribution of stress and velocity in glaciers and ice-sheets
  using a general flow law for ice. They develop a theoretical model that considers
  various types of flow, including laminar, extending, and compressive flow. The model
  allows for possible variations in density, temperature, and flow law with depth.
  The authors compare their theoretical results with experimental data from a borehole
  experiment on the Jungfraufirn glacier, providing insights into the behavior of
  ice masses and the effect of glacier sides on their motion.
