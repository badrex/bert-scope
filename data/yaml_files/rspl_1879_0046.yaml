tldr: The author analyzes the lines visible in solar disturbances and spots, comparing
  them to the lines observed in solar prominences. They discover that 18 lines, called
  "basic lines," are always widened in solar spots and prominences. This finding suggests
  that the sun's reversing layer contains a mix of vapors with a predominant base,
  and it adds importance to the study of spot and storm phenomena.
