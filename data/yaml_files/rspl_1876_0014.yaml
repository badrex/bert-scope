tldr: The authors studied the polarization of light by crystals of iodine and discovered
  that the reflected light from the surface of iodine films is polarized. They also
  found that the transmitted light through thin iodine films is polarized, with the
  plane of polarization being perpendicular to the plane of the light that is polarized
  by reflection from the same portion of the film. The authors observed two forms
  of iodine, depending on the arrangement of the crystals, and discussed the differences
  in their optical properties.
