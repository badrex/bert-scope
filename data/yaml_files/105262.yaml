tldr: In October 1755, an extraordinary shower of black dust fell in the Island of
  Zetland. Sir Andrew Mitchell, in his letter to John Pringle, described the event
  and its aftermath. The dust resembled lampblack and smelled of sulfur. It covered
  the country, blackening people's faces, hands, and linen. Some attributed the cause
  to an eruption of Hecla, a volcano. However, the southwest wind direction and lack
  of dust observation in Zetland at its first travel to the southward did not support
  this theory. The event was otherwise uneventful, with no significant disasters or
  damages reported.
