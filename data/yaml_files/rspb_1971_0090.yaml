tldr: This article discusses the optimal conditions for photosynthesis in a wholly
  artificial environment, comparing natural and artificial sources of light. It explores
  the energy and area requirements for sustaining a man in an extra-terrestrial environment,
  such as the Moon, and the challenges of using artificial light sources. The study
  concludes that natural light is more efficient than artificial light sources, and
  unconventional methods of illumination are not yet viable.
