tldr: This article explores the role of memory in ecological systems using a cellular
  automaton model of a middle European beech forest mosaic. It demonstrates the importance
  of memory in the evolution of local and global pattern formation and introduces
  techniques to characterize the dynamics and patterns generated by cellular automata
  and coupled map lattice models. The study also highlights the concept of transience
  in ecological systems and its impact on spatial structure and behavior.
