tldr: This article discusses the discovery and properties of F-particles and heavy
  mesons, focusing on their nature, interactions, and the challenges they posed to
  Yukawa's theory of nuclear forces. The article highlights the distinction between
  F-particles and heavy mesons, such as the /- and 77-mesons, and their respective
  interactions with nucleons and the environment.
