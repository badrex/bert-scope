tldr: This study compares the dehydrogenation rates of various alcohols using a copper
  catalyst. The authors found that the activity of the catalyst decreases with higher
  alcohols due to surface poisoning. They also discovered that the temperature coefficient
  of the reaction velocity is the same for all primary alcohols, while secondary alcohols
  have a slightly higher reaction rate and temperature efficiency.
