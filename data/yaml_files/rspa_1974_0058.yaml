tldr: This article discusses the scattering of sound waves by irregular surfaces,
  focusing on near-grazing angles of incidence. The author proposes a theory of multiple
  surface scattering, which takes into account the effects of multiple interactions
  of scattered waves with surface irregularities. The theory is valid for small surface
  roughness and provides a more accurate description of the scattering processes compared
  to single scattering and Kirchoff diffraction theory.
