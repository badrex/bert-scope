tldr: This article discusses the atmospheric reactions of amines and benzo(a)pyrene,
  focusing on their implications for health and environmental effects. The authors
  study the formation of directly mutagenic nitroderivatives when exposed to amines
  and benzo(a)pyrene, which may contribute to the carcinogenicity observed in organic
  particulates collected from smog and vehicle exhausts. They also investigate the
  reactions of nitrosamine precursors, such as secondary and tertiary methyl and ethylamines,
  with nitrous acid in the atmosphere. The environmental and health implications of
  these reactions are discussed, highlighting the complexity of the mixtures of gaseous
  and particulate pollutants that impact urban areas.
