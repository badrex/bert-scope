tldr: The author, John Davy, conducted experiments to determine if sunlight could
  convert lithic acid into oxalic acid. He found that when urine from a white-headed
  Sea-Eagle was exposed to sunlight, the lithic acid transformed into oxalate of ammonia,
  resembling the composition of guano. This discovery suggests that sunlight plays
  a role in the formation of guano and the absence of lithic acid in it.
