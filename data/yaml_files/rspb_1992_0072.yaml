tldr: The authors selected and analyzed cadmium-tolerant lines of the cyanobacteria
  Synechococcus PCC 6301 to investigate the role of metallothionein gene amplification
  and rearrangement in their tolerance to high cadmium concentrations. They found
  that the smtA gene, responsible for producing metallothionein proteins, was amplified
  and rearranged in the tolerant lines, suggesting that this process contributes to
  the development of cadmium tolerance in these organisms.
