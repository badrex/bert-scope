tldr: This study by Beevor and Horsley examines the motor region of the cortex cerebri
  in the monkey (Macacus sinicus) through electric stimulation. They focus on the
  facial area and discover precise localization for movements of individual facial
  parts, even half of the lower lip. They also discuss the specialization of tongue
  movements and some degree of unilaterality in soft palate and pharynx movements.
