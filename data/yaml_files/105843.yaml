tldr: Lieutenant Jardine and Astronomer Nevil Maskelyne observed the transit of Venus
  and other astronomical events at Gibraltar in 1769. They used a Hadley's quadrant
  and a clock to record their observations, which helped determine the latitude and
  longitude of the location. Their findings contributed to the understanding of the
  solar system and navigation.
