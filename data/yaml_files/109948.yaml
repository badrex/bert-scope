tldr: Sir Robert Seppings proposed a new method for constructing ships in the Mercantile
  Navy, which involved using shorter lengths of timber, less curvature, and connecting
  them with dowels instead of wedge pieces. This new method provided better support
  and strength in case of grounding and allowed the use of smaller timber for larger
  ships, making them more economical and efficient.
