tldr: The author conducted a long-term study on the effects of vegetation, animal
  life, and season on the composition of carbonate-of-lime waters in an aquarium.
  They found that the presence of plants and the absorption of sunlight help to reduce
  the hardness of the water by breaking down carbonic acid produced by fish. The study
  also showed that during winter months, when plant activity is lower, the water becomes
  more acidic and harder due to increased carbonic acid production by fish.
