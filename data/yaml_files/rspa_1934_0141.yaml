tldr: This study investigates the influence of pressure on the spontaneous ignition
  of inflammable gas-air mixtures, specifically hexane and isobutane-air mixtures.
  The authors found that ignition points for these mixtures lie in two distinct temperature
  ranges, with the lower range favored by high pressure and the higher range by low
  pressure. The results support the view that the lower group of ignition points is
  due to the survival and rapid oxidation of intermediate bodies, while the higher
  group results from ignitions of products of their thermal decompositions. The addition
  of 0.05% lead tetraethyl raises ignition points in a limited pressure range just
  above the critical transition pressures.
