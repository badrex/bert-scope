tldr: The author investigates the fine structure of the 4686 Ã… line of singly ionized
  helium using a liquid-hydrogen-cooled discharge tube and two Fabry-Perot etalons
  in series. They resolve and measure eight components and find that some energy levels
  are displaced from the positions predicted by the Dirac theory. These displacements
  are in good agreement with the predictions of the new theory of quantum electrodynamics.
