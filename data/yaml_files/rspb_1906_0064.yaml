tldr: The authors conducted experiments to understand the source of the "precipitable"
  substance in precipitin reactions. They discovered that the antiserum plays a significant
  role in the formation of the precipitate, rather than the test proteid. This finding
  offers a more consistent explanation of the phenomena and anomalies in precipitin
  reactions.
