tldr: The authors studied the anatomy and physiology of the cerci and abdominal giant
  fibres in house crickets, Acheta domesticus. They found that the cerci contain approximately
  3400 hair and campaniform sensilla, which form functional connections with a group
  of ten giant interneurons in the terminal abdominal ganglion. These interneurons
  respond to sound, air puff stimulation, and substrate vibration, showing a marked
  directional sensitivity to sound. The study provides insights into the precision
  of synapse formation in crickets with experimentally manipulated cercal development.
