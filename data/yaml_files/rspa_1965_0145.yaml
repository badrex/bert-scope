tldr: The authors explore the covariant extension of SU(6) and discuss the implications
  of parity conservation in particle physics. They find that parity doubling occurs
  for mesons but not baryons, and suggest using the Bargmann-Wigner equations to avoid
  indefinite metric. The study also derives five different Yukawa interactions invariant
  with respect to SU(6).
