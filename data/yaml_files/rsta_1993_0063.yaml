tldr: This study investigates the importance of bottom sediments in the North Sea
  for organic matter degradation and nutrient cycling. The research found that sediments
  act as significant sources of nutrients transferred to the water column, making
  them important sites for organic matter degradation and nutrient recycling. The
  study also examined the distribution and depositional history of radionuclides in
  North Sea sediments.
