tldr: The authors studied the ignition and flame reactions of ethylene oxide, focusing
  on cool flames and inflammability. They discovered that cool flames can be initiated
  in ethylene oxide-air mixtures at and below atmospheric pressure. The presence of
  diluents, such as acetaldehyde, lowers the minimum pressure for cool-flame initiation.
  The research also revealed that ethylene oxide can propagate a decomposition flame
  and is inflammable in admixture with air for all percentages above.
