tldr: The authors investigated the formation of ripple-mark in sand and discovered
  that it is caused by spiral vortices in the water. They found that these vortices
  start a new furrow and ridge, which leads to the creation of more ripples. The authors
  also suggested that similar processes might be responsible for the formation of
  tidal ridges, sand dunes, and cloud patterns in the sky.
