tldr: This article discusses the meteorological factors influencing the dispersion
  and deposition of pollutants, focusing on anthropogenic sulphur and nitrogen compounds.
  It examines the challenges of modeling deposition and the role of atmospheric chemistry
  in the oxidation of these compounds. The authors also present the complexity of
  factors determining the acidity of rain and its ecological effects on various regions
  in Europe.
