tldr: The author examines the formation of fossil shells and stones, arguing that
  they were once real coverings of enclosed marine life. He suggests that these shells
  and stones were formed through a flood that carried various marine life and materials
  to different locations, where they were eventually fossilized. The author provides
  evidence from various sources, including the jawbones of fish and the shells found
  in Malta, to support his claims.
