tldr: This article examines the dynamics of spinning detonation waves, focusing on
  the fluid motion of chemically reacting gases and the role of acoustic waves in
  the process. The author explores the instability of reacting gases with respect
  to wave motion and the development of transverse shocks from large amplitude acoustic
  waves in the reaction zone. The findings provide an explanation for the transverse
  acoustic waves and the spin phenomenon in detonation waves.
