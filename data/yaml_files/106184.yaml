tldr: Joseph Black conducted experiments to determine the effect of boiling on water's
  freezing point. He found that boiled water freezes more quickly than unboiled water
  due to the disturbance caused by boiling, which prevents the water from remaining
  undisturbed and cooling below the freezing point. This discovery explains why boiling
  water is used in India to make ice.
