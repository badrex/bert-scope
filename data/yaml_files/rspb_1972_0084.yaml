tldr: This study investigates the flow behavior of individual erythrocytes and rouleaux
  in dilute suspensions under steady viscous flow through circular tubes. The research
  focuses on the translation, rotation, and deformation of red blood cells and rouleaux
  in plasma, revealing that deformation occurs over a wide range of shear rates due
  to the flexibility of the particles. The findings contribute to the understanding
  of blood flow mechanics and the overall mechanics of flow in blood vessels.
