tldr: The authors investigated the growth of long-chain fatty acid crystals, specifically
  palmitic acid, and discovered two polymorphic forms. They used X-ray diffraction
  and interferometric techniques to study the crystal's structure and found that these
  crystals exhibit polytypism, which has not been observed through X-ray diffraction
  experiments before. This research provides insights into the complex structures
  and growth mechanisms of long-chain organic molecular crystals.
