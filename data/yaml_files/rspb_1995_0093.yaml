tldr: This article presents a model of sympatric speciation through sexual selection
  in small populations. The model suggests that a single mutation in a female mate-preference
  rule can lead to the rapid evolution of fully reproductively isolated species, even
  in the absence of disruptive natural selection or linkage between male traits and
  female preferences. The study also demonstrates the potential role of sexual selection
  in contributing to differences in speciation rates among lineages.
