tldr: The author studied the variation in shell patterns of marine snails from the
  genus Umbonium and found that most snails have basic patterns that merge into each
  other, creating a situation called pseudo-polymorphism. This occurs due to a single
  genotype being influenced by environmental factors and a polygenic genetic background.
  The author analyzed 11 populations from India and Ceylon, providing detailed descriptions
  and illustrations of the various patterns and colors found in these snails.
