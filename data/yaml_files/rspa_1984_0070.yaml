tldr: The authors studied the magnetic and optical properties of thulium arsenate
  (TmAsO4) using optical absorption spectroscopy and nuclear magnetic resonance. They
  found that the ground doublet of the Tm3+ ion is split by a cooperative Jahn-Teller
  distortion, which produces domains with principal axes along the crystallographic
  directions [110]. The behavior of the three lowest energy levels was studied with
  magnetic fields up to 9 T, confirming that the Jahn-Teller splitting follows mean
  field theory. However, disagreements between optical and nuclear magnetic resonance
  measurements and crystal field parameters suggest the presence of other interactions.
