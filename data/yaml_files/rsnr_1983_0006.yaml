tldr: This article corrects an error in the line denoting the variation of the absolute
  viscosity of mercury with temperature. The correct line should join the points o
  ', 16-8 millipoise 40 ', and 14-5 millipoise. The first phrase should be ignored,
  although it is true for the kinematic viscosity of mercury.
