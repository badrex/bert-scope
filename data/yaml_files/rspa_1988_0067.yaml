tldr: The authors present a new numerical method for solving the space-charge equations
  in a one-connected geometry, overcoming difficulties with previous methods. The
  method uses a hodograph transformation and an orthogonal mesh aligned parallel to
  equipotentials, resulting in automatic mesh refinement where the electric field
  is greatest. This approach reduces problems to a rectangular region in space and
  allows flexibility in choosing boundary conditions.
