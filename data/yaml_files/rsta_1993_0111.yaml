tldr: The article discusses the development of in-situ characterization and control
  techniques for compound semiconductor interfaces. The process characterization technique
  is based on photoluminescence, which determines the surface state density distribution
  on processed 'free' surfaces of semiconductors. The interface control technique
  uses an ultrathin Si interface control layer and has been applied to insulator-semiconductor,
  metal-semiconductor, and semiconductor-semiconductor interfaces. These techniques
  are essential for achieving atomic-scale perfection of interfaces in nano-electronics.
