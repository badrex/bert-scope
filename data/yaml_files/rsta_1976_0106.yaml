tldr: This article discusses the design and requirements of gas turbines, focusing
  on the versatility of the gas turbine and the variations that can be introduced
  into the simple cycle to enhance its performance for specific applications. The
  importance of pressure ratio and turbine entry temperature is emphasized, as well
  as the design features of the main components, such as compressors and turbines.
  The article also highlights the potential of closed-cycle gas turbines for nuclear
  power plants.
