tldr: This study investigates the amount of hydrogen and oxygen present on the surface
  of a metallic electrode. The researchers found that the quantity of hydrogen and
  oxygen on the surface is independent of the nature of the underlying metal and depends
  only on the accessible surface area. They also discovered that the rate of loss
  from the surface is a function of time, and the total quantity of electricity needed
  to change the electrode potential from hydrogen to oxygen or vice versa reaches
  a limiting minimum value when the current density is high.
