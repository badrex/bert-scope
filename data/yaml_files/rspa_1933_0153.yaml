tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the absorption spectra of burning
  hydrocarbons using ultra-violet light. They discovered that during combustion, aldehydes,
  acids, and unsaturated hydrocarbons absorb light differently, providing insights
  into the chemical reactions occurring during combustion. The findings contribute
  to a better understanding of the processes involved in the combustion of hydrocarbons.
