tldr: This article presents a thermodynamical theory that connects the tensile strength
  of isotropic bodies with their melting energy and Poisson's elastic constant. The
  theory is based on the conservation of energy and the idea that breaking is similar
  to melting enforced by external forces. The resulting formula for tensile strength
  is in good agreement with experimental results.
