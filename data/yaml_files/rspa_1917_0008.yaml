tldr: The author investigates the vibrations and wave behavior in an elastic plate,
  providing a comprehensive view of the various modes of vibration and their corresponding
  wave velocities. The study covers both symmetrical and anti-symmetrical vibrations,
  with a focus on the more important modes and their characteristics. The findings
  contribute to the understanding of elastic theory and have implications for seismology
  and engineering applications.
