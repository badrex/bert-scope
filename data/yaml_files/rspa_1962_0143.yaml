tldr: This article presents a large-deflexion analysis of a thin circular lenticular
  plate with a linear temperature gradient through its thickness. The study covers
  bending, buckling, and curling behaviors of the plate, providing exact solutions
  for these phenomena. The research also determines the plate's behavior when it has
  an initial spherical curvature and the possibility of snap-through buckling.
