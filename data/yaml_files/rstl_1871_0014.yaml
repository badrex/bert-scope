tldr: The author proposes a hypothesis that the differences in elevation and depression
  of the Earth's surface, such as mountains, plains, and ocean beds, have arisen from
  the Earth's mass contracting unequally as it solidified from a fluid or semi-fluid
  state. The author suggests that beneath mountains and plains, there is a deficiency
  of matter, while beneath ocean beds, there is an excess of matter. This hypothesis
  helps explain the deflection of the plumb-line in India and the varying densities
  of the Earth's crust.
