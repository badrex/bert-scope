tldr: The author uses nuclear magnetic resonance measurements to predict the nature
  of the nuclear spin arrangement in HoVO4 below 1 K. They demonstrate that a range
  of 'puckered' four sub-lattice arrangements have the same energy, and calculate
  the interactions between the ions to predict the ordered nuclear state and Neel
  temperature. The nuclear electric quadrupole interaction and exchange interaction
  are also discussed.
