tldr: The author presents a general method for producing exact rectilinear motion
  using linkwork mechanisms. They demonstrate how a property of quadrilaterals with
  constant side lengths can be used to create various 7-bar linkworks that produce
  straight-line motion. This method expands on previous work by Peaucellier, Hart,
  and the author's own previous research.
