tldr: The author presents a new formula for black body radiation that fits experimental
  data as well as Planck's formula. The formula is derived from dynamical principles
  and suggests that black body radiation is determined by the joint action of electrons
  and positive particles. The author also discusses the implications of this formula
  for atomic heat and the reconciliation of various laws in physics.
