tldr: This article studies the coupled gravitational and electromagnetic perturbations
  of Reissner-Nordström black holes, focusing on the scattering matrix, energy conversion,
  and quasi-normal modes. The research explores the behavior of these perturbations
  and their implications for understanding black hole properties and interactions.
