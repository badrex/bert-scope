tldr: The authors studied the digestive function of lysosomes in cells by observing
  the turnover of ingested foreign macromolecules. They found that lysosomes break
  down ingested macromolecules, such as albumin, into smaller components like free
  amino acids or dipeptides. This process helps protect cells from a massive penetration
  of foreign macromolecules while allowing some to enter the cell and reach their
  intended destinations.
