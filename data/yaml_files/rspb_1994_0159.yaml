tldr: This study investigates the effects of testosterone implants on the territorial
  behavior and breeding success of red grouse. The results show that implanted males
  became more aggressive, expanding their territories at the expense of unimplanted
  neighbors. This led to a decrease in population density, as some unimplanted males
  left the study area. Implanted males also had better breeding success, but poorer
  subsequent survival compared to control males. This research demonstrates the role
  of individual behavior in influencing bird population dynamics.
