tldr: 'This article reviews the progress in computer simulations of liquid crystal
  phases using hard particles, focusing on the richness of phase behavior resulting
  from molecular size and shape effects. The author discusses the role of simulations
  in testing modern theories of liquid crystal phase transitions, structure, and dynamics.
  Two specific examples are explored: the simulation of twisted nematic liquid crystals
  and the explanation of diffusive behavior in isotropic and nematic liquids using
  kinetic theory.'
