tldr: This article explores the structure and dynamics of plankton communities, focusing
  on the interactions between phytoplankton, zooplankton, and environmental factors.
  The authors discuss the importance of studying the size structure of these communities
  and how it affects their composition and interactions. They also examine the role
  of environmental factors, such as light, nutrients, and temperature, in shaping
  plankton communities and their trophic levels.
