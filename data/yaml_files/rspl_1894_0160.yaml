tldr: This article discusses the 'finger and toe' disease that affects cabbage and
  other cruciferous plants. The author, George Massee, explains that the disease is
  caused by a minute organism related to fungi, Plasmodiophora brassicae. The disease
  is influenced by the amount of lime in the soil, with low lime content promoting
  the disease. The author also shares experiments conducted at Kew, demonstrating
  the effects of different soil treatments on the development of the disease.
