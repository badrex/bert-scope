tldr: The author, Professor James Thomson, presents a new kinematic principle for
  integrating machines, specifically an integrating machine that uses pure rolling
  contact instead of a combination of rolling and slipping. This new principle offers
  improvements over previous instruments like Morin's Dynamometer and Sang's Planimeter,
  and has potential applications in tide-calculating machines and other areas of mechanical
  work measurement.
