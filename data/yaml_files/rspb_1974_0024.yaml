tldr: The study investigates the effects of haemodynamic stress on blood vessel walls
  using arteriovenous shunts in sheep. The results show that vibrations from the shunt
  induce phlebosclerosis, intimal tears, mural dissection, and thrombosis in the veins.
  The findings suggest that haemodynamic stress plays a significant role in the development
  of atherosclerosis, dissecting aneurysm, and arterial ulceration, and that an atherogenic
  diet is not necessary for the development of atherosclerosis.
