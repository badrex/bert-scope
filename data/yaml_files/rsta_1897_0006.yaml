tldr: The author conducted a series of experiments to investigate the connection between
  ether and matter. They used rotating steel plates and a light beam to study the
  effect of motion on the velocity of light. The experiments showed that there was
  no first-order effect of purely irrotational ethereal motion that could be optically
  detected, suggesting that ether is not mechanically connected to matter.
