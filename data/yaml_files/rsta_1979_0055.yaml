tldr: This article discusses the advancements in mechanized ultrasonic testing and
  its applications in engineering and medical diagnosis. It highlights the differences
  between the two fields, such as sound velocities, material density, and specific
  acoustical impedances, and explores the limitations and future prospects of the
  technology. The article also explains various techniques used in ultrasonic testing,
  such as beam-spread, sound refracting prism, and tandem techniques, and their importance
  in flaw detection and evaluation.
