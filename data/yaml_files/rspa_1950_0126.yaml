revised_title: Surface Adsorption and Flow of Gases and Vapours through Micropores
scientific_discipline: Chemistry > Physical Chemistry
semantic_tags:
- Gas flow
- Surface diffusion
- Porous media
- Molecular streaming
- Surface adsorption
tldr: The authors study the flow and diffusion of gases and vapors through micropores,
  focusing on the transition from slip flow to molecular streaming and the effects
  of surface adsorption. They analyze the behavior of various porous materials and
  propose a method for determining surface area using gas permeability tests.
