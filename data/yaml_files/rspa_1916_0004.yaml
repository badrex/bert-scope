tldr: The author presents an advanced mathematical analysis of the capillary tube
  problem, focusing on the surface tension and fluid dynamics of liquids in vertical
  tubes. They discuss various approximations and methods to determine the necessary
  tube width for accurate measurements, and provide numerical examples for better
  understanding.
