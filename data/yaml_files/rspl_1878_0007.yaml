tldr: The author conducted experiments with cobra poison, extracted from the Naja
  tripudians snake, to study its composition and properties. They found that the poison
  contains about 60% albuminous matter and 40% poisonous matter. The author also tested
  various methods to separate a crystallizable principle from the poison but was unsuccessful.
  The author concluded that ammonia, a reported remedy for snakebite, does not have
  any chemical action on the poison and may even increase its rapidity of action.
