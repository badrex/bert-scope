tldr: This article explores the interaction of an electron with a radiation field
  using Dirac's theory of quantum electrodynamics. The author solves the wave equation
  to higher approximations, enabling the consideration of various physical processes
  with greater accuracy. The study focuses on the elimination of divergent integrals
  and the interpretation of both positive and negative energy photons in the representation.
