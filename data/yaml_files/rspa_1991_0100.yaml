tldr: This article demonstrates a selection mechanism for stripes and spots in reaction-diffusion
  equations, showing that both cannot be stable at the same time. The selection is
  determined by the nonlinear terms, with stripes being selected in symmetric systems
  without quadratic terms, while spots can appear when quadratic terms are present.
  The authors provide a general algorithm for determining the selected pattern in
  arbitrary reaction-diffusion equations.
