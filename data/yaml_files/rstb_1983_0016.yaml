tldr: The authors discovered two new genera of nanoplankton, Ophiaster and Calciopappus,
  in the Galapagos Islands. These spectacular coccolithophorids have unmineralized
  periplast components, which provide new insights into their morphology and taxonomy.
  The study highlights the importance of examining extant taxa to better understand
  fossil records and improve taxonomic classification.
