tldr: Female zebra finches choose extra-pair copulations with genetically attractive
  males, as they have higher song rates, better offspring, and more attractive traits.
  This discovery provides a mechanism for sexual selection in monogamous species and
  supports the "good genes" models of sexual selection.
