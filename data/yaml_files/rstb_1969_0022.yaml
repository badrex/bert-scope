tldr: This study examines the interstitial fauna of a sandy beach in the Solomon Islands,
  focusing on the organisms found in the sand samples. The research identifies various
  genera of foraminifera and a few annelids, nematodes, and turbellarians. The beach
  has a stable topography, composed of coarse, clean, and highly oxygenated sand with
  shell and rock fragments and a large number of living micro-foraminifera.
