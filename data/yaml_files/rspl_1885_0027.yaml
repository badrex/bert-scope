tldr: The author investigates the limited hydration of ammonium carbamate and its
  reaction with water, focusing on the influence of time, mass, and temperature. The
  study shows that the action of hydration proceeds rapidly at first but becomes progressively
  slower, eventually reaching a limit. The time required to reach a specific level
  of hydration is greater for stronger solutions, indicating that hydration decreases
  as the relative number of water molecules increases. The author also explores the
  effect of temperature on the hydration process, finding that lower temperatures
  result in less hydration.
