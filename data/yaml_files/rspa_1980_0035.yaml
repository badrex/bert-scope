tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the pressure of radiation in refractive
  media using the photon drag effect in germanium and silicon. They found that at
  long wavelengths, the effect is independent of the semiconductor band structure
  and depends on the radiation pressure in the dielectric. The results support Minkowski's
  original expression for radiation momentum. This research provides additional experimental
  information on radiation pressure and contributes to the understanding of the photon
  drag effect in refractive media.
