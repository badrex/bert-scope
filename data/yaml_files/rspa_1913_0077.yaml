tldr: This article discusses spectroscopic investigations of nitrogen-containing compounds,
  specifically silicon and titanium tetrachlorides. The authors discovered new bands
  in the spectrum of silicon tetrachloride, which they attributed to a nitride of
  silicon. They also found that titanium tetrachloride did not develop any bands that
  could be attributed to a nitride, suggesting that it behaves differently than silicon
  tetrachloride in the afterglow.
