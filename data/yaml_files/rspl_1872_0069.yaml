tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the development of bacteria in organic
  infusions, such as hay and turnip, and observed the conditions necessary for their
  growth. They found that bacteria appeared in sealed flasks containing organic infusions,
  and discussed the importance of understanding the life-history and life-conditions
  of these organisms before considering the hypothesis of spontaneous generation.
