tldr: The authors conducted a comprehensive investigation of the critical values for
  the M group of elements, including chromium, manganese, iron, cobalt, nickel, copper,
  and zinc, to understand the development of inner electron groups. They used the
  critical potential method to measure the photoelectric current from metallic plates
  caused by X-radiation emitted by the elements under electronic bombardment. The
  results confirmed the view that the M group of electrons is in the process of development
  in this region of the periodic classification.
