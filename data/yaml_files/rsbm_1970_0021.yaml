tldr: George Robert Sabine Snow was a notable botanist and plant physiologist who
  made significant contributions to the understanding of plant responses to external
  stimuli, particularly geotropism. His research focused on the conduction of geotropic
  excitation in roots and the response of roots to gravity. Snow's work was characterized
  by carefully designed experiments using minimal apparatus and materials, often involving
  delicate manipulation of living plants or plant organs.
