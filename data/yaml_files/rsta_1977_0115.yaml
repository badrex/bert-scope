tldr: This article discusses the mineralogy of silica phases in deep-sea cherts and
  porcelanites, focusing on the identification of opal-CT as the main silica phase
  present in these rocks. The authors describe the occurrences, petrography, and mineralogy
  of cherts and porcelanites recovered from various ocean basins by the Deep Sea Drilling
  Project. They also discuss the formation processes and the conversion of opal-CT
  to quartz in these rocks.
