tldr: Researchers studied the physical properties of dilute plasma gels and found
  that they share similarities with the vitreous body. Diluting plasma and allowing
  it to coagulate produced a gel that resembled the vitreous body in appearance, stability,
  and ultramicroscopic structure. The elastic properties of the plasma gel were also
  investigated, revealing that it was more rigid than the vitreous body. This study
  suggests that the physical properties of the vitreous body are not unique and can
  be replicated in a dilute plasma gel.
