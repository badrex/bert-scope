tldr: This study investigates the tidal motion, currents, and energy in the Irish
  Sea. The authors apply Laplacian theory to derive results connecting tidal flow,
  free surface of the sea, and its rotation. They apply these relations to the Irish
  Sea and find a satisfactory agreement between theory and observation. The study
  also reveals a steady residual drift of water northwards and evaluates the mean
  rates of flow and energy transfer in the Irish Sea.
