tldr: This article discusses the controversy surrounding the appropriate creep law
  and mechanism for rocks deforming under the stress, temperature, and pressure conditions
  found within the Earth's mantle. The author argues that small strain, transient
  creep, rather than steady-state creep, is involved in the isostatic rebound phenomenon,
  and that power law creep is likely the creep law governing convective flow in the
  mantle.
