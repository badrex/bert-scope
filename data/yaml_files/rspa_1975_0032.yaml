tldr: The absorption spectrum of Sr I between 40 and 95 Ã… was studied, revealing new
  structure due to excitation from the 4s and 4p subshells. Window resonances were
  observed and attributed to simultaneous excitation of two electrons, one from the
  4s and one from the 4p subshell. The wave function collapse in the presence of an
  excited core was analyzed using Hartree-Fock calculations, providing insights into
  the inner shell interactions and configuration mixing.
