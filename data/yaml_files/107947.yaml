tldr: This article discusses the influence of screens in arresting the progress of
  magnetic action. The author, William Snow Harris, conducted experiments with various
  materials and found that the screening effect depends on the mass of the intervening
  substance. This discovery led him to believe that the screening influence of substances
  is more or less common to every class of substance, and that to render it sensible,
  it is only necessary to employ different bodies in masses bearing some direct ratio
  to their respective magnetic energies.
