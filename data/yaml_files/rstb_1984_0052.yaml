tldr: This article discusses the aerodynamic mechanisms involved in hovering insect
  flight, focusing on lift generation and wing kinematics. The authors explore various
  mechanisms, such as leading edge separation bubbles, rotational vorticity, and delayed
  stall, to explain how insects generate lift during hovering. They also examine the
  influence of wake vorticity on the bound vorticity of wings and the role of unsteady
  aerofoil theory in understanding these complex flight dynamics.
