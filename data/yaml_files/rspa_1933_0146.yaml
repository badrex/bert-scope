tldr: The authors present a numerical method for solving the equations of steady viscous
  flow around circular cylinders at low speeds. They use a grid transformation and
  repeated interpolation to obtain approximate solutions for the flow field, streamlines,
  and pressure distribution. This method can be applied to other equations and problems
  in fluid dynamics.
