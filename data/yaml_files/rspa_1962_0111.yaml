tldr: The authors conducted carbon-14 tracer studies on the slow combustion of 2-methyl-but-2-ene
  to investigate the formation of major and minor oxidation products. The results
  suggest that the major products, such as acetone and acetaldehyde, arise from the
  simple breakdown of a cyclic peroxide formed by adding oxygen to the olefin at the
  double bond. The minor products, like methyl ethyl ketone and isopropyl alcohol,
  are formed through different mechanisms, including hydroperoxylation and rearrangements
  of a biradical. This research provides further evidence for the modes of formation
  of the major products and helps explain the mechanisms of the minor products' formation.
