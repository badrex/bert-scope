  Coefficient'

tldr: The author investigates the delay to ignition and its temperature coefficient
  in various explosives, such as lead azide, fulminate, and barium styphnate. They
  found that the delay to ignition can be expressed by an Arrhenius equation and that
  the heat sensitiveness of explosives depends on the activation energy of the physico-chemical
  process controlling it. The author also discovered that initiators like lead azide
  can be permanently sensitized by heat treatment or photochemical action, which affects
  their ignition times.
