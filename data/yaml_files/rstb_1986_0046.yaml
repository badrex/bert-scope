tldr: The authors discovered the six-carbon intermediate, 2'-carboxy-3-keto-D-arabinitol
  1,5-bisphosphate (CKABP), in the ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase reaction. They
  studied its properties, including its stability, decarboxylation, and hydrolysis.
  CKABP undergoes decarboxylation and hydrolysis, with the latter being more prominent
  at higher pH levels. The authors also found that CKABP exists predominantly as the
  C-3 ketone in solution, while on the enzyme, it exists as the hydrated C-3 gem-diol
  form.
