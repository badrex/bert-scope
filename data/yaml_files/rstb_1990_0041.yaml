tldr: The authors investigated the dynamics of the wing beat in Drosophila melanogaster
  by calculating the forces acting on the wings using three-dimensional kinematic
  data. They found that the conventional aerodynamic theories, which assume quasi-steady
  aerodynamics, do not account for the hovering flight performance of small insects.
  The results support the notion that flight in small insects might be dominated by
  unsteady mechanisms.
