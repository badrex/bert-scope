tldr: The authors conducted experiments to determine if muscle contains a glycolytic
  enzyme responsible for the destruction of sugar during muscle contraction. They
  found that muscle does contain a glycolytic enzyme, but it is delicate and difficult
  to isolate without destroying its power. This discovery could have implications
  for understanding diabetes and muscle metabolism.
