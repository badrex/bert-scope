tldr: This paper presents a nonlinear theory of water waves for finite and infinite
  depths, using a direct approach based on the directed (or Cosserat) surfaces model.
  The authors recast the basic conservation equations in an Eulerian form and identify
  various quantities in the conservation equations through weighted averages. Applications
  to various water wave problems under gravity are discussed, including steady-state
  solutions for surface disturbances and a detailed study of nonlinear stern waves
  over infinite depths.
