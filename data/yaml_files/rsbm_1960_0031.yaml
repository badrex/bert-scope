tldr: Thomas Godfrey Mason was a plant physiologist who made significant contributions
  to the understanding of plant transport systems. He studied translocation in plants,
  focusing on sugar transport in the xylem and phloem. His work on the greater yam
  and cotton plants led to the discovery of new anatomical structures, such as glomeruli,
  which play a role in mass movement of liquids in the phloem. Mason's research on
  translocation in cotton, in collaboration with E. J. Maskell and E. Phillis, provided
  comprehensive analyses of concentrations and quantities of carbohydrates and other
  constituents, helping to establish the role of sieve tubes in transport.
