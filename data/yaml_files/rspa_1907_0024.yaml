tldr: This study investigates the effects of high gaseous pressures on electric furnace
  reactions, focusing on the formation of calcium carbide, carborundum, nitric acid,
  alumina reduction, and quartz fusion. The authors found that pressure influences
  the yield and properties of these materials, and they provide detailed descriptions
  of their experimental setup and results.
