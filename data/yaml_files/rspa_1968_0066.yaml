tldr: The authors studied the remanent magnetization of haematite single crystals
  and found that the synthetic crystals showed a sharp reduction in remanent magnetization
  over a narrow temperature range, while natural crystals exhibited a smaller reduction
  over a wider temperature range. The results challenge theoretical predictions and
  provide insights into the behavior of haematite crystals.
