tldr: Pulsars are incredibly stable clocks that can be used to study various aspects
  of physics, particularly relativistic gravity. Pulsar timing observations have confirmed
  the existence of quadrupolar gravitational waves and provided constraints on the
  nature of gravity, Newton's constant, and low-frequency gravitational waves in the
  universe. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of
  the cosmos and the fundamental forces at play.
