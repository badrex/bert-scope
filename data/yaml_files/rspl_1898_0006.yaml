tldr: The authors conducted experiments to induce temporary color-blindness in people
  and studied the effects on their color vision. They used various methods, including
  exposure to specific colors and spectroscopy, to analyze color sensations and found
  that each color sensation can be exhausted without affecting the others. The results
  support the Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision, which suggests the existence
  of three color sensations (red, green, and blue).
