tldr: The authors investigated the Raman spectra of sulphuric, nitric, and nitrosylsulphuric
  acids to determine their molecular structures. They found that nitrosylsulphuric
  acid has unique spectral features, indicating the presence of specific groups within
  the molecule. The study also revealed similarities and differences in the spectra
  of the three acids, providing insights into their molecular configurations.
