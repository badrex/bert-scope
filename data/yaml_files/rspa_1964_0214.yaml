tldr: This article reviews the mechanical strengths attainable in two-phase structures
  consisting of a ductile metal matrix with other phases distributed within it. It
  discusses various methods to introduce particles, such as precipitation at low temperatures
  from a supersaturated solid solution, eutectoid decomposition, and mechanical mixing
  and sintering of powders. The article also explores the factors affecting the strength
  of these microstructures and the potential improvements in strength that can be
  achieved.
