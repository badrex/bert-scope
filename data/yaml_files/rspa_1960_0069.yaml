tldr: The authors investigated the anisotropic thermoelectric properties of graphite
  and found that the thermoelectric power varies with the crystallographic direction.
  This study provides insights into the thermoelectric behavior of anisotropic materials
  and their potential applications in thermoelectric devices.
