tldr: The Ariel III satellite was designed to measure terrestrial radio noise from
  lightning discharges to study the distribution of sources and understand the electrical
  balance of the atmosphere. The experiment focused on three frequency ranges and
  used a circular orbit at an altitude of about 500 km to receive noise from specific
  areas. The findings provided statistical information on the distribution of radio
  noise sources and helped resolve issues related to interference in communications
  and meteorology.
