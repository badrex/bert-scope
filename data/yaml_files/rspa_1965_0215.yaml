tldr: The authors studied the kinetics and equilibrium of electron transfers between
  mono- and dinegative ions of anthracene and 1,1-diphenyl ethylene. They investigated
  the reaction between disodium anthracene and 1,1-diphenyl ethylene, which produces
  a mixed dimer that decomposes reversibly. The authors used stop-flow techniques
  to analyze the reaction and found that the equilibrium constant for the reaction
  is around 5. The study helps to understand the mechanisms of electron transfers
  and the formation of complex structures in organic chemistry.
