tldr: This article explores the creation of portrait medallions by Josiah Wedgwood,
  a prominent potter and ceramic chemist. These medallions were made using a new ceramic
  material called jasper, which allowed for affordable and durable reproductions of
  portraits. Many famous artists and modellers, such as Sir Joshua Reynolds and John
  Flaxman, designed and modeled the medallions, which were often made from original
  wax portraits. Over 70 portrait medallions of Fellows of the Royal Society were
  produced, celebrating their contributions to science and art.
