tldr: The authors calculated the electrostatic contributions to the formation energies
  of crystallographic shear planes in TiO2 by determining the energy difference due
  to the introduction of these planes into the rutile structure. They found that the
  difference sums converge rapidly, allowing for more accurate calculations of the
  energy changes associated with the formation of crystallographic shear planes. This
  study helps to better understand the energetics of these defects in materials science.
