revised_title: 'On the Diffraction of the Magnetic Electron: Wave Equations and Electromagnetic
  Fields'
scientific_discipline: Physics > Electromagnetism
semantic_tags:
- Electromagnetic Fields
- Electron Diffraction
- Wave Equations
- Magnetic Forces
- Crystal Diffraction
tldr: The author examines the electromagnetic fields of a moving electron using wave
  equations and explores the diffraction of magnetic electrons by electric and magnetic
  forces. The study focuses on the similarities between electron waves and light waves,
  and how magnetic forces can affect the polarization of electrons during diffraction.
