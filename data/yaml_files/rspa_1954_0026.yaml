tldr: The authors conducted experiments to study the production of heavy mesons by
  protons with energy greater than 2. They used photographic emulsions to measure
  the mass and scattering of secondary particles emitted from the interactions. The
  results suggest that not only heavy mesons but also other heavy quanta are associated
  with the nuclear field.
