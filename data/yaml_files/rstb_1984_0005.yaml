tldr: This article discusses the high pressure neurological syndrome (h.p.n.s.), a
  complex of behavioral changes observed in vertebrates when exposed to increasing
  pressures. The author explores the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the central
  nervous system, the mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation to high pressure, and
  the potential for genetic factors in the evolution of deep-sea animals. The article
  also examines the relationship between pressure and temperature in affecting biological
  processes and the potential for pressure acclimation in mammals.
