tldr: The author invents a new mercurial vacuum tap that allows for connecting and
  disconnecting experimental apparatus from a mercurial pump without discharging the
  vacuum. This innovation helps in handling apparatus under exhaustion more efficiently
  and effectively. The author also discusses the relationship between atmospheric
  pressure, volcanic activity, and lunar positions, suggesting tidal influences on
  the liquid magma beneath volcanoes.
