tldr: This study investigates the flow of polycrystalline metals, specifically lead,
  under simple shear conditions. The research covers a wide range of strain, stress,
  and temperature, revealing different stages of flow and the effects of stress reversal.
  The findings provide insights into the behavior of metals under stress and the role
  of crystal structure in their deformation.
