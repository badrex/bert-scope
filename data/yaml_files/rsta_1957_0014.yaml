tldr: This study investigates the origin of the palaeomagnetism in the Torridonian
  sandstones of North-West Scotland. The ferromagnetic minerals in these sandstones,
  such as specularite and magnetite, are described, and it is concluded that the evidence
  supports a depositional type of magnetization. The magnetization is likely due to
  the alignment of detrital specularite particles during deposition, rather than the
  influence of water currents or tectonic activity.
