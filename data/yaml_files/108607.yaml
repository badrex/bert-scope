tldr: Edward Sabine examines the existence of the decennial inequality in solar-diurnal
  and lunar-diurnal magnetic variations using observations from the Hobarton Observatory.
  He finds that the solar-diurnal variations exhibit a decennial period, while the
  lunar-diurnal variations do not. This study is important for understanding the theoretical
  implications of magnetic variations.
