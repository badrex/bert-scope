tldr: John Tyndall's experiments demonstrate a new series of chemical reactions produced
  by light using the concentrated beam of an electric lamp. He discovered that the
  more refrangible rays, such as blue light, are the most chemically active. This
  research sheds light on the relationship between a liquid and its vapor and raises
  questions about the mechanism of absorption and the seat of its action in molecular
  physics.
