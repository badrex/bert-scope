tldr: The authors present a method to calculate the properties of carbonate crystals,
  focusing on the calcite structure. They use a direct method to determine the most
  stable arrangement of ions in the crystal lattice, which requires only one parameter
  to fix the size and shape of the rhombohedral cell. This method provides an absolute
  measure of the crystal's stability, which is not yet determined by other methods.
