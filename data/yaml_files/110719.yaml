tldr: The author provides additional insights into embryonic development, specifically
  the formation of the chorion and the role of cells in its development. They observe
  that a layer of cells remains surrounding the "zona" after the thinner membrane
  has formed, and these cells contribute to the thickening of the chorion. The author
  also notes the presence of pellucid globules and discoid objects in the fluid space
  between the "zona" and the thinner membrane, which may play a role in cell growth
  and development.
