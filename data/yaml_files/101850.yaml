tldr: The author, Francis Lodwick, presents a proposal for an "Universal Alphabet"
  to address the difficulties in writing and pronouncing various languages accurately.
  The proposed alphabet aims to contain all single sounds or letters used in any language,
  enabling better communication and understanding across languages. The author also
  discusses the importance of standardizing and perpetuating the true sounds of languages
  for future generations.
