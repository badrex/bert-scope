Rituals are seen as responses to danger and serve to reaffirm solidarity among individuals, re-establish contact with essential principles, and provide a sense of confirmation and protection. The author argues that despite the modernization and secularization of society, rituals will continue to play a significant role in human life, as long as the need for order, meaning, and seriousness remains.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Anthropology"}
