They used a virtual bound state model and found that the spin wave spectrum has two branches, with one branch having zero frequency in the long wavelength limit. The study also provided a simple relation between the induced giant moment and the susceptibility of the matrix, which is in reasonable agreement with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
