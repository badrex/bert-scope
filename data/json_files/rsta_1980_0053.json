The authors use techniques like electron microscopy and small-angle X-ray scattering to study the structure and properties of these fibers. They find that the skin regions of type I carbon fibers contain flaws that limit the material's tensile strength, while type II and type A fibers have different structural characteristics. The study highlights the importance of oxidation in the production of carbon fibers from PAN and the role of electron microscopy in characterizing their structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fiber Composites"}
