The attractors depend on the initial population levels and immune host proportions, leading to complex and non-unique dynamics in the population. The basins of attraction, defining the initial conditions leading to certain types of attractors, are found to be fractal sets, making it difficult to predict the attractor based on an initial state.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
