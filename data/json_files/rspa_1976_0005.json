The research focuses on the characteristics of flow when the Dean number is large, and proposes an asymptotic description for the fully-developed laminar flow within a general symmetric section. The findings provide insights into the fluid dynamics of curved pipes and have implications for understanding blood flow in the human aorta and other physiological applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
