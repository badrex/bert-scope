They found that the activity of precipitants, such as alcohols and hydrogen chloride, varies depending on the type of salt and temperature. The study provides insights into the precipitation process and the role of solvent water in solution chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution chemistry"}
