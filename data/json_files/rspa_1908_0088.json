They discuss the effect of hydrostatic pressure on the osmotic membrane and propose a formula for the change of vapour-pressure of a volatile solute with hydrostatic pressure. The study also considers the osmotic membrane as a vapour-sieve, permeable to the vapour of the solution but not to the liquid phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
