They used two methods, tension and compression, to produce distortion and measured the angles and distances between crystal faces. The results showed that the distortion followed specific patterns, with the unstretched cones coinciding with two planes. This type of distortion is caused by uniform shearing or slipping parallel to these planes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
