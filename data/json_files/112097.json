The author defines a bubble as a mass of gaseous matter compelled to assume a spherical form by the cohesion and weight of the liquid medium in which it is formed. The study examines various types of bubbles, including those with a liquid film, and explores the effects of solid supports, gas tension, and other factors on bubble size.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
