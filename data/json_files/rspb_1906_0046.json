They observe a marked proliferation of neuroglia tissue, chronic inflammation, and lymphocyte infiltration in both conditions. The study provides insights into the similarities and differences between the two diseases and their effects on the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurology"}
