They develop an analytical approach to calculate the coefficient of upward scattering for any given incident light field in a medium where the volume scattering is known. This method offers a deeper insight into the nature of multiple scattering in the ocean and can be applied in the calculation of the average cosine and the transmittance of downwelling irradiance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
