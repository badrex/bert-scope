This method is suitable for semi-empirical applications and provides a better understanding of the electronic structure of conjugated systems. The localized orbitals are associated with individual atoms in the conjugated system, making them more suitable for chemical analysis and interpretation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
