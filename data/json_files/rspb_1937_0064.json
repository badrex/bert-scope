They discovered that these organs are sensitive to mechanical stimuli, such as water movement and pressure, and can detect temperature changes. The lateral line system is made up of secondary sense cells with hair-like processes that are excited by the movement of fluid in the canals. The authors propose a new hypothesis that explains the diverse responses of the lateral line system and its role in fish behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Ichthyology"}
