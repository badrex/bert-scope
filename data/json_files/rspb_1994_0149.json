The models consider reproductive compensation for the loss of lethal embryos, allowing for the spread of recessive lethals and the establishment of polymorphic equilibrium. The introduction of a second lethal mutation on a non-lethal haplotype can increase its frequency and displace non-lethal haplotypes. The theoretical predictions are compared with data on natural populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
