The theory explains the deviation between the applied field and the magnetization in both cubic and non-cubic crystals, and it is in agreement with spectroscopic data. The study of ferromagnetic crystals might help to clarify the problem of the failure of the Weiss law just above the Curie point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
