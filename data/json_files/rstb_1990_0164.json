The authors explore the physiological properties of LTP and its potential involvement in learning and memory processes. They also investigate the use of selective antagonists of excitatory amino acid receptors, such as the NMDA receptor antagonist AP5, to study the functional significance of LTP in learning and memory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
