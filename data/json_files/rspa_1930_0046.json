They discovered that new maxima appear at high temperatures, which are characteristic of the target substance itself. The research also showed that the 25-volt maximum was produced by an adsorbed layer formed on the cold target in the high vacuum. The authors used an improved apparatus to analyze the velocity distribution among scattered electrons for various angles."}
