They find that the stress tensor is not uniquely defined by the microscopic laws of conservation of momentum and angular momentum, leading to difficulties in defining statistical mechanical expressions for the surface tension of a drop. The study highlights the importance of understanding the non-uniqueness of the pressure tensor in inhomogeneous fluids and its implications for the statistical mechanical theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
