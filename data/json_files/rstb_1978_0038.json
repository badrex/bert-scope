The authors found that injected DNA is transcribed into RNA and translated into proteins in the oocyte nucleus. This process has the potential to map regulatory sequences in DNA molecules and could be used for the integration of genes into oocytes or eggs for further study in development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Gene Expression and Regulation"}
