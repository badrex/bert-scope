The researchers found that the spindle systems contain both fast and slow muscle fibers, and both 'twitch' and 'grape' end-plates are present on different intrafusal fibers. The sensory discharge of the frog spindle is controlled in part by the intrafusal muscle fibers causing deformation of the sensory endings. The muscle innervation is summarized, and the researchers provide a detailed description of the methods used in their study.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
