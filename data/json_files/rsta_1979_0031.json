It describes the main Proterozoic provinces in Australia, the types of mineral deposits, and the tectonic evolution of the continent. The author suggests that the formation of uranium deposits was an integral part of the evolution of geosynclines in the central Australian belt. The deposits are found in structurally prepared features such as shears, faults, and breccias, and the mineralizing fluids' source and deposition mechanism are still in dispute.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Mineral Deposits"}
