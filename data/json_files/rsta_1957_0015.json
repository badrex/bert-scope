The results show that these rocks possess magnetizations different from the present geomagnetic field, suggesting that the main geomagnetic field maintained a single sense during the whole of the Palaeozoic era. The study also examines the magnetization of the Old Red Sandstone and discusses the possible effects of secular variation and geological dip on the magnetization of these rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleomagnetism"}
