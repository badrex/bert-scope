The platypus has grinding teeth on each side of its upper and lower jaws and a short tongue. Its organ of smell is different from that of other animals, with two cavities along the length of its beak, which may help it detect prey in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
