They find that both consist of rows of globules held together by a gelatinous matter, but the globules in muscular fibers are larger and the gelatinous matter is less elastic, making the fibers more brittle. This study contributes to the understanding of the similarities and differences between muscles, nerves, and ganglions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
