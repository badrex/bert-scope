The rate of lactic acid accumulation is determined by the storage temperature, and it is not caused by oxygen deficiency. The research also discovers that the concentration of inorganic ions in the muscle plasma plays a significant role in the formation of lactic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
