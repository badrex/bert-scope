They discover that the color change is due to variations in hydration and the arrangement of water molecules in the crystals. This study helps explain the phenomena observed in cooling certain hydrated salts and may have implications for the study of other colored salts at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
