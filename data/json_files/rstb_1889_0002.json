The authors conducted experiments on dogs, stimulating the chorda tympani nerve and analyzing the resulting saliva samples. They found that the concentration of salts in saliva decreases as the rate of secretion increases, and that this relationship is influenced by the condition of the gland and the method of stimulation. The authors also discuss the challenges in accurately measuring the rate of secretion and the concentration of salts in saliva samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
