The author found that the electrical signs of secreto-motor action can be demonstrated in the cat's foot after death, particularly during the second half-hour. The study also shows that the difference between muscular and secreto-motor phenomena is mainly a difference in time, with the latter being about 100 times slower. The author also observed that the latent period, response duration, and voltage of the response are affected by temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
