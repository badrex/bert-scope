They discovered that the fibers in both organs are curvilinear and lemniscate, or spiral-shaped, which helps clarify previous conflicting descriptions of their structure. This research provides a more accurate understanding of the muscular anatomy of the bladder and prostate, which can aid in medical treatments and procedures.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Urology"}
