They found that the hysteresis loss is likely the same at high and low speeds, and the shape of the hysteresis loop has been determined. The hysteresis loss in a hardened steel tube is about one-eighth of that in the same tube after annealing. The loss per cubic centimeter per cycle varies approximately as the cube of the stress-range."}
