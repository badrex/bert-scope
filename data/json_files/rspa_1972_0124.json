The authors derive equations describing the characteristics of the fundamental mode and the first harmonic, and provide a solution for the case of relatively long wavelengths compared to the sheet thickness. The study explains how thinning of the sheet is caused by the growth of the harmonic wave, leading to maximum thinning and subsequent rupture at specific positions along the sheet. The authors also calculate the break-up lengths of attenuating sheets and compare the results with measured values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
