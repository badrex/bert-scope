The authors propose an alternative to Oseen's approximate equation, which they believe offers a closer approximation to the actual flow pattern. The new equation is linear and tractable, allowing for further analysis of fluid dynamics and the effects of Reynolds number on the flow pattern.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
