As blackcaps increase their fat load for migration, their take-off velocity and angle of ascent decrease, making them more vulnerable to predators. The research suggests that the large fat loads needed for migration may increase the risk of predation for blackcaps.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
