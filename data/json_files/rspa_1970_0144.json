Duality provides powerful bootstrap conditions and restrictions on the hadron spectrum. The author explains various forms of duality, including finite energy sum rules, and shows how antidual models conflict with empirical facts. The article highlights the controversy between interference models and duality, and explores the implications of duality on the understanding of elementary particle processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
