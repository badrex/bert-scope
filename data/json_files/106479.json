The disease begins to show itself around the age of 25-30 and is more common among the wealthy, polygamous families. The cause of the disease is not entirely clear, but the author suggests that it may be related to climate, food, water, hereditary disposition, or a combination of these factors. The author also notes that the French, who control the region, may have more information on this disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical History"}
