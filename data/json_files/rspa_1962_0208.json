They use a distribution of simple and dipole sources on the reflecting surface to create a field equivalent to the once-reflected field. This method is particularly useful for high-frequency sound waves and can be applied to various scenarios, such as the field near the caustic, far from the caustic, and near the axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
