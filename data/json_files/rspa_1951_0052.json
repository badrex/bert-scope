It explains how gravity data can be used to determine the geoid's separation from the spheroid, deflexions at the origin, and other essential elements for accurate geodetic survey computations. The author emphasizes the significance of widespread gravity surveys using gravimeters to obtain a detailed knowledge of the gravity field and improve the accuracy of geodetic surveys."}
