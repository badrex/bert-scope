They show that certain B.M.S. representations contain countably infinite direct sums of Poincar\u00e9 spins, while others contain direct integrals of continuous Poincar\u00e9 spins. This study helps in understanding the composition of B.M.S. representations out of Poincar\u00e9 irreducibles and provides insights into the determination of new quantum numbers associated with non-connected little groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
