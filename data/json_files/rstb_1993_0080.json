They found that these complexes contain different proportions of chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and peridinin, and play different roles in the photosynthetic process. The second complex, containing chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, and peridinin in a 1:1:2 molar ratio, represents the major light-harvesting complex in dinoflagellates. The third complex appears to be the core of photosystem I, associated with a light-harvesting complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
