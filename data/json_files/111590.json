Elefanti, investigates the way of transforming various series of integer terms into arithmetical progressions, such as the sums of squares, cubes, and powers of numbers. He also demonstrates the resolution of a given number into arithmetical progressions in certain cases. Among the theorems, one notable example is the series 1, 3, 5, 7, where specific combinations of four terms consistently consist of numbers prime to one another.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
