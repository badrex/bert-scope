They discovered that a certain amount of power is necessary to create a current, and that the behavior of the current changes depending on the potential and the type of tube used. The author also observed different colors of light emitted from the positive and negative poles, and the effect of an electromagnetic field on the discharge of electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
