They discovered that chlorocruorin acts as an oxygen carrier in Sabella at all temperatures and oxygen pressures the worms experience in their natural environment. The study found that the oxygen consumption of Sabella decreases when the concentration of dissolved oxygen in the sea water falls below the value corresponding to air saturation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
