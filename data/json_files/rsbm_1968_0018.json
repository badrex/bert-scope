His work on tactile receptors in insects and the physiology of hearing in insects led to a better understanding of these sensory systems. Pumphrey also conducted pioneering studies on nerve fibers of molluscs and crustaceans, and his research on the frog's skin helped elucidate the mechanisms of ion transport.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
