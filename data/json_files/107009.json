These balls were found in a fault or break in the strata filled with shale and softer earth. The limestone balls were used for cement, and their unique form suggested they were formed from a more fluid state while revolving. The author speculates that the base of the nearby hills may be limestone, and the balls were likely thrown into the fault from a mass beneath by volcanic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
