{"article_id": "rspb_1940_0049", "revised_title": "Ultra-Violet Light Induced Mutations in Drosophila", "semantic_tags": ["Genetics", "Mutation", "Radiation", "Drosophila", "Biology"], "tldr": "The authors conducted experiments to study the effects of ultra-violet light on mutations in Drosophila. They found that ultra-violet light can induce mutations without causing gross structural changes in chromosomes. The gene mutations produced by ultra-violet light occur secondarily, as a consequence of energy transfer from nucleic acids, resulting in changes to the gene material, which is likely protein-based. This research supports the idea that genes represent specific segments of the chromonema with different connections between them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
