Researchers found that cells such as monkey cones, cat cones, cat-type horizontal cells, and cat alpha-ganglion cells are arranged in a regular mosaic pattern. The precision of this mosaic decreases in the order of monkey cones, cat cones, cat-type horizontal cells, and cat alpha-ganglion cells. The study also discusses the advantages of a regular arrangement compared to a random distribution and the mechanisms that could generate a regular mosaic.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
