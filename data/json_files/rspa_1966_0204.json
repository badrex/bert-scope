The author analyzes the inner and outer regions of the boundary layer and matches the solutions to find the skin friction and displacement thickness. The results provide insights into the behavior of boundary layers with strong blowing and have implications for fluid dynamics and engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
