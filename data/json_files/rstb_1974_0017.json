The researchers found that nuclear pores are irregularly distributed over the envelope surface and that their frequency may vary depending on the metabolic activity of the cell. The study also provides insights into the intricate structure of the pore complex, which plays a crucial role in the transport of materials between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
