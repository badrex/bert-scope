They also calculated mass polarization, relativistic, and radiative corrections to their energies. The hydrogenic approximation was applied to the helium iso-electronic sequence, and the authors discussed the convergence of quantities depending on the first-order correction to the wave function.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
