The trocart allows for gradual evacuation of the excess fluid, reducing the risk of complications. The author also discusses the implications of this procedure for understanding apoplexy, a type of stroke, and cautions against relying too heavily on theories in medical practice.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurosurgery"}
