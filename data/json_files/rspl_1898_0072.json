They discovered that the effectiveness of anti-venomous serum depends on how it is introduced into the body. Mixing the venom and anti-toxin prior to injection is more effective than injecting them separately but simultaneously. This suggests that anti-toxins are absorbed more slowly from subcutaneous spaces, while toxins are rapidly absorbed. The author recommends injecting anti-venomous serum intravenously to enhance its potency in treating snake bites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
