It highlights that the annual production rate has reached the level of average annual discoveries over the last 25 years, and the remaining proved recoverable reserves may decline continuously as production rates continue to grow. The author forecasts that the demand for crude oil will continue to increase to 1985, but the declining reserves will be insufficient to support the forecast demand after about 1978. The challenges of finding new reserves and the impact of economic circumstances on oil reserves and production are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Economics > Energy and Natural Resources"}
