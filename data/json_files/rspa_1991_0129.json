The solution uses general dislocation equations applicable for plane strain elastic-plastic conditions and considers dislocation crack tip shielding and the dislocation crack extension force. The findings have broader applications beyond the specific problem addressed in the paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Solid Mechanics"}
