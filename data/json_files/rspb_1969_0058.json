They created a specific antibody against free angiotensin II by immunizing rabbits with angiotensin II adsorbed on micro-particles of carbon. This method allowed them to measure angiotensin II levels in various physiological and pathological states, providing a better understanding of the hormone's role in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
