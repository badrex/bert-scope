He finds that indigo is closely related to substances like haematine and urine pigment and suggests that it may help eliminate excess carbon in the body. This is particularly relevant in cases of extensive tubercular disease of the lungs, where the decarbonizing functions of the organs are greatly impaired.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Human Health"}
