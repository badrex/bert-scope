They discovered that connective tissue corpuscles exist among the epithelium and play a role in fat absorption. The research also found that the lining endothelium of the lymph vessels is in anatomical continuity with the connective tissue stroma, suggesting that fat is absorbed through the processes of the connective tissue and then enters the lymph vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Histology"}
