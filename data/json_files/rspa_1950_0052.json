The study examines the behavior of the interface between two fluids of different densities and the effect of acceleration on a liquid sheet of finite thickness. The research provides insights into the amplification of unstable disturbances and the conditions under which they occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
