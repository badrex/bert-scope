They find an exact solution for confocal textures, which are characterized by equidistant and parallel curved layers. The equilibrium textures can be obtained through a geometrical construction, and the main result is the existence of confined distortions and faceted textures for certain boundary conditions and surface energy functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
