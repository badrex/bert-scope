Dixon's Experiments", "semantic_tags": ["Gas explosions", "Explosion-wave", "Chemical reactions", "Flame propagation", "Gas mixtures"], "tldr": "This article discusses the experiments conducted by Harold B. Dixon on the rate of explosion in gases. Dixon aimed to understand the factors affecting the explosion rate, such as the diameter of the tube, initial pressure, and initial temperature. The experiments led to the discovery of the maximum velocity of explosion for each gaseous mixture, which became an essential concept in the study of explosions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
