The data collected helped to understand the phenomena of tides and improve the accuracy of tide predictions. The observations were made at various locations, and the results provided valuable information about the height of the surface at high and low tide times. This research contributed to the understanding of tidal patterns and the development of better tide prediction methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
