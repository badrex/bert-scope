The authors report nonlinear Fabry-Perot response under different experimental conditions and observe optical switching and bistability in the transmission of a room-temperature etalon. They compare these results with the reported work on InSb and explain the underlying mechanisms of optical nonlinearities in CdHgTe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
