They found that severe local oedema formation and fluid loss into the site of injury can cause changes in plasma electrolyte concentrations. These changes include a fall in sodium and chloride and a rise in potassium. The authors also observed similar electrocardiographic changes in anhydraemic rabbits to those in animals with artificially raised plasma potassium concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pathology and Forensic Medicine"}
