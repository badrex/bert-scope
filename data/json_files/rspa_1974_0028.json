It discusses their properties, such as symmetry, existence, and uniqueness, and provides proofs for homographic invariance and reciprocal invariance. The authors also define three-variable and -variable approximants, generalizing the two-variable case, and outline their geometrical configurations and associated properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Approximation Theory"}
