They found that different types of mutations have various effects on cancer growth, and the effectiveness of the immune response depends on how the mutation affects biochemical control of cell division. The model suggests that the immune system can suppress tumor growth when the removal rate of mutant cells exceeds a critical value.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Biology"}
