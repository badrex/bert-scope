The study focuses on the practical application of hydroelasticity to non-beamlike ships, specifically SWATH ships. The research demonstrates the flexibility of applying hydroelasticity as a unified research tool and design aid at different design stages, from conceptual to detailed design. The findings can help establish hydroelasticity as an essential technique in the study of sea-going vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture and Ocean Engineering"}
