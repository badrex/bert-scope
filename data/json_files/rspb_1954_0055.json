They found that these anions increase the duration of the active state after a shock, leading to increased tension and heat production in a twitch. The results suggest that the duration of the active state is determined by a process happening at the surface of the muscle fibers, rather than being an intrinsic property of the contractile mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
