He also found that plants can be frozen and lose their properties, suggesting a difference in their ability to withstand cold temperatures compared to animals. These findings contribute to the understanding of thermoregulation in living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
