The authors study the effects of salt concentration, pressure, and temperature on the water-clay system using techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance. They find that the surface force fields in clay gels affect the rotational motion of water molecules and create a surface phase with distinct properties compared to the bulk phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
