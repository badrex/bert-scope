The charges are found to be carried by the liquid fragments ejected from the crown, with the surface generally left with a positive charge. The research also explores the effects of impact speed, drop size, temperature, and applied electric fields on charge separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
