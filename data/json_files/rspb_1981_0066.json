The research reveals that male moths have a male-specific neuropil region called the macroglomerular complex, which contains dendritic branches of pheromone-sensitive local interneurons and output neurons. This discovery provides insights into the olfactory mechanisms of insects and their role in behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
