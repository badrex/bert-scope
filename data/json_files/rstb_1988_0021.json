It examines the definition and history of cold stages, the biological and physical evidence for these climates, and the challenges of interpreting them. The article also reviews the record of climatic change based on periglacial phenomena and fossil floras and faunas, and considers the problems of interpreting cold-stage climates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
