They described the structure and relations of the lymphatic reservoirs and valveless efferent vessels. They also discussed the basement membrane, absorption, and the minute anatomy of the lymphatics in the intestine. The authors provided a series of camera-lucida drawings to illustrate their research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
