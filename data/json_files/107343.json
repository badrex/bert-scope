They observe that roots grow in the direction of favorable soil conditions and moisture, and that they can adapt to different environments. The author explains that this growth is not due to instinct, but rather the result of simple laws of nature, such as gravitation and the availability of nutrients.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
