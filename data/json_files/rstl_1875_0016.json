They used various methods, such as the cautery, to remove specific parts of the brain and observed the resulting changes in the monkeys' behavior. The experiments showed that the antero-frontal regions of the hemispheres were responsible for motion and sensation, while other parts played a role in curiosity, attention, and response to stimuli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
