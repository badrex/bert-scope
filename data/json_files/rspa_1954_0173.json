They found that lattice vacancies formed on the evaporation of water molecules from the surfaces of crystals have limited mobility. The authors conducted experiments to understand the mechanism of water molecule loss and the role of water vapor in nucleation. Their findings provide insights into the prenucleation processes and the role of nucleation in the propagation of the interface between the two solid phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
