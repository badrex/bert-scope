Researchers found that some invertebrates, like Chironomus larvae and Heterocypris incongruens, thrive better in poorly aerated water. The results show that these invertebrates can survive and even grow better in water with lower oxygen levels, which could have implications for understanding their habitats and survival strategies in the wild.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology"}
