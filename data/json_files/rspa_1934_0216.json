They analyze the energies of these rays and discuss the differences between the energies of beta and gamma rays from various elements. The study also examines the suspension of small particles and bubbles against gravity in a radiation field and its implications for the design of torsion balances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
