They found that the delay to ignition can be expressed by an Arrhenius equation and that the heat sensitiveness of explosives depends on the activation energy of the physico-chemical process controlling it. The author also discovered that initiators like lead azide can be permanently sensitized by heat treatment or photochemical action, which affects their ignition times.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
