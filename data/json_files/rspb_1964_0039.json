They found a diverse range of plant life, including arctic birch, dwarf willows, and various dry-land plants. The plant evidence, along with animal remains, suggests that the late-Weichselian vegetation was without woodland, and the region experienced temporary and local changes in climate during the later part of the last glaciation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
