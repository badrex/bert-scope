The author examines various limiting cases and their effects on the fluid dynamics, including the drag on the body and the existence of upstream and downstream wakes. The study aims to reconcile different approaches and provide a better understanding of the complex interactions between the fluid, magnetic field, and body.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
