They found that metallic arcs, such as copper, silver, and iron, experienced greater pressures than a carbon arc. The authors attributed the pressure to a recoil caused by the projection of electrons from the poles, which is supported by the order of magnitude of the calculated values associated with electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
