They found that by adjusting the center of gravity and using a disk with a zone of 60\u00b0, they could achieve a greater initial velocity and better sustained terminal velocity compared to spherical shot and rifle projectiles. The author also discussed the history of the eccentric principle and its applications in warfare.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
