They observed symptoms of mountain sickness, changes in breathing, and blood hemoglobin levels in themselves and other participants. The study provided valuable insights into the adaptation process to high altitudes and the importance of acclimatization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
