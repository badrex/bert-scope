The researchers found that the pupil mechanism helps prevent receptor saturation and extends the range of intensities at which fly photoreceptors operate near their maximum signal-to-noise ratio. The study also provides estimates of the number of transduction units generating photoreceptor responses and the effective attenuation caused by the pupil.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
