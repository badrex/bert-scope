The researchers discovered a novel lyotropic liquid crystalline arrangement, which is different from the twisted nematic construction. The spinnerets play a crucial role in controlling molecular orientations in the egg case, providing insights into the development and health of collagenous composite materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
