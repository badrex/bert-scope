They observed a strong discrete spectrum and compared it with Hartree-Fock calculations to establish the energy of the absorption thresholds. The results provide insights into the differences between atomic and metallic spectra of chromium and help interpret the observed features.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
