He also discusses the heart structure in various species, including the turbot, wolf-fish, Lophius piscatorius, Teredines, and oyster. Home observes that the bronchial artery's muscularity is connected to living at great depths, and he describes the urinary passages and reproductive systems of the Squalus maximus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
