The lasers produce intense beams of ultraviolet light, which can create finer details on microchips than current methods. The author describes initial experiments with these lasers and the development of optical systems to improve their performance. The use of excimer lasers has the potential to increase the scale of detail on microchips, allowing for more circuit elements per unit area.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics and Photonics"}
