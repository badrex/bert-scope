The research shows that conidium morphology, particularly the number of contact points, affects initial attachment. The formation of appressoria significantly increases the strength of attachment at higher shear stresses. The findings contribute to understanding the colonization process of aquatic fungi in turbulent environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
