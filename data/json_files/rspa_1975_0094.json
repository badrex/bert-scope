This method, a non-standard two-timing technique, can treat arbitrary time-dependent flow fields and tubes of arbitrary cross-section. The authors provide a series of approximations in powers of a parameter, which can be used to determine terms up to any given order. The results clarify conditions under which the Taylor-Aris theory is valid and extend the theory to more general cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
