They discovered that Spirillum undergoes a transformation from a motile to a resting state, forming spores that can germinate into more Spirillum. This process is similar to the life-history of other bacteria, such as Bacillus. The authors also found that the spores can encapsulate and divide, forming capsules that can become motile and eventually give rise to the common motile Spirillum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
