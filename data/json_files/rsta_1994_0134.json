The authors study the different forms of carbon found in these meteorites, such as low-temperature carbon components LC1 and LC2, and their isotopic compositions. The research helps to understand the origin and evolution of surface processes on Mars.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth and Environmental Sciences > Planetary Science"}
