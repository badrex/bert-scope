It examines the consequences of assuming that the relaxation frequency decays algebraically with temperature and derives the structure and position of these de-excitation shocks for power-law nozzle shapes. The article also discusses the asymptotic limiting solutions downstream of the de-excitation shocks and the role of pseudo-entropy in understanding the flow behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
