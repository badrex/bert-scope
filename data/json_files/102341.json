He explains how fish lack lungs and breathe through gills, how their single-ventricle heart functions without lungs, and how their stomach and intestines are adapted for consuming various types of food. He also discusses fish reproduction, including the role of the ovaries and the process of egg-laying. Additionally, he explores the function of the swim bladder, which helps fish maintain buoyancy and enables them to swim."}
