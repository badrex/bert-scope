They find that the colors are due to interference, not pigments. The study includes Morpho butterflies, Urania moths, and golden beetles. The colors of feathers and insects are lost when exposed to chlorine gas, but not due to the destruction of pigments. The fading is attributed to the breaking down of an interference structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
