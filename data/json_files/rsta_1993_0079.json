It explores the role of hydrocarbon compounds, hydrogen balances, and the incorporation of sulfur into phytol. The authors also discuss the difficulty in measuring 'free' H2 and the influence of aqueous organics on redox reactions. They examine the origins of Fe and S and the timing/temperature of formation of their products, as well as the potential evidence of reduction in the Gulf Coast.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Environmental Geochemistry"}
