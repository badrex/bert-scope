The author explains the challenges and techniques involved in making these measurements, such as using the Dicke radiometer and balloon-borne instruments. The current state of research on anisotropy is explored, with a focus on the potential implications for cosmological parameters and processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
