The article provides a synopsis of these effects and illustrates them with theoretical predictions and experimental examples from the author's work in Zurich. Topics covered include quantum nonlinearity in infrared multiphoton excitation and reaction, non-classical wavepacket spreading in Fermi resonance coupled modes in molecules, effects of zero-point energy and angular momentum in unimolecular reactions, and nuclear spin symmetry conservation and interconversion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
