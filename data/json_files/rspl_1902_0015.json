They observed that arterial walls contract and change shape after death, which can affect measurements and understanding of blood vessels. They also investigated the factors that influence this contraction, such as exposure to air, temperature, and chemical substances like chloroform and suprarenal extract.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
