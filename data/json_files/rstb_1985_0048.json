The results show that both types of stimuli can trigger diffuse noxious inhibitory controls (DNIC), with somatic stimuli producing stronger effects than visceral stimuli. The findings suggest that DNIC can be triggered by large distensions of single abdominal viscera and may involve the medullary nucleus raphe magnus (NRM).", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
