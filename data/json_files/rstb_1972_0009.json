The authors analyze the geological and paleontological evidence from Brazil and West Africa, concluding that the final break between South America and Africa occurred during the Upper Lower Turonian. The study contributes to the understanding of continental drift and the development of the South Atlantic Ocean.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
