The results show that these complexes have a different membrane structure than the axolemma, suggesting a sequential mode of membrane development where a relatively undifferentiated membrane bilayer is followed by the insertion of specialized proteins within specific membrane domains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
