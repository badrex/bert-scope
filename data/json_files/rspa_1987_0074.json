The authors determine the critical value of the Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and the corresponding steady temperature distribution for uniform surface temperature and Newtonian cooling. They find that the nearly circular cylinder is less stable than a regular shape with the same mean radius.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Heat Transfer"}
