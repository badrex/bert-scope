He provided a detailed description of the development and arrangement of the nerves, the changes they undergo during the larva and pupa stages, and the similarities to the nervous systems of vertebrates. Newport also discussed the future plans for further investigation of the remaining stages of metamorphosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
