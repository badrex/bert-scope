They found that the substance has a linear molecular symmetry and provided a more refined normal coordinate treatment for the interpretation of the new data. The study involved the preparation and purification of carbon suboxide, as well as the analysis of its Raman and infra-red spectra using advanced spectroscopic techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
