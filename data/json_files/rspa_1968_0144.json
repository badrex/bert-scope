They found that the detonation limits and velocities are affected by the type of diluent used, with argon extending the detonation limits more than helium. The authors suggest that certain diluents, like helium, promote rapid equilibration with internal degrees of freedom, cooling down the peak translational temperature faster than less active catalysts. The formation of solid detonation products and the energy transfer between them play a significant role in the detonation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Kinetics"}
