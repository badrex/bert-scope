Through the analysis of fossils found in the area, the author concludes that the sandstone is of Triassic age, providing overwhelming paleontological evidence to support this claim. The author also discusses the stratigraphical evidence and the challenges in correlating the geological age of the formation due to the disturbances and limited exposures of the rocks in the district.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Stratigraphy"}
