They found that the most common clone was significantly over-infected in one population, significantly under-infected in two other populations, and proportionately infected in the fourth population by the predominant castrating parasite. The results support the Red Queen theory for the maintenance of sex, which suggests that parasites evolve to infect the most common of local host genotypes, preventing their spread.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
