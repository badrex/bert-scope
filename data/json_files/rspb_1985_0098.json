They conclude that the presence of a calcium-gated potassium current in the cell membrane, along with a voltage-gated potassium current, makes the cell behave as a simple resistance-inductance-capacitance circuit showing resonant behavior. This electrical tuning allows for frequency discrimination in the inner ear and may be used in various species for auditory and vestibular functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
