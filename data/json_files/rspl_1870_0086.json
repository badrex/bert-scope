W. L. Glaisher, corrects inaccuracies in the calculation of Euler's constant and presents a new method for calculating the constant. He discusses the use of the harmonic series and Bernoulli numbers in the calculation and verifies the accuracy of his results by comparing them to previous values. Glaisher also addresses errors in Shanks' calculations and provides a more accurate value for Euler's constant to 100 decimal places.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
