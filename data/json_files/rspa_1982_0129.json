They modify and expand the Stokes stream function series to accommodate a wide variety of tubes and provide numerical calculations for several terms. The theory has a wide applicability and can be used to predict flow dynamics in tubes with bounded radii and varying shapes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
