It discusses various methods for determining skull capacity and explores the differences in skull measurements between different races. The study also examines the concept of personal errors in direct determination and the use of regression equations in reconstructing organs in living individuals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Evolution"}
