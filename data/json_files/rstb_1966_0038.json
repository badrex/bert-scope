The ceremony consists of two parts: the gander's attack on a conspecific, accompanied by 'rolling' sounds, and his return to his mate, during which the rolling subsides into a low-pitched cackling. This behavior is an example of ritualization, where aggressive and escape drives are redirected into a highly coordinated and autonomous motor pattern. The study highlights the importance of understanding animal behavior and its implications for human society.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
