They found that high pressure regions are present in the center of the muscle belly, and the highest pressures are predicted for muscles with long tendinous sheets, large attachment angles, and strongly curved fibers. The model was tested by comparing it to the architecture of the cat's medial gastrocnemius muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Anatomy and Physiology"}
