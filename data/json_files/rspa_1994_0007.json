The model considers the mechanics of droplet and gas motion in liquid sprays and is compared with a two-dimensional axisymmetric model. The results are in good agreement with experimental measurements, providing a basis for optimizing nozzle designs and understanding environmental processes involving droplet ejection.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Mechanics"}
