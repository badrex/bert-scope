The authors describe the gene structure, linkage, and evolution of Rubisco genes, as well as their expression in various plant organs and cell types. They also explain how light induction affects the expression of Rubisco genes in transgenic plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
