The research calculates the power flow from the panels, considering mechanical excitation and accounting for both resonance and non-resonance contributions. The findings provide an improved and unified theory for the acoustic radiation from plates, with implications for applications in acoustic engineering and helicopter internal noise reduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Acoustics and Vibration"}
