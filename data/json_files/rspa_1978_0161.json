Approximation and Scaling in Quantum Mechanics", "semantic_tags": ["Quantum Mechanics", "Approximation Theory", "Scaling Behavior", "Schr\u00f6dinger Equation", "Hamiltonian Mechanics"], "tldr": "This article demonstrates that the W.K.B. approximation and scaling behavior of eigenvalues in the Schr\u00f6dinger equation are retained for polynomial potentials. The author shows that the W.K.B. eigenvalues and eigenfunctions satisfy the Hellmann-Feynman theorem and the virial theorem, which determine the scaling of exact eigenvalues with respect to parameters in the Hamiltonian.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
