The device features a U-tube with a fine-bore connecting tube containing an index bubble, allowing for precise readings. The sensitiveness of the gauge depends on the ratio between the bores of the limbs and the connecting tube, as well as the fluid used. The device can be employed with various fluids, such as alcohol, ether, or pentane, depending on the desired level of sensitivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
