They discovered that direct sunlight can kill or inhibit the growth of these spores, suggesting that sunlight could be a powerful tool in purifying the air and water of bacteria. The experiments also showed that different wavelengths of light have varying effects on the spores, with blue light being more effective at inhibiting their growth than red light.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
