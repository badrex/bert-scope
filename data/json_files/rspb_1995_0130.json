The researchers found that neither the number of sperm nor the proportion of live sperm in the ejaculate differed significantly between males. The study also determined the instantaneous rate at which sperm were lost from the female reproductive tract and the mean duration of sperm storage, which are both intermediate compared to other galliformes. The results suggest that female peafowl may not gain direct fertility benefits from choosing to copulate with specific males based on ejaculate quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
