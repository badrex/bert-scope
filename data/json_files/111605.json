They investigated the distribution of chemical activity on Earth's surface and determined the chemical brightness of different portions of the sky. This research laid the foundation for a new branch of meteorological science, studying the chemical climate and the effects of solar rays on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
