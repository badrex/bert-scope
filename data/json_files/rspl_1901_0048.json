They found that the gradation becomes steeper as the wave-lengths of light employed depart from a specific point in the spectrum, with the least steep gradation given by the monochromatic light to which the simple silver salt is most sensitive. This research has implications for three-color printing and the challenges of rendering objects in their natural colors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
