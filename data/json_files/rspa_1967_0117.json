The authors examine the effects of changes in reaction parameters and transport properties on flame properties and compare the results with experimental data. They also discuss the validity of the assumption of equilibration of OH radicals in the burnt gas region of such flames.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion"}
