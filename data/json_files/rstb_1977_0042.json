The research demonstrates that the intertectal system can undergo small-scale plasticity in post-metamorphic life, allowing it to adjust and compensate for changes in interocular distance and angle. This plasticity is essential for maintaining a detailed congruence of the ipsilateral and contralateral visuotectal connections throughout the animal's life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
