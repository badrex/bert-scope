Iridium is harder than steel and is resistant to mechanical treatment, oxidation, and various chemicals. It maintains its shape and weight even after prolonged use and exposure to harsh conditions. The author also mentions that rhodium crucibles have similar properties and advantages.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
