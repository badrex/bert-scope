Gassiot, describes the construction and use of a large spectroscope with nine prisms and achromatic telescopes for enhanced spectrum analysis. The instrument allows for precise observation and comparison of spectra from various sources, such as thallium, strontium, and lithium, using different methods like Bunsen's gas-burner, oxyhydrogen blowpipe, and voltaic arc. The author highlights the importance of this instrument and its potential for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
