They found that the error was due to a mistake in the computer program's orientation angle calculation. The corrected paper confirms that the reciprocity theorem is satisfied for random orientation, and the scattering and absorption efficiencies remain unaffected.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
