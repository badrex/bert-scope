The study aims to understand the underlying mechanisms and time relations of this phenomenon, which is similar to mental distraction. The author presents various experiments and discusses different hypotheses to explain the behavior of osglim lamps and their potential applications in understanding reciprocal inhibition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
