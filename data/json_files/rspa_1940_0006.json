The authors found that the scattering of mesotrons is mainly due to the Coulomb field of the nucleus, and the distribution of scattering angles follows a Gaussian pattern. The study also estimates the action cross-section of mesotrons with nuclear particles, contributing to the understanding of mesotron-proton and mesotron-neutron interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
