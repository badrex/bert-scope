They discovered that when bacteria are exposed to sub-inhibitory concentrations of a drug, they can develop the ability to synthesize folic acid more efficiently, making them resistant to the drug. This resistance can be reversible or irreversible depending on the drug concentration and the duration of exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
