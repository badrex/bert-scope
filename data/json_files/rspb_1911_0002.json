The researchers found that this species of trypanosome is morphologically indistinguishable from Trypanosoma pecorum and does not infect smaller laboratory animals. The carrier of the disease is believed to be a species of biting fly other than Glossina, but further research is needed to identify the exact carrier.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
