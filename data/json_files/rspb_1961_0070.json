The clinging response of the anemone to shells is found to depend on a general molluscan shell-factor, and the anemone establishes the association without the crab's assistance. The research provides insights into the factors involved in the anemone's response to a shell and the movements required for successful settlement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
