These enumerations can be expressed as mean powers of appropriate series of bases, yielding integral values for all integral exponents. The paper provides a combinatorial theorem and illustrates its application in confirming and extending established genetic formulae.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics"}
