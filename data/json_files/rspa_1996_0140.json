The study focuses on the non-soliton part of the system and uses inverse scattering theory and Riemann-Hilbert factorization to analyze the problem, ultimately reducing it to a similar problem for the Toda lattice. The results provide explicit asymptotic formulae for the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
