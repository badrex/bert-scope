They used Hartree-Fock calculations to interpret the spectrum and found that all observed features can be attributed to excitation of the 3p-subshell. This research helps improve our understanding of the KI spectrum and its potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic physics"}
