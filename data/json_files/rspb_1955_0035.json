They observe that plant cells can grow in size but do not divide. The cells show active protoplasmic streaming and cyclosis, and their behavior is studied using phase-contrast microscopy. The author concludes that isolated plant cells are not capable of cell division under the described conditions and a different procedure must be used to achieve cell multiplication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
