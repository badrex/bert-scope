They find that sodium azide inhibits cellular respiration, the oxidation of cytochrome, and the activity of catalase, similar to cyanide. The study also shows that sodium azide forms a compound with methaemoglobin, and its inhibitory effect on various enzymes and cellular respiration depends on the pH of the medium."}
