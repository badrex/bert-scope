They discovered that ATPase activity increased with calcium concentration and mechanical extension, and oscillation at specific frequencies led to further increases in ATPase activity. These findings suggest that mechanical events can directly impact myofibrillar enzymatic activity in a constant chemical environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
