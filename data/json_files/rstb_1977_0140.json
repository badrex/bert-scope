The authors define efficiency in thermodynamic terms and analyze the relationship between intercepted solar radiation and the efficiency of using that light for growth. They find that the major arable crops in Britain intercept only about 40% of annual solar radiation and have an efficiency of about 0.3% for supplying energy through economic yield. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the factors responsible for the differences between average commercial and record yields.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Climate"}
