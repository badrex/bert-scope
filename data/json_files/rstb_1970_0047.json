The authors explore the factors influencing the germ cells' distribution and the role of gravitational forces in their localization. They also compare their findings to other vertebrates, contributing to a unitarian theory of the germ cell line in vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
