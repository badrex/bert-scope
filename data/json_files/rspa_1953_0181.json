They found that the ratio of the probability of this alternative mode of decay to the transformation into two photons is 1. This discovery provided strong evidence for the mode of origin of the mesons and allowed for a direct method to determine their lifetime.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
