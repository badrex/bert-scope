It examines the chemistry of vanadium in physiological environments, considering factors such as vanadium concentration, coordinating ligands, presence of other cations, oxidation-reduction potentials, and the kinetics of vanadium-containing species. The study suggests that vanadium will exist in specific hydrated forms and will be bound to bi- or tridentate ligands. The transmembrane potential will be coupled to the Nernstian potential if oxidation-reduction processes involving vanadium are fast.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
