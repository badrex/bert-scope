They found that the rate of deoxygenation and the effects of -chloromercuribenzoate on the reactions were complex, providing insights into the mechanisms of oxygen and carbon monoxide interactions with haemoglobin. This research contributes to understanding the fundamental processes of oxygen transport in the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
