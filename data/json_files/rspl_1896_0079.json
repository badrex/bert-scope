The author, Oliver Lodge, verifies Dr. P. Zeeman's findings and explains how the effect is connected to the interchange of energy between ether and matter. The discovery is linked to the work of Lorentz, who developed a theory that describes the interaction between matter and ether through the movement of electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
