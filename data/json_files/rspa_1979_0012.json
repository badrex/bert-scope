The study focuses on the thermodynamics of shells and the restrictions imposed by the second law of thermodynamics. The authors also discuss symmetries and thermal effects in the nonlinear theory of elastic shells, with a detailed analysis of the linear theory of elastic plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
