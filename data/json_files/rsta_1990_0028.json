The authors compare 14C records in tree rings with 10Be records in ice cores to understand short-term and long-term variations in cosmic radiation. They discuss the stability of the carbon system and its potential influence on atmospheric 14C:12C ratios, as well as the impact of carbon system changes on the Earth's climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
