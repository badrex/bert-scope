They mention that in 1926, the late Professor Sir Christopher Ingold reversed the sign convention from -I to +I, as the differential coefficient of an increasing quantity is positive. This sign reversal has been generally accepted and is used worldwide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
