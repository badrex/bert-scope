They do not convey steric information essential for assembly but help by binding to transiently exposed protein surfaces, preventing incorrect interactions. This concept challenges the traditional view of protein self-assembly and suggests that in vivo assembly requires assistance from other proteins. Molecular chaperones include various unrelated families, such as chaperonins and heat shock proteins, which have different functions and mechanisms of action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
