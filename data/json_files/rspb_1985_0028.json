The distribution and single-channel properties of these receptors were examined using radioautography and the patch-clamp technique. The study found a single-channel conductance of 40-45 pS and complex channel closed-time distributions at various ACh concentrations. The results provide insights into the functional properties of ACh-activated ion channels in human muscle cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
