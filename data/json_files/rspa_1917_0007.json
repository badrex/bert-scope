They find the streamlines and reaction between the solid and fluid, and determine the pressure at any point. The study also explores the forces and couple exerted by fluid pressure on a solid moving in a rotating fluid, and how these forces change when the system is rotated.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
