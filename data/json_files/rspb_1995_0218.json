The authors analyze the data and methods used in previous studies, criticizing the pooling of data for different species and habitats. They conclude that there is no statistical evidence to support the claim that northern microtine populations are characterized by chaotic dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
