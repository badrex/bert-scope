They introduce a self-consistent field and local field correction effects, and express the energy in terms of eigenvalues of a certain homogeneous integral equation. The theory is applied to crystals, and an approximate expression for the correlation energy of a metal is derived, neglecting Lorentz-Lorenz correction effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
