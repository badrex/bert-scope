Smeaton, describes a new method for observing celestial bodies out of the meridian using a transit telescope. The method involves tracking a fixed star and a heavenly body, noting their times of passage, and calculating their altitude and azimuth. This technique is useful for observations near the horizon and is free from the need to consider refractions. The author also suggests using the Sun for observations of planets during daylight.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
