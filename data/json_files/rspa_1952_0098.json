They find that this method provides a better approximation than the first-order Born-Oppenheimer method, especially when exchange effects are important. The distorted wave method can be useful for treating collisions where exchange effects are large, such as the excitation of the 2s level of atomic hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
