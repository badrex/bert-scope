They summarize the structure of attachments and the formation of haustoria, which penetrate the host's cambium, and the different behaviors observed in these interactions. The study highlights the flexibility of these relationships and the wide range of attachments formed based on the relative size and vigor of the parasite and host.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
