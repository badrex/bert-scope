They discovered synaptopores, which are small structures that may serve as attachment sites for synaptic vesicles. This research suggests that neurotransmitter release may occur through a different mechanism than previously thought, involving a close relationship between vesicles and the presynaptic membrane.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
