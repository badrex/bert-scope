They focus on the mechanics of thin liquid films, considering them as two-dimensional elastic surfaces. The theory can describe the response of surfactant films on liquid drops and interfaces between immiscible liquids. The authors derive equilibrium equations for the films and demonstrate that the surface tension is non-negative and the strain energy is convex at the value of the local film dilation associated with a minimizer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
