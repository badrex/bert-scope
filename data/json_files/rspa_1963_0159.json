They tested the validity of the theoretical relation between radiative lifetime and absorption intensity and the mirror-image relation between fluorescence and absorption spectra. The results showed that the modified Strickler-Berg equation and the mirror-image relation were generally valid, with some exceptions due to changes in nuclear configuration.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
