They discovered that the radiations are not continuous but composed of a recurrent series of discharges with different strengths and directions. This finding supports the theory that electrical discharges in vacuum tubes are disruptive in nature. The authors also found that even the so-called continuous discharge is made up of very rapidly recurring discharges, each composed of a group of elemental discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
