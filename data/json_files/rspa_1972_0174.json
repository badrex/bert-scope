They identified the nsnp features in both Zn and Cd and found that the autoionization probability for the Cd level is 4.16 and for the Zn level is 0. They determined the configuration-mixing coefficients and the capture cross-section for the continuum associated with the resonance at 310.7. This study helps to understand the behavior of atoms and their interactions with radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
