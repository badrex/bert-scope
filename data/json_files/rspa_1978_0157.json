During the drought, the efficiency of sewage treatment improved due to reduced sewage flows and higher temperatures. However, the drought also created problems at individual treatment works and led to increased algal blooms and animal infestations in reservoirs and river systems. The drought's impact on water supply included deterioration in the fabric of distribution systems, increased organic content in surface waters, and concerns about alternative water sources for emergency use.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology and Water Resources"}
