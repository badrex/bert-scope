By measuring the specific gravity of various mixtures, Blagden aimed to establish a fair tax system based on alcohol content. The study involved multiple experiments, taking into account factors such as temperature and evaporation, to ensure accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Taxation and Alcohol Content"}
