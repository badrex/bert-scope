The authors found that the dough's viscosity decreases as the shearing stress increases. They also discovered that the rate of shear under a given stress is not uniform and diminishes as the shearing proceeds. This research provides insights into the mechanical properties of dough and its behavior under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
