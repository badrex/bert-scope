The plant has a strictly dioecious reproductive system, with ovulate cones bearing flowers that function in a normal acropetal sequence. The cones exhibit xerophytic adaptations, such as closely imbricated scales and a closed structure, which protect the essential parts of the ovule. The author also discusses the pollination mechanism and the simplicity of the plant's organization, which contributes to its efficiency in reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
