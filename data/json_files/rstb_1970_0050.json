It explores three mechanisms for creating chimeric individuals and their implications for germ cell development. The author also examines the behavior of germ cells in chimeric males and the factors that influence their development. The findings provide insights into the complex process of germ cell formation and the role of chimerism in mammalian development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
