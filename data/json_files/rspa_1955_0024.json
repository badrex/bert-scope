The experiments cover ion energies ranging from 3 to 40 keV and 100 to 4000 eV, and the results are discussed in terms of the pseudo-adiabatic hypothesis. The authors compare their findings with other experimental results and discuss anomalous molecular cases in terms of reactions involving anti-bonding states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
