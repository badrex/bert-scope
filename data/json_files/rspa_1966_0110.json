They explore both dipolar and scalar interactions and find that the diffusion model better explains the experimental results. The study allows for the calculation of diffusional correlation times, distances of closest approach, and relative diffusion coefficients of solvent and radical molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
