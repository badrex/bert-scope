They determined the rates of polymerization and radical lifetimes for these monomers. The results showed that the rate of reaction reached a constant value within 0.1 seconds, and the kinetic lifetime was less than 0.1 seconds. The authors also found that the rate of reaction was proportional to the square root of the light intensity, indicating the absence of inhibitor termination.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer chemistry"}
