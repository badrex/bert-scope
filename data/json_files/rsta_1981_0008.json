The authors examine various fracture processes, models, and factors that influence the behavior of cracks in materials, such as carbide films, grain boundaries, and the distribution of impurities. They also explore the application of fracture mechanics principles to predict and improve the toughness of engineering alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
