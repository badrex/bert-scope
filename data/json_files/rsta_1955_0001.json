Image fidelity is proposed as a criterion for evaluating the resemblance of an image to its object, while information content is based on the amount of implicit information that can be extracted from the image. The authors analyze the Fourier treatment of optical imaging and provide a quantitative definition of image fidelity, as well as a detailed analysis of the information content of an optical image under specific conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
