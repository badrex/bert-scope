It shows that individual channel activations contain surprisingly long shut periods and very short interruptions. The results suggest that the slow decay of NMDA receptor-mediated synaptic currents may result mainly from the fact that individual channel activations are long.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Glutamate Receptors"}
