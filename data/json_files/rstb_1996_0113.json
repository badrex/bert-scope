It examines the relationships between seed traits, plant life history, and environmental factors, and discusses the implications of these relationships for plant survival and coexistence. The study uses comparative analysis and phylogenetic information to understand the complex patterns of seed traits and their evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
