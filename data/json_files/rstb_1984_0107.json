The parasites use two mechanisms: antigenic variation and inducing immunosuppression, which affects immune responses to the parasite and unrelated antigens. The cellular basis of immune dysfunction is explored, focusing on the role of macrophages as direct target cells for parasite action. The article highlights the importance of understanding immune function changes during trypanosomiasis to develop better strategies for controlling the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
