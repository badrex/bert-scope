They find that a rotating body does produce an electromagnetic field, specifically a field of the form proposed by Blackett, but other alternative fields may exist. The analysis also shows that a rotating mass of liquid under isotropic pressure can produce an electromagnetic field satisfying certain conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
