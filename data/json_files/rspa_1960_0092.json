They found that the atomic absorption cross-section at the series limit of the auto-ionization lines is double, and the absorption at shorter wavelengths becomes continuous. The results can be used to improve theoretical calculations of absorption coefficients and in astrophysical problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
