They found that the diploid number in all species and hybrids examined was fourteen, with a significant difference in length between the longest and shortest chromosomes. The study also revealed the presence of primary and secondary constrictions in the chromosomes and other structural peculiarities, such as terminal granules and appendages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
