They found that adult female rats were more likely to die or be less caught than males, leading to a skewed sex ratio. This phenomenon was temporary and quickly adjusted, but the cause of the increased female mortality remains unknown.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Population Biology"}
