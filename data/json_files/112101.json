He discovers that the light from the nebula contains three bright lines, indicating gaseous matter. This challenges the idea that the resolution of a nebula into bright stellar points is a certain indication that it consists of discrete stars. Huggins concludes that the nebulae with gaseous spectra have a structure and purpose distinct from the group of cosmical bodies, such as our sun and stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Nebulae and Star Formation"}
