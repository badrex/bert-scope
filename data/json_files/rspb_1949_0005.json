The author describes methods for testing sera for precipitins against seminal proteins and spermatozoal agglutinins. The study aims to understand the antigenic relationships of spermatozoa from different species and detect the presence of antibodies in the genital tract of immunized animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
