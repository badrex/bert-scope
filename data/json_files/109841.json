The author, C. Babbage, aims to determine the value of an unknown function using functional equations, rather than finding a quantity from a known function, as in the direct method. This approach could not be publicly read due to its mode of inquiry.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus and Analysis"}
