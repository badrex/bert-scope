The researchers found that collagen fibril diameter distributions change during fetal development and at birth, with the mean diameters of the distributions lying close to a multiple of 80 \u00c5. The findings confirm previous observations that small collagen fibrils have diameters that are multiples of about 80 \u00c5, and that fibril growth occurs by the accretion of 80 \u00c5 units. The study provides insights into the organization, structure, and function of connective tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
