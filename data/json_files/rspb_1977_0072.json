The authors propose a theoretical relationship between the pressure and volume of tissue gas released upon decompression. They confirm this relationship using human experiments and discuss its implications for understanding and treating decompression sickness. The findings support the bubble theory as a significant factor in the development of decompression sickness.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
