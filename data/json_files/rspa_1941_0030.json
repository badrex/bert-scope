The author finds a lag in the warming of the atmosphere in spring and a similar phenomenon in autumn. This supports the theory that temperature variations of penetrating cosmic rays are related to the instability of the mesotron. The temperature coefficient of cosmic rays, as deduced from seasonal data, is found to be 0.18% per \u00b0C, which is in rough agreement with the prediction of the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
