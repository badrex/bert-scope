The authors conducted experiments using a large ionization chamber and found that the size of the large bursts is proportional to the density of extra-nuclear electrons. The results provide strong evidence that large bursts are formed by long-range, thinly ionizing particles and are complex examples of the shower phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
