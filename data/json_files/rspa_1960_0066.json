They apply this model to K+-proton scattering and discuss the potential's short range and the significance of the s-state in the interaction. The authors also explore the effects of two-nucleon correlations on the shape of the K+ meson optical model potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
