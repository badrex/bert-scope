He tested salts, resins, gums, and plant extracts, comparing their antiseptic properties to that of sea salt. The study revealed that many substances, such as camphire, opium, and certain plant infusions, possess strong antiseptic properties and can help resist putrefaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Medical research"}
