They found that oxidants like paraquat ion, peroxydisulphate ion, and lead tetraacetate produce alkoxy radicals from parent alcohols. The study confirms the intervention of alkoxy radicals in the oxidation process and provides insights into the mechanism and consequences of these reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radical Chemistry"}
