They use a non-metric multidimensional scaling technique to assess dissimilarities between these faunas and suggest explanations for the changes in isolation and merging of these provinces. The study provides insights into the influence of environment and evolution on the diversification of trilobites during the Ordovician period.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobiology"}
