The authors found that Digitalis stimulates vaso-motor nerves, causing a moderate contraction of systemic vessels and raising blood pressure. However, it also affects renal vessels more powerfully, leading to a temporary stop in urine secretion. As the drug's action on systemic vessels subsides, blood pressure falls, and renal arteries may dilate, increasing blood pressure in the kidneys and restarting urine secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pharmacology and Toxicology"}
