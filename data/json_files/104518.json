He proposed that electricity is a subtle and elastic fluid present in all bodies on Earth, and its effects are observed when the balance of this fluid is disturbed. The author also explained the phenomenon of snapping and sparks between electrified objects and how they restore balance to the electrical fluid in the objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
