The dominant-recessive solutions are found to be free of logarithmic terms at all orders of approximation, and the partly balanced solutions involve the generalized Airy functions for specific values only. The analysis demonstrates the validity of the approximations for the asymptotic suction boundary layer profile and provides insights into the behavior of the solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
