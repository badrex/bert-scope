Analytical solutions for the mass transport velocity inside the boundary layer adjacent to the elastic seabed and in the core region of the water column are obtained. The mass transport velocity above a soft elastic bed could be twice that over a rigid bed in shallow water. The effects of bed deformations on the mass transport velocity induced by surface water wave motions are examined.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
