The deposition and preservation of mud drapes on sand waves are influenced by factors such as sand-wave asymmetry, bottom concentration of suspended mud, time-velocity asymmetry, and tidal current strength. The research provides insights into the depositional cycles and tidal regimes of the early Cretaceous period.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Sedimentology"}
