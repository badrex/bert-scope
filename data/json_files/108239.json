He compares the phenomenon to the formation of hoar-frost and dew on land, explaining that the main difference is the presence of water above the ice. Farquharson also addresses objections to his explanation and provides further evidence for his theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
