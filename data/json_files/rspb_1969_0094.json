The use of prostaglandin E1 prevents platelet aggregation, improving the perfusion and increasing transmitter overflow from the spleen. This discovery helps maintain a full and uniform circulation throughout the spleen, enhancing the study of adrenergic transmission processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
