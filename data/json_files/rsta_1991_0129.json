It explores the behavior of large-scale systems, such as gas molecules and road traffic networks, and how simple local rules can lead to coherent and purposeful behavior at the macroscopic level. The article also describes the development of a routing scheme called Dynamic Alternative Routing for telephone networks, which aims to optimize performance criteria and respond to failures and overloads.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Communication Networks"}
