They find that during saturation, a shock is formed, and the heat released by adsorption moves ahead as a kinematic temperature wave. This work provides a complete description of the non-isothermal behavior of a single adsorbate in fixed bed processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
