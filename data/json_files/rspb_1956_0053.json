They discovered that the most effective method of resuscitation was using diathermy, which allowed for a higher rate of recovery and survival. The duration of suspended animation and progressive freezing influenced the course of revival and the proportion of animals that recovered completely. Hamsters that supercooled to temperatures as low as -5\u00b0C revived fully and lived for weeks or months, while those that crystallized spontaneously after supercooling to temperatures below -3.5\u00b0C had a lower chance of recovery and survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
