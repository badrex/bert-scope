They find that the presence of acetylene in the flame is responsible for the luminosity, as it decomposes into carbon and hydrogen under heat, creating incandescent carbon particles. The research also shows that excessive dilution of acetylene with inert gases destroys luminosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion"}
