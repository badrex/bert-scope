It reviews three studies of cell lineage mutants, focusing on mutations affecting vulval cell lineages and the analysis of control genes lin-12 and lin-14. The study also highlights the logical features of the genetic program, such as control genes and developmental subprogrammes, and the organization of the lineage into a hierarchy of binary decisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
