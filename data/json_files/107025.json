He conducted experiments and made observations on the growth, size, and habits of elephants, including the methods used to capture them. Corse discovered that elephants grow at different rates and that females tend to grow slower than males. He also found that elephants can be captured and tamed, contradicting the belief that once an elephant escapes captivity, it cannot be trapped again.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Biology"}
