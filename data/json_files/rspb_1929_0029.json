The authors found that dark adaptation lowers the fusion frequency, and that this effect can be observed in both foveal and peripheral observations. The results provide insight into the physiological factors affecting the critical frequency and contribute to the understanding of visual perception and adaptation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Perception"}
