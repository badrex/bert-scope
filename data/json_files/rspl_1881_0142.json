They observed that the boundary surfaces of contact become indefinite when the current passes from a lighter to a heavier solution and become sharply defined when the current leaves the heavier and re-enters the lighter liquid. The author also mentions that reversing the direction of the current several times can reverse these effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
