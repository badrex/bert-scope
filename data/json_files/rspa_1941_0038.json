They focus on determining the average pressure and streamlines, which are essential for understanding the flow and pressures induced by the percolation. This method provides accurate results and can be applied to various cases, including those with different strata and anisotropic soils.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
