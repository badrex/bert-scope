Sponge-specific bacterial strains were isolated from various sponge species and regions, and their antigens were analyzed. The findings indicate that these strains share common ancestors and have widespread geographical and taxonomic distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
