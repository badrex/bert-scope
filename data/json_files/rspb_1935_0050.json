The researchers found that younger birds had a wider range of responses to oestrone injections, while mature birds showed a more consistent reaction. The study highlights the importance of considering individual factors, such as age, when interpreting the results of oestrone-induced plumage changes in capons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Poultry Science"}
