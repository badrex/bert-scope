They derive correction factors to calculate surface tension and spreading coefficients from sessile drop heights, showing that all sessile drops possess a maximum height at an intermediate size. This research provides a better understanding of the behavior of sessile drops and helps in accurately measuring surface properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
