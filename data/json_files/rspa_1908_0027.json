They used a horizontal disc oscillating in a liquid and measured the decay of amplitude to calculate the viscosity. This method was suitable for liquids with viscosities not more than 100 times that of water and could be used for temperatures up to a white heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
