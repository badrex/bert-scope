It discovers that the smooth muscle has a unique 'catch mechanism' that allows it to contract slowly and maintain the contraction with little energy expenditure. The research also reveals that the proteins associated with contraction in lamellibranch muscles include a conventional actomyosin and myosin in addition to tropomyosin A (TMA), which was previously thought to replace the classical contractile proteins in these muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Contraction"}
