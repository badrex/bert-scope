The authors found that the density of protein crystals can be altered by about 3% by changing the composition of the medium. They also discovered that it is crucial to specify the medium used in experiments, as it can affect the results. The findings contribute to a better understanding of protein structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
