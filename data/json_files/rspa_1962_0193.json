The study establishes expressions for the relation between the rate of dilatancy and the maximum stress ratio for any ideal packing and provides insights into the behavior of particulate materials like sands, clays, sugar, and asphalt.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Geotechnical Engineering"}
