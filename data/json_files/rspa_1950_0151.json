They found that chloropicrin significantly lowers the ignition boundary, suggesting that it sensitizes the reaction by providing chlorine atoms that initiate the reaction chains. The study also shows that nitrosyl chloride, another product of chloropicrin decomposition, inhibits the sensitized ignitions. This research supports the idea that chloropicrin can affect the hydrogen-chlorine reaction through a fragment of a molecule other than the reactants.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
