The author compares the results with other stations worldwide, highlighting the relatively low variability in the British climate. The study also investigates the frequency of sudden temperature changes and their magnitudes, finding that sudden rises in temperature are more frequent and of greater amount than sudden falls.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Meteorology"}
