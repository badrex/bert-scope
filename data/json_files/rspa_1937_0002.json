The authors develop a theoretical model to determine the relationship between the anode and grid potentials and the primary and secondary anode currents in the condition of space-charge limitation. The study provides insights into the behavior of secondary electrons and helps improve the understanding of vacuum electronics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electronics and Electrical Engineering"}
