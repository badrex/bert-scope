He suggests that the gland serves two purposes: first, it helps in blood circulation by receiving blood from other parts of the body, especially during respiration. Second, it acts as a reservoir for bone formation during early growth stages. This study provides insight into the thymus gland's role in the body's physiological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
