The research explores how these species interact and survive in a shared environment containing wheat. The findings show that competition mainly occurs among larvae, leading to increased mortality in the immature stages. The Verhulst-Pearl logistic equation and the Lotka-Volterra simultaneous equations are used to model the growth of populations and predict the outcome of competition. The results indicate that species can coexist only if they occupy different ecological niches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
