They discovered that both longitudinal and transverse divisions occur in these spirochetes, and the direction of division is influenced by the number of spirochetes present in the blood. The authors argue that the protozoal characteristics of spirochetes are more prominent than their bacterial characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
