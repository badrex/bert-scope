They improved upon previous methods by achieving a higher degree of steadiness in conditions and reducing heat losses. Their results provide a more accurate value for the mechanical equivalent of heat, which can be compared to the electrical equivalent of heat. This research contributes to the understanding of fundamental constants in physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
