The findings suggest a complex, multihormonal control of moulting in crustaceans, with both hormones showing specific binding to Y-organ receptors. This research strengthens the role of these hormones in moult control and their physiological significance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroendocrinology"}
