The authors derive critical equations for the sails and present a matrix formulation to solve the eigenvalue problem. The results confirm expectations regarding sail behavior and can be useful for the theoretically-minded sailor.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
