They find that the five- and six-membered rings in these complexes have similar properties, and that the ring conformation significantly influences the rotational strength. The study provides insights into the relationship between molecular structure and optical activity in these complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Coordination Compounds"}
