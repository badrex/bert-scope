Joliot worked with his wife, Irene Curie, on various research projects, including the study of thin films, the electrochemistry of radioactive elements, and the nature of soft rays accompanying alpha-ray emission. Their most notable discovery was the identification of the neutron, which they inadvertently proved through their experiments involving the bombardment of beryllium with alpha particles. Joliot's work laid the foundation for further research in nuclear structure and the development of nuclear technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
