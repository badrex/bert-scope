They built an apparatus with a wire suspended in an air chamber and measured the damping of vibrations to calculate the coefficient of viscosity. The results were compared with previous findings, highlighting the importance of controlling factors like temperature and pressure in these experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas dynamics"}
