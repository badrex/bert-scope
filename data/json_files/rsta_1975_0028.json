The authors propose a new term to be incorporated into the expression for the difference in Gibbs free energy between the superconducting and normal states, which gives rise to a transition from the normal state to a superconducting state with a finite value of at a point called the hypo-critical point. This point occurs at a lower field than the Landau critical point and has implications for understanding the behavior of superconductors in various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
