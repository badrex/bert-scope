They identify two classes of exact solutions in magnetohydrodynamics, one with constant magnetic fields and another with spatially varying magnetic fields. The study provides insight into the behavior of vortical disturbances and their growth in magnetohydrodynamic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
