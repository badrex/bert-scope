The authors found that fat begins to accumulate in the lutein cells after a certain period of growth and functional activity. The outer parts of the corpus luteum have less efficient vascularization, which may be due to developmental conditions. The study provides insights into the complex fat and lipoid changes in the corpus luteum during the oestrous cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
