Both in-plane and out-of-plane motion is considered, and the analysis focuses on the symmetric in-plane modes, which are heavily dependent on a parameter accounting for cable geometry and elasticity. The theory is validated through simple experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
