This approach avoids the limitations of Fick's diffusion equation and provides a more accurate representation of the spreading of particles in eddy-motion. The method is demonstrated through the analysis of atmospheric and oceanic observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
