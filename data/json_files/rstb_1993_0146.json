The development of efficient insertional mutagenesis systems and a physical map has facilitated the cloning of numerous plant genes, leading to a better understanding of processes such as flowering, environmental responses, and plant-pathogen interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
