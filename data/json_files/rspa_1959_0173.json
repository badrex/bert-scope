They develop a method to analyze the elastic field outside an ellipsoidal inclusion, which can be used to study the deformation of materials and the behavior of stress in the presence of inhomogeneities. The solution is particularly useful for understanding the mechanical properties of materials and their applications in engineering and material science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
