The researchers found that the male gametangia of Allomyces contain a brilliant orange pigment, which is not present in the female gametangia or asexual plants. The carotenoids play a role in the sexual maturation and fertilization processes of the fungus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fungal Biology"}
