The model suggests that the fibril is a stack of layers with molecules parallel to the axis in the overlap region and tilted in the gap region. This theory explains the low-angle X-ray diffraction patterns observed in tendons and provides insights into the molecular structure of collagen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
