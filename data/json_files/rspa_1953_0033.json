The authors extend the method to include resonance degeneracy and transitions involving a change in the axial component of angular momentum. They also compare the method with Born's approximation and discuss its scope and limitations. The article provides new semi-classical formulae suitable for numerical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
