They describe the fungus's life cycle, including the formation of resting sporangia, the germination of zoospores, and the infection of young potato plant tissue. The authors also discuss the morphology and cytology of the organism, providing insights into its classification and behavior within the host plant.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
