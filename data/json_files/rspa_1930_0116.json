They demonstrate that the incorrect boundary conditions assumed by classical hydrodynamics lead to discrepancies between theoretical predictions and real fluid behavior. The study concludes that the only possible motion is one where the solid and the containing vessel move with a single velocity of translation, and no solid can rotate. This result highlights the importance of considering viscosity terms in the equations of motion to satisfy the correct boundary conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
