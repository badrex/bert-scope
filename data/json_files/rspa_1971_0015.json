The research finds that adding a small amount of electrical power to a subsidiary stream of gases through a magnetically rotated plasma jet can significantly increase flame throughput. The most effective carrier gas for this process is nitrogen, which produces large increases in throughput and improves flame stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
