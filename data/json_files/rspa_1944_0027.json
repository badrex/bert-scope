They demonstrate this method for electromagnetic and meson fields, showing that the modified tensor leads to a finite integral of energy and momentum over any space-like surface. This approach helps avoid spurious infinities and provides a finite total energy and momentum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
