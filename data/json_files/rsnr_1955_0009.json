This groundbreaking discovery has been compared to Harvey's discovery of the circulation of the blood. Despite a contentious debate over who should be credited with the discovery, Bell's work on the nervous system, including his 1811 pamphlet \"Idea of a New Anatomy of the Brain,\" laid the foundation for future research in neurology and nerve physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurology"}
