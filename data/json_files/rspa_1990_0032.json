They demonstrate that some separable systems for the Dirac equation in curved space-time cannot be explained by Miller's theory of factorizable systems. They also provide a tensorial characterization of a class of second-order operators that commute with the Dirac operator, relating the existence of higher-order symmetry operators to the geometrical properties of the background metric.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
