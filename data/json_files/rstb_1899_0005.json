This bacterium can be isolated from other bacteria and molds by heating the soil and using acid media. The bacterium's growth varies on different culture media, and its gelatinous sheath gradually disappears with repeated transfers or aging cultures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
