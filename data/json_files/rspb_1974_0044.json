They found that HDL3 has a particle of radius of gyration 5.5 nm, with a central low electron density (lipid) core and an outer electron dense polar annulus. This research helps to understand the organization and interactions of lipid and protein constituents in lipoproteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
