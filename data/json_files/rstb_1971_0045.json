The author explains the use of bright- and dark-field microscopy techniques and the importance of thin carbon support films for imaging unstained biological macromolecules. The methods are demonstrated through various examples, including DNA-protein monolayers and ferritin molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
