They demonstrated that locusts could learn to change the frequency of discharge of a tonic motoneurone, showing that plasticity of tonic motoneurones may be a widespread phenomenon. This preparation can serve as a model system for cellular learning studies, with both up-learning and down-learning occurring and being reversible.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
