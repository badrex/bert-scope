They discovered the arrangement of nerve fibers, the presence of nerve vesicles, and the differences in the grey substance's structure. The study provides a detailed understanding of the spinal chord's intricate and delicate structure, contributing to the knowledge of the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
