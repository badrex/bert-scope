The author examines various theories and suggests that a rotatory gale and the interaction of warm and cold air masses may be responsible for these temperature changes. The author also notes that these fluctuations are common in the Arctic regions and can lead to heavy rains and snowstorms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
