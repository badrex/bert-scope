It shows that the process of protein synthesis plays a significant role in the molecular mechanism responsible for the decrease in total protein content following denervation. The research also reveals that the program of gene expression operating in the muscle fiber during its active synaptic interaction with the motoneuron is preserved after the interaction is interrupted.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
