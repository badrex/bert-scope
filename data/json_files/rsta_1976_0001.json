The authors develop a statistical thermodynamics formulation that accounts for realistic polymer molecules experiencing forces and entanglements, as well as crosslinked points that do not deform affinely with the solid. The new model can reproduce classical results under different assumptions and includes the effects of excluded volume and entanglements, leading to more complex expressions for the free energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
