They develop a model using a regular octahedron to represent the possible magnetization states and derive rules for domain shapes and volumes. The findings help in understanding the hierarchy of domains in (112)-orientation plates and provide insights into the magnetization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
