It introduces -functors, which are used to construct resolutions and derive functors. The article also explores the relations between derived functors and the construction of relative homological algebras using ideals in the ring of endomorphisms or pairs of adjoint functors. The concepts are applied to group theory, spectral sequences, and sheaf theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Category Theory"}
