The author analyzes family measurements and correlation coefficients to investigate the existence of a steady telegonic influence in humans. While the data is not ideal, it provides some insight into the relationship between heredity and telegony in human stature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
