The method involves expanding the wave function in terms of a small parameter and obtaining ordinary differential equations for the approximating functions. The first-order expansion is used to derive equations for the slow variation of amplitude, wavenumber, and other parameters in a nearly uniform wavetrain. The method is compared with the averaged Lagrangian method and applied to a simple example and a more general variational problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
