They use generalized Airy functions to represent the solution of the wave equation in the case of reflection of a spherical wave from a plane boundary. This expansion is valid in a region including a critical ray, allowing for a more accurate understanding of wave behavior near the critical ray and in the shadow zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave Propagation"}
