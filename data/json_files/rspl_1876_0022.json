They compare the ossicles in humans, apes, and monkeys, highlighting the differences and similarities in their anatomy. The study aims to demonstrate how the characteristics of these bones can help classify and understand the evolutionary relationships between different mammalian species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Osteology"}
