A. Gebbie, W. J. Burroughs, and G. R. Bird confirmed the identification of the magnetic dipole rotation spectrum of oxygen in atmospheric studies through laboratory measurements. They compared the laboratory observations with theoretical predictions, finding agreement in frequencies and integrated line-strengths within experimental error. The study provides a better understanding of oxygen's magnetic dipole transitions and their impact on atmospheric absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
