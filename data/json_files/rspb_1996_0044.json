The main determinant of mechanical properties was found to be the mineral content. The ratio of Young's modulus to shear modulus was approximately 20:1, indicating the importance of controlled crack propagation in protecting hollow bones from failure due to local impact.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
