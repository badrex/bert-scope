They find that actin filaments have a specific structure that matches the axial periodicity in the I-substance of vertebrate striated muscle. This discovery helps to understand the location of actin filaments in the contractile apparatus of various muscles and contributes to the study of muscular contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
