They used a magnetic spectrograph to measure the momentum of 1010 particles and compared the underground spectrum with the ground-level spectrum to determine the energy loss of fast mesons in penetrating the rock. The results showed that the energy loss for mesons in the momentum range of 7 to 15 is as expected by theory, with the collision process being responsible for most of the loss.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
