This method eliminates the effect of phase distribution on the comparison, allowing for a more accurate assessment of intrinsic toxicity. The toxic indices determined by this method for a single organism fall within a relatively narrow range, while the measured toxic concentrations can vary widely between substances. This method is particularly useful for comparing substances within homologous series, where toxic concentrations often decrease logarithmically as the series is ascended.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Toxicology"}
