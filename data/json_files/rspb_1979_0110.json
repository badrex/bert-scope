The eye consists of approximately 260 ommatidia and is adapted to function optimally under low light and stable temperature conditions. The eye's structure and function are compared in dark-adapted and light-adapted animals, as well as in animals exposed to heat stress. The results show that light and temperature cause separate but intricately related effects on the eye, which must be studied together for a better understanding of their impact on the organism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Invertebrate Zoology"}
