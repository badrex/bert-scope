It highlights the importance of balanced combinations of genes and the resistance to change under selection. The author also explores the advantages of heterozygotes in fertility and stability, as well as the effects of polygenic mutation on natural populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
