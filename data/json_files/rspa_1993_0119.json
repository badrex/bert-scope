The study focuses on two-dimensional and three-dimensional transient wave propagation problems and provides explicit general solutions for displacements and stresses. The solutions can be applied to various disciplines such as seismology, earthquake engineering, and geomechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
