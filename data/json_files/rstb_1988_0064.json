The authors find that increasing the number of genotypes can lead to complex cycles and chaotic behavior, and that intermediate recombination rates may promote the accumulation of genetic variation involved in host-parasite interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
