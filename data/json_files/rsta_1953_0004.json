They develop a more complete treatment of electron exchange for continuous states, which is essential for understanding processes like electron excitation and deactivation in astrophysical phenomena such as auroras, nebulae, novae, and the solar corona.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
