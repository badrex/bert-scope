The authors find that the reaction involves the double bond and is influenced by factors such as pressure, substrate, and the presence of inhibitors. The oxidation process is accompanied by an increase in the film's area and the vertical component of the effective dipole moment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
