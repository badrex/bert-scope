Abney, presents a detailed map of the solar spectrum between wavelengths 7150 and 10,000, using photographs taken with diffraction gratings. The author discusses improvements in the photographic process and the development of sensitive gelatine emulsion plates, which allowed for more accurate mapping of the solar spectrum. The author also describes various gratings and mounting techniques used for the experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
