The molecule has a planar structure with a three-fold axis of symmetry, and the two molecules in the unit cell are arranged in layers. The crystal structure provides evidence for a layer structure, which is supported by the perfect basal cleavage and the optical and magnetic properties of the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Chemistry"}
