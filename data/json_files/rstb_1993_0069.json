These domains help in the activation of biochemical signaling pathways in cells stimulated with growth factors. The study also highlights the mechanism by which tyrosine kinases activate SH2-containing proteins and couple to Ras, a crucial signaling pathway for cell growth and differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
