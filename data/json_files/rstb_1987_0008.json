The research combines geomorphology, stratigraphy, palaeobotanical, and palaeo-entomological analysis to understand the impact of climate change and falling sea levels. The findings reveal that the climate cooled from temperate to arctic, and the flora and fauna experienced significant modifications during this period. The research provides insights into the environmental changes that took place between 121,000 and 45,000 years ago, which can be compared to similar changes in France and Britain.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
