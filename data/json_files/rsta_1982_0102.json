The experimental spectrum is found to be approximately that of a 3 K black body, with a peak at 180 GHz. The article highlights the difficulties in accurately measuring the spectrum, including unwanted signals from the apparatus and the sky, and the need for high-frequency measurements to be done from higher sites like aircraft, balloons, rockets, or satellites. The importance of atmospheric corrections and the potential of space satellites for future high-frequency measurements is also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
