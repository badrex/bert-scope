The results showed that nitrogenous materials can be calorific and maintain body temperature alone, while non-nitrogenous substances can also be calorific without forming tissue. A diet with a high proportion of nitrogenous food can sustain life, health, and normal temperature, even if other food sources are abundant. The experiments also demonstrated that weight loss and strength variations depend on the type of diet, but body temperature remains stable.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nutrition and Metabolism"}
