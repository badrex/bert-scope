They discovered that the excitation range lies between 2340 \u00c5 and 1760 \u00c5, with the most effective light being around 1942 \u00c5. The fluorescence spectrum can be obtained from iodine vapour over a wide range of temperatures, and it is not necessary for the exciting light to be of a single wavelength. The author also found that fluorescence can be excited by light from various metal sparks, such as aluminum, zinc, cadmium, and magnesium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
