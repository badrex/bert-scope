It explores the interaction between the laser and the plasma, heat transport in the corona, and the modification of laser light transmission due to plasma density gradients. The author also considers the steepening of density profiles and the potential for plasma instabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
