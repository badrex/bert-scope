They found that the variation in pure metals, particularly sodium, is very small and does not conform to the ideal quasi-free-electron model of a metal. The experiments on copper alloys, however, are well interpreted in terms of magneto-resistive behavior, showing that the anomalous scattering in copper and its alloys is not significantly affected by a magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
