They analyze the Red Sea's topography, magnetic anomalies, and the axial trough, which resembles mid-ocean ridge rift valleys. The study supports the theory of seafloor spreading and continental drift, providing insights into the Red Sea's formation and the surrounding regions' geological history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
