They found that the linear part of the change of resistance is independent of the orientation of the crystal in the field and is similar to the phenomenon observed in bismuth. The research aimed to survey the phenomenon of resistance over the whole of the elements of the periodic system, accumulating a large number of metals. The authors emphasized the importance of ensuring the purity of the metals used in the experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
