They use Fermi-Dirac statistics to describe the distribution of electrons in a conductor and predict that the intensity of the scattered radiation follows an exponential distribution. The theory also suggests that temperature and magnetic fields have no influence on Compton scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
