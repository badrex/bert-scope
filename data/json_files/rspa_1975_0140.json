They analyze the experiment's optical system and demonstrate how the longitudinal entrainment of the side lobes of the index system's diffraction pattern leads to a transverse shift due to dispersion. The author also calculates the effective phase shift and lateral shift in the grating image, resulting in a dispersion term in the formula for lateral shift.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
