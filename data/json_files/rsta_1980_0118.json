Researchers found that factors such as size, thickness, and chemical composition, including elements like Al, Mn, and Si, influence these properties. They also discovered that plates with remelted inclusions had through-thickness properties independent of plate thickness, while normal plates showed a decrease in properties with decreasing thickness. No signs of microstructural instability were observed during long-term creep tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
