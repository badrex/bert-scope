Despite facing difficulties with the vacuum apparatus and leaking receivers, Basevi successfully conducted observations at multiple stations. The collected data will be used to determine temperature and pressure corrections, and further observations at higher altitudes are planned. The final results are expected by September.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
