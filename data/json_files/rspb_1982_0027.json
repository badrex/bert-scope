The researchers found that a stylar fluid containing proteins inhibits pollen tube growth when using protein fractions from'self' styles. They also discuss the potential ways these glycoproteins could control pollen tube elongation and compare their findings to other self-incompatibility systems in angiosperms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
