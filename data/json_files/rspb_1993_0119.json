The researchers found that sheep with lower parasite burdens had a higher chance of survival during population crashes. They also discovered that individuals with different genotypes at the adenosine deaminase locus had varying levels of parasite resistance, suggesting that parasite-associated selection may be maintaining genetic variation in the population.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
