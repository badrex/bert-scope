The author discusses experiments where pigeons were trained to identify trees in various photographs and found that they could learn and generalize the category of trees even when the stimuli were constantly changing. The findings challenge traditional theories of reinforcement and suggest that pigeons may have unique cognitive abilities for natural categorization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
