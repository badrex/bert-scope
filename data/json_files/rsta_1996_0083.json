It shows that the view bifurcation set of a piecewise smooth surface has positive codimension, ensuring that the view graph is well-defined. The article also provides an upper bound for the number of nodes in the view graph and presents an exact symbolic algorithm to compute the view graphs of piecewise smooth algebraic surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Computational Geometry"}
