He suggests that the deluge was caused by a change in the Earth's center of gravity and the release of waters from the heavens and the Earth. This theory also explains the presence of marine fossils found far from the sea and the formation of the Earth's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
