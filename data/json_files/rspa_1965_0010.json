The author extends the approach to a wider class of fluids, considering their response to stress at any instant, which may depend on previous rheological history. The study provides conditions that must be satisfied for certain simple flow patterns to be attainable without the imposition of artificial body-force fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
