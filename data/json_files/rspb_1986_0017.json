The results suggest that the radiation of Partula in the Society Islands can be explained by a single colonization of each island. The average rate of allozymic divergence is estimated to be 0.126 per million years, with a threefold variation in rates within Partula. The findings challenge the idea that geographical isolation and multiple colonizations play significant roles in the radiation of other animals in archipelagos.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
