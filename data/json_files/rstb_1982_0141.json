The researchers found that the passive pathway in toad skin exhibits current rectification, with a larger conductance for outward currents. They also discovered that the time response of the current to applied potential steps revealed a time-dependent conductance increase, similar to voltage-gated cation channels in excitable membranes. The study provides insight into the mechanisms of chloride transport through the chloride-conductive pathway in toad skin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
