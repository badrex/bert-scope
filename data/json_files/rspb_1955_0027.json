The research shows that oxygen poisoning inhibits respiration, creates a block in the tricarboxylic acid cycle, and alters the ascorbic acid and glutathione oxidation-reduction systems. These findings contribute to the understanding of the various metabolic phenomena observed in both plant and animal tissues under the term \"oxygen poisoning.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
