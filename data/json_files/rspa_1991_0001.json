They demonstrate that the dimensionless temperature problem is similar to the dimensionless streamwise velocity problem for Prandtl and Schmidt numbers of unity. This analogy allows for conclusions about local and spanwise-averaged surface heat transfer rates and iso-concentration profiles, providing insight into the relationship between concentration and momentum problems in nonlinear Gortler vortex flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
