They analyze the wave's shape, internal velocities, pressures, and streamlines, and demonstrate the relationship between the surface profile and the decay amplitude of internal streamlines. This study improves the understanding of solitary waves and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics > Fluid Dynamics"}
