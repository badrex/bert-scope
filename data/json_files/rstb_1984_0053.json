They compare their theory with Rayner's vortex theory and find that under identical test conditions, the numerical results agree to within 3%. The theory provides a method to calculate mean lift and induced power for unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms, but it is not yet complete, as it does not include the effects of leading edge vortex shedding during the wingbeat.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
