The authors use a combination of Stark-modulation and pulsed-nozzle, Fourier-transform microwave spectroscopies to analyze the complex vibrational satellite series in the hydrogen cyanide dimer's spectrum. They find that the vibrational satellite pattern is dominated by progressions in the hydrogen-bond stretching mode and the hydrogen-bond bending modes. The study provides insights into the hydrogen-bond potential functions and electrical changes that accompany dimer formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
