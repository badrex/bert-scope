The model uses a combination of assumptions and learning algorithms to determine the principal curvatures and their orientations, allowing for the identification of surface shapes such as convex, concave, and saddle-shaped. This research contributes to the understanding of how the visual system processes and interprets surface information.", "scientific_discipline": "Computer Science > Computer Vision"}
