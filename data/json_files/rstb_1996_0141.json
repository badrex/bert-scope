The research found that factors such as body size, abundance, foraging behavior, and reproductive success influenced the relative predation risk for different bird species. Sparrowhawks showed a preference for forest birds in April, while later in the breeding season, they targeted more abundant or easier-to-catch species like house sparrows and greenfinches. The study highlights the importance of understanding the complex factors that contribute to predation risk in bird populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
