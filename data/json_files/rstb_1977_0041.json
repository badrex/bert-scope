They present evidence supporting the conclusion that optic nerve fiber terminal arborizations can be continuously modified and capable of large-scale movement across the optic tectum. The study also examines the contributions of neural specificity and other ordering mechanisms in the coordinated development of the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
