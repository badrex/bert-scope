They also measured the body temperature of elderly individuals and found that despite common beliefs, elderly people can maintain a normal body temperature. The author suggests that in very old age or early infancy, the body's ability to resist cold is weak, and body temperature can be easily affected by external factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Thermoregulation"}
