They investigated the role of moisture in promoting the heterogeneous catalytic combustion of carbonic oxide with oxygen and the structure of the surface as revealed by its catalytic activity and electrical condition. The results showed that the reaction velocity was higher in the presence of steam, and the rates of reaction in the moist and dry systems converged at higher temperatures."}
