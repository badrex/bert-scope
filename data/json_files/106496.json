The experiment involves immersing the thermometer in a freezing mixture and observing the contraction of mercury as it freezes. The results show that mercury contracts in the act of freezing, and the author provides a method for accurately measuring the freezing point of mercury using thermometers with wooden and ivory scales.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
