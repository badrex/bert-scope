In contracted fibers, thick and thin filaments are intermingled randomly, while in relaxed fibers, actin filaments are clearly ordered into bundles. The author proposes a contraction model where the contractile apparatus of smooth muscles is composed of small contraction units of inter-digitating bundles of thick and thin filaments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
