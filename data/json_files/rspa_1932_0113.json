They discovered that nitrogen nuclei can be disintegrated by the incident radiation, providing evidence for the neutron nature of the radiation. This finding supports the hypothesis that artificial disintegration can occur through neutron interactions, leading to the expulsion of particles such as protons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
