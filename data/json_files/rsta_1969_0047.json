The authors found that eliminating the high-frequency band of turbulence measurements distinguishes stable categories from neutral ones. The results have implications for calculating the dispersion of pollution from chimneys in urban areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Climatology"}
