The authors examine the effects of pressure, surface tension, viscosity, and density on the stability and disintegration of liquid sheets, and discuss the role of turbulence and suspensions in the liquid. They also explore the use of different types of spray nozzles and the potential for controlling drop size through a better understanding of these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
