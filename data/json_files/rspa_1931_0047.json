They discovered that pure, dry solvents tended to give smaller reaction rates, and that the presence of impurities in non-polar solvents could significantly influence the reaction rate. The decomposition reaction was found to be catalyzed by both acids and bases, with organic bases showing moderate catalytic effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
