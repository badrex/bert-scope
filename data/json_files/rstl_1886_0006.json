They find that enterochlorophyll in animals and plant chlorophyll share similar spectra, suggesting a possible connection between their origins. The study also reveals differences between animal and plant pigments, as well as the presence of other pigments like haemoglobin and lutein.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant and Animal Pigments"}
