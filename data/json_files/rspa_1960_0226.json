They found that lead tetraethyl significantly increases the auto-ignition delay in explosions of oxygen with heptane or iso-octane, using various sensitizers. The results showed that the effect of TEL on the induction periods of explosive combustions is not a special feature of the acetylene-oxygen explosions sensitized by amyl nitrite, and that other hydrocarbons and sensitizers respond to the antiknock in a similar way. The actual magnitude of the effect of TEL varies with the fuel and with the conditions of ignition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
