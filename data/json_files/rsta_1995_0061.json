They focus on solutions that can be obtained through equivariant Hopf bifurcation from a group-invariant equilibrium. The study includes the classification of steady-state, spatially periodic solutions of Euclidean-equivariant PDEs in two and three space dimensions, which guarantees the existence of these solutions by the equivariant branching lemma. The authors find new solution branches for each of the countable infinity of twelve-dimensional and eight-dimensional irreducible representations of the Euclidean group, and present pictures of representative solutions as they might appear in shadowgraph images of thermal convection patterns in hydrodynamic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
