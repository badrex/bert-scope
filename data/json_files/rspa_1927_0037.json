They found that the crystals are truly orthorhombic, and the optical anomalies can be explained by a slight difference in orientation of successively crystallized layers. The presence of alkali halides in the mother liquor may have caused strained lamellar growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
