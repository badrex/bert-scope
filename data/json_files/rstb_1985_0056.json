Researchers recorded potentials evoked by nerve stimulation and found that the ipsilateral potential (PI6) is a near-field potential with intraspinal generators. The study also suggests that the contralateral potential (P16) may be a complex potential arising from multiple generators, including the dorsal column system.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pain Management and Neurophysiology"}
