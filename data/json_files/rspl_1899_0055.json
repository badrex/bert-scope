The research reveals that the collector's formation is due to the migration of the fin rostrally, providing evidence against the excalation theory. The findings support the migration theory and contribute to understanding the development of the nervous system in Mustelus species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
