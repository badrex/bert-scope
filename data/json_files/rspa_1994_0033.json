The authors analyze the natural mapping between the -curve analysis plane and the R6-O3 failure assessment diagram, and demonstrate how to derive implied -curves and implied applied curves from a single failure assessment line. The article also examines the consistency and conservatism of analyses of ductile tearing instability using a single failure assessment line.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
