The author discusses various processes, such as radiative and non-radiative attachment, molecular dissociation, and resonance processes. The study focuses on the formation of mercury negative ions at a nickel surface, providing a detailed calculation of the probability of these processes occurring.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Science"}
