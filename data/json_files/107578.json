The bones were discovered in solid limestone rock and were in an excellent state of preservation. The author compares the fossilized bones with a known skeleton of a Rhinoceros to determine their size and species. The analysis of the bones showed that they belonged to Rhinoceroses of nearly the same size, except for a few smaller bones. The author also mentions the analysis of the bones' composition, which was found to be very earthy and free of extraneous matters.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
