These findings challenge the traditional boundary between Sporophyta and Archegoniata. The author proposes a new genus, Lepidocarpon, to classify these fossils, characterized by a single functional megaspore in each megasporangium and a closed, seed-like reproductive body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
