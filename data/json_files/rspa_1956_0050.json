It presents a mathematical analysis of the flow through porous surfaces, such as wire gauze, and provides solutions for various cases, including flow through a wedge, cylinder, or cone. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the properties of porous sheets and their resistance laws in fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
