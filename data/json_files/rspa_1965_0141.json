They found that the degree of dissociation in the equilibrium does not deviate significantly from unity until the molarity is greater than about 10, suggesting that the low value for the dissociation constant obtained by Redlich may be incorrect.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
