The research found that the apparent length of a line varies with its orientation, with vertical lines appearing longer than horizontal lines. The linear density of zero-crossings in Laplacian-of-Gaussian filtered images also shows a similar variation with orientation. This close correspondence suggests that the human visual system's orientation dependence of length judgments is influenced by the environmental structure of real-world scenes.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
