They demonstrate that chaotic dynamics can occur near the unperturbed resonant periodic orbits when double resonance takes place. The chaotic motions result from the transverse intersection of the stable and unstable manifolds of normally hyperbolic invariant tori and are characterized by a generalization of the Bernoulli shift.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
