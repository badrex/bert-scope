The author investigates the chromosome behavior during different stages of nuclear division and provides evidence against the continuous spireme theory. The findings contribute to the understanding of chromosome organization and synapsis in the Odonata group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cytology"}
