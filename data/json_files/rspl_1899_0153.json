The authors investigate the causes of these differences by analyzing the water surface configuration and using instantaneous photography. They also explore the effects of factors such as surface conditions, temperature, and the presence of dust on the splash behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
