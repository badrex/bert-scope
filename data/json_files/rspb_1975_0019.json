They find that plants fall into two incompatible groups and that reciprocal pollinations are alike, suggesting a gametophytic control of the pollen reaction. However, the data is not conclusive, and further research is needed to determine the type of self-incompatibility system in this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Biology"}
