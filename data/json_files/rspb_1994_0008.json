The results showed that queens preferentially ate non-nestmate eggs but did not show a significant preference for nestmate or their own eggs. This suggests that mutual egg-eating within colonies does not affect the stable reproductive skew, and once established, indiscriminate egg-eating could be evolutionarily stable.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
