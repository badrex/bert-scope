They found that the sensory nerve contacts form close connections with the intrafusal muscle fibers, with two distinct types of zones: compact zones at either end and a reticular zone in the center. The study provides insights into the initiation of sensory impulses and the mechanisms of muscular reflex control in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
