He suggests that loess, high-level gravels, and low-level gravels were all formed by floodwaters, providing evidence of the magnitude of these floods and their erosive power. This explanation harmonizes with the hypothesis of greater water volume carried down by rivers in the past.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
