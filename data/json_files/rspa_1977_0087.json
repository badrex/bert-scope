The laser was stabilized using an external absorption cell, and the frequency was measured through a sequence of harmonic-mixing stages involving HCN and other lasers as transfer oscillators. The wavelength measurements and the value of the speed of light are described in a following part. This experiment led to a more accurate value of the speed of light, which has significant implications in electromagnetic, atomic, and relativity theory, as well as practical applications in distance measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Laser Physics"}
