The authors analyze various spectra and yield curves to understand the formation of radicals in DNA and the changes that occur during annealing. They also explore the differences in radical species in different DNA samples and the use of single-crystal studies to better understand the damage caused by radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
