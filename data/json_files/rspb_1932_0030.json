They found that the combination curve of ovalbumin is slightly more variable than that of other proteins, and it has a higher buffering capacity. The study also revealed differences in the buffering power and denaturation of fresh and aged ovalbumin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
