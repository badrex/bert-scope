They found that some fibers from the cercus directly pass through the ganglion, while others synapse with a smaller number of fibers that run forwards in the cord. These giant fibers have large action potentials and run through the next five abdominal ganglia. The study provides insights into the functioning of the invertebrate nervous system and sensory processing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
