They used 1,3-butadiene and 1-butyne as gases and measured the dispersion by analyzing the light absorption of the gas stream. The results showed that the peak mean concentration passes through a maximum value with velocity, which can be explained by considering the relative rates of dispersion by convection, longitudinal molecular diffusion, and radial molecular diffusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
