The research reveals strong seasonal variations in 13C and magnesium contents, which are linked to changes in growth rate. The findings indicate that metabolic effects cannot be ignored in paleo-environmental interpretation of carbonate skeletal chemistry, and stable isotopes are useful tools in understanding overall carbon metabolism of photosynthetic calcifying organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coral Reef Ecology"}
