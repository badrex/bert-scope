They discover that irradiation with ultra-violet light and heating cause the development of color centers, which are accompanied by the decomposition of the salt and the evolution of nitrogen. The coloration is studied spectro-photometrically, and a detailed picture of the photochemical and thermal processes is obtained. The findings provide insights into the relationships between the various absorption bands observed in potassium azide and the corresponding centers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
