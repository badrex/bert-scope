Researchers observed changes in the body, such as increased red blood corpuscles and hemoglobin levels, and the development of mountain sickness. They also studied the capacity for continuous and spasmodic exercise at high altitudes and the ability of the human body to adapt to these conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
