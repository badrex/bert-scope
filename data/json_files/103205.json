The area experienced a gentle motion, and the ground opened up, creating chasms and tumbling down in rolls. The soil composition was a mix of clay and gravel. No evidence of underground water currents or earthquakes was found. The event provides valuable geological observations and insights into landslides and soil composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
