The authors explain how imprinting can provide a coherent explanation for the failure of certain experimental crosses and the prevalence of pseudogamy in apomictic angiosperms. They also discuss the genetic basis of imprinting in endosperm and its implications for understanding the evolution of apomixis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
