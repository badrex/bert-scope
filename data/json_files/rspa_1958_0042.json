The kinetic study shows a natural correspondence between molecular structure and reactivity. The results demonstrate how the rate of abstraction of a constituent hydrogen atom from the hydrocarbon is influenced by bond multiplicity and molecular structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
