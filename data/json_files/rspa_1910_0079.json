The authors found that these mixtures form a continuous series of mixed crystals with a minimum eutectic freezing point. The results provide insights into the behavior of mixtures of substances that form mixed crystals and have implications for understanding phase transitions and crystallography.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
