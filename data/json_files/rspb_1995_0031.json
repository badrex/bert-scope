The research used Sibley and Ahlquist's DNA-DNA hybridization phylogeny to analyze passerines and found that species with stronger mating preferences tended to have more species within their taxa. This supports the idea that sexual selection may increase the rate of reproductive divergence and contribute to taxonomic diversity in these bird species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
