He used a spectroscope with six heavy glass prisms to observe the spectra of elements such as sodium, potassium, calcium, and more. The study revealed that two strong lines of the air-spectrum, one of them a double line, were common to the spectra of oxygen and nitrogen. The research also showed that the strong red line of the air-spectrum was due to the presence of aqueous vapor and coincided with the line of hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
