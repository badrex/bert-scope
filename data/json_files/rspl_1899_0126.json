The author, Leonard Hill, conducted experiments using an autoclave to expose animals to rapid changes in pressure. The results showed that the mechanical congestion theory of caisson disease is not accurate, as the circulation of the blood remained stable during the pressure changes. The study also found that the oxygen tension increased, which could have implications for understanding the effects of high-pressure environments on the human body."}
