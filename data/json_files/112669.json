The experiment shows that binocular vision can detect minute differences in distances of objects, such as the thickness of a card, by using the degree of convergence of the optic axes and the sensation of double images. This discovery highlights the importance of binocular vision in perceiving depth and distance.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
