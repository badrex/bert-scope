It discusses the organization of molecular information, structure-activity relations, and receptor interactions in these peptides. The article also explores the pleiotropic actions of these peptides through different mechanisms, as well as their interactions with artificial membranes and the use of tobacco mosaic virus as a carrier for covalently attached peptide hormones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}
