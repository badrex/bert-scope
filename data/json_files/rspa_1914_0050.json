They discovered that the dust cloud acquires an electric charge, and the sign of the charge depends on the nature of the material used to form the dust cloud. The authors also found that the air surrounding the dust cloud carries an electric charge of the opposite sign. The experiments confirmed that the charges are not due to friction between the dust particles and the surface from which they are blown.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
