They describe various methods of measuring suspended impurities and discuss the limitations of each. The authors' method involves using a high-velocity air jet to collect dust particles on a glass surface, allowing for microscopic examination and instant measurement of impurities. This method provides a more accurate representation of the suspended impurities in the air compared to other methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
