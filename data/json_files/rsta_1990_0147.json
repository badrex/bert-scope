The authors highlight the benefits of this optimization technique, such as speed, computer compatibility, and the ability to minimize interferences. They also provide examples of successful optimizations in inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry (ICP-AES), slurry atomization, hydride generation, and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS).", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
