These types include red rods, green rods, double cones with principal and accessory members, large single cones, and small single cones. The study provides a detailed description of the morphological and cytological characteristics of each photoreceptor type, as well as their interconnections through gap junctions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
