The authors develop general expressions for the equivalent sources of aerodynamic bounding surfaces with adjacent turbulent flow. They discuss the radiated field by source distributions in arbitrary motion and the sound generated by turbulent flow around high-speed aerodynamic surfaces. The study shows that surface effects can be treated unambiguously only at low subsonic speeds, while at high supersonic speeds, the field is dominated by an intensive beaming along the directions of Mach wave emission that lie normal to the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
