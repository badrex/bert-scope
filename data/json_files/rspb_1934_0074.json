They discovered that the initial absorption of lysins is a constant fraction of the initial quantity present, and the absorption varies with different lysins and cell types. This research helps to understand the mechanisms of lysin action and the role of lysins in cell lysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
