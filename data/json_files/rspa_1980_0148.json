They propose that hydrogen molecule collisions with target molecules can cause a population inversion in the ground doublet, potentially resulting in maser emission between the ground doublet sub-levels of interstellar molecules like OH and CH. This study explores the possibility of maser action in conditions where conventional pumping can take place, offering predictions for various interstellar masers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
