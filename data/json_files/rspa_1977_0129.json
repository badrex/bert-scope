This model, known as the nonlinear Maxwell model, accounts for the observed shear behavior in these films and reconciles various hypotheses. Experiments with five different fluids support the proposed equation, which covers a wide range of isothermal behavior, including linear and nonlinear viscous, linear viscoelastic, nonlinear viscoelastic, and elastic/plastic under any strain history.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
