It found a significant positive correlation between repertoire size and the volume of the higher vocal center (HVC) after controlling for brain size and phylogenetic relatedness. The results suggest that sexual selection may have shaped the evolution of song by altering the relevant controlling area of the brain, the higher vocal center.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
