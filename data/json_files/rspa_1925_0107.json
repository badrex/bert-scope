The authors discuss the role of soluble substances in reducing surface tension and the differences between soluble and insoluble films. They also examine the Traube-Langmuir theory and its limitations, suggesting alternative explanations for the behavior of surface films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
