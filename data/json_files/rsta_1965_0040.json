The authors explore the effects of phase transitions on convection, considering various reactions and their parameters. They also discuss the impact of phase transitions on the Earth's density and the potential for seismological mapping of ascending and descending currents in the mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
