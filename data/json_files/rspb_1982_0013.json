The researchers found that the number of bands in Littorina littorea, Patella vulgata, and Nucella lapillus shells corresponded well with the number of low waters the animals experienced. The most reliable method for dating bands without interrupting shell deposition involved removing a thin layer from the shell or keeping the animals in seawater with ample food for 36 hours. This research provides evidence that micro-growth bands in intertidal gastropods are related to tidal events.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Tidal Biology"}
