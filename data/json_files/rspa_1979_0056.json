Using data from the Ariel 5 satellite and a coded mask telescope, they discovered several burst and irregular variable X-ray sources near the galactic center. These findings provide insight into the active processes occurring in the nucleus of our galaxy and contribute to the understanding of X-ray astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > X-ray Astronomy"}
