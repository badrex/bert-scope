The author explains how the electrons in the metal combine the properties of free and bound electrons, and how the metal has an infinite conductivity for constant fields. The article also discusses the resonance frequencies and their corresponding -values, and how the absorption bands and spectral lines are affected by these properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
