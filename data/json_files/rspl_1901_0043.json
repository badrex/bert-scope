The authors present a formula to express the rate of heat dissipation and discuss the influence of experimental conditions, such as gas temperature and radiator dimensions. They also explore the practical implications of their findings for modern engineering problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
