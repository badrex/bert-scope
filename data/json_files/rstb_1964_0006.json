They describe the cranial anatomy of these two species, providing new restorations of the occiput, braincase, skull roof, and palate. The research helps to understand the evolution and taxonomy of these ancient amphibians.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
