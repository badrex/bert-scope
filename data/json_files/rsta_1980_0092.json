They found that the surface composition of a copper-silver eutectic alloy changed depending on its pretreatment, with copper enrichment in melting processes and silver enrichment in sawing and polishing. SIMS also detected a wide range of additive and residual elements on the surface of free-machining brass swarf, as well as on the oxide layers of NiCrMoV low alloy steel. This study demonstrates the usefulness of static SIMS in providing information about material properties and solving materials-related problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Surface Analysis"}
