Rutherford and Hans Geiger investigate the charge and nature of the alpha particle using a modified experimental setup. They determine the charge carried by each alpha particle by measuring the total charge expelled per second from a known quantity of radium C. Their findings contribute to the understanding of nuclear physics and radioactivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
