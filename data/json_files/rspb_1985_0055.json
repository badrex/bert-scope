They discovered that four populations of optic nerve fibers project to the colliculus, with synaptic sites located at different depths in the superficial layers. These findings were compared with the distribution of retinocollicular terminals and the morphology of postsynaptic elements in the superficial layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual processing"}
