It identifies two groups of neurons: group A, which is probably sensory, and group B, which is actively neurosecretory. The research also discovers five types of neurosecretory granules and maps their distribution in the insect's abdominal segments. This work provides insights into the complex nervous system of stick insects and their neurosecretory functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurochemistry"}
