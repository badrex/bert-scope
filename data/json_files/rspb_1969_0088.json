The research examines the approximations and assumptions of a previous model and extends the investigation in several directions. The findings show that red blood cells experience much greater resistances than those estimated by the previous model, and the resistance depends nonlinearly on the velocity. The study also discusses the effects of asymmetry and tube porosity on red cell motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
