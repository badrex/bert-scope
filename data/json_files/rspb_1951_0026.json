They found that the full velocity of shortening sets in very early, only about one-tenth of the time to the maximum of an isometric twitch. The delay is not due to inertia but is likely attributed to a statistical distribution of response speeds in individual fibers. This research provides insights into muscle mechanics and muscle activation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
