The author thanks Dr. L. J. Comrie for planning and supervising the calculations, which were carried out using various machines. The results provide encouragement for those who believe in the Riemann Hypothesis, but some features of the table may still be of interest to those who do not.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
