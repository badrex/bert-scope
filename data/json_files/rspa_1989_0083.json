The authors derive algebraic formulae for the energy levels of the ground states of lanthanide ions in a cubic crystalline field and discuss the hyperfine interactions of various ions. They also suggest possible experiments involving magnetic and acoustic resonance and some applications to cryogenics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
