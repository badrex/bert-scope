The author extends the stability analysis of irrotational water waves and finds that certain instabilities are temporarily suppressed at specific wave amplitudes, while a new type of instability appears at higher values. The calculated growth rates are compared with observed rates, providing insights into the behavior of water waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
