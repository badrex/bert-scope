Researchers fed four sponge species with tritium-labeled bacteria and observed that a large proportion of symbiotic bacteria passed through the sponge, while seawater bacteria were retained. The results suggest that sponges may have a mechanism to recognize and reject symbiotic bacteria, possibly due to their capsular sheaths.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
