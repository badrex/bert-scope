Norman Lockyer and F. E. Baxandall, conducted a study on the enhanced lines of titanium, iron, and chromium in the Fraunhoferic spectrum. They compared these lines with solar lines and found that many of the enhanced lines matched with isolated lines in the solar spectrum. This research helped identify the possible origins of solar lines and provided insights into the composition of the sun's chromosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
