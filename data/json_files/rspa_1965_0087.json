The author proposes a hypothesis that fracture initiation is governed by concentrated stress at the crack tip and crack opening displacement. The author also examines the effects of temperature, notch depth, and stress distribution on the fracture behavior of steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
