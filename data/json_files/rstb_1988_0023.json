It discusses the challenges in precisely dating the beginning and end of soil-forming periods and distinguishing climatic factors from other factors such as parent material, relief, and organisms. The author suggests that oceanic oxygen-isotope stages were warmer and wetter than the Holocene, stages 7 and 9 were cooler and drier than, and stages 13-23 were generally warmer and wetter than 1-11.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
