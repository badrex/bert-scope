The authors explain how nitrogen accumulates in the forest and how it is affected by ecological factors and disturbances. They also highlight the importance of understanding nitrogen cycling for forest management and maintaining ecosystem health.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
