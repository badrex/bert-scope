It examines the effects of various gases and vapors on the surfaces and the role of oxide layers in preventing intermetallic contact. The authors also study the Beilby layer, an amorphous layer formed on sliding surfaces, and its impact on the load-carrying capacity of metal bearings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
