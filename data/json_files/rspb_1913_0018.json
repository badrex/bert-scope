They discovered that when muscles contract, hydrogen ions and oxygen tension change, which can affect the surrounding environment. This research could potentially lead to a method for measuring oxygen tensions in tissues directly.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
