The authors present experimental evidence and review previous research on nitrogen assimilation in plants, concluding that the atmosphere may not be a significant source of free nitrogen for plants. They also explore the role of soil minerals, atmospheric deposits, and other factors in plant nitrogen acquisition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Agricultural chemistry"}
