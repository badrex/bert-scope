The patient can identify the orientation of a flickering bar but struggles with orientation identification for edges formed by color contrast, moving stimuli, or flicker contrast. The results suggest that in the absence of striate cortical input, the residual mechanisms for color, flicker, or movement do not efficiently support orientation detection and discrimination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
