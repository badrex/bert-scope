They used a method that involved comparing the ionic velocity with the gas stream velocity in an electric field. The results provided a measure of the relative velocities of the gas and ions, which can be used to determine the velocity of ions in a given electric field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
