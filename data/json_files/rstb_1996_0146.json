The authors argue that despite criticisms, the colonies are distinct populations, and the results show consistent estimates of selection against the medionigra gene. The moth serves as a model for studying gene frequency changes in natural populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
