The parasite causes morphological and behavioral changes in infected mayflies, including sex reversal, altering their external appearance and behavior. The research uses flow cytometry to determine the genetic sex of infected individuals, revealing that both male and female mayflies are affected by the parasite. The study suggests that these changes are an adaptive strategy for the parasite to ensure upstream dispersal, return to water for the completion of its life cycle, and maximum use of host nutrients.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
