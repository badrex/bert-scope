They also discover that other major primate clades, such as Strepsirhini, Platyrrhini, and Hominoidea, have had similar rates of clade growth despite their biological differences. This study provides insights into macroevolutionary patterns and rates in primates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
