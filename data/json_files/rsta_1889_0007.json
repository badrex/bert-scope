They used a method called the \"isthmus\" method of magnetization and found that the magnetic force within the metal was continuous with the force outside. The results showed a progressive decrease in the outside field as the induction rose, suggesting that the intensity of magnetization may pass a maximum and decrease under the action of very strong fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
