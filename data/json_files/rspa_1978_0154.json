The dry weather led to soil moisture deficits, pest and disease build-up, and poor quality water supplies, resulting in losses of sheep, pigs, and calves due to high temperatures. The drought's long-term effects included enhanced persistence of soil acting herbicides and residues.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Weather"}
