They analyzed the existing models for ductile fracture and investigated the influence of grain size, temperature, and solute additions on the fracture toughness. The study found that void nucleation occurs at slip band intersections and grain boundaries in single-phase materials, and the distance between the first void and the crack tip is related to the material's properties and stress field. The research provides a better understanding of ductile fracture in single-phase materials and helps in estimating fracture toughness for various materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
