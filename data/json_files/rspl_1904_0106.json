The author discovers that the wetting of cotton causes a rise in temperature due to the condensation of water vapor on the cotton fibers. The study also examines the effects of varying conditions, such as the initial dryness of the cotton and the surrounding temperature, on the temperature changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
