The researchers used a combination of techniques, including the disequilibrium between members of the uranium decay series, to estimate the organic carbon flux. The results reveal a strong spatial and temporal signal in the carbon flux through the deep sea, providing insight into the fate of carbon in the northeast Atlantic.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
