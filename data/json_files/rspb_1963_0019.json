They found that the dimensions of the canal are closely related to animal mass and shape, and their findings support Steinhausen's concept of the physical mechanism of the semicircular canal. The study provides insights into the physiological response to rotational movements in different animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
