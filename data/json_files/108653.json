They discovered that the \"segmental organ\" is present in almost every ring of the body and plays a crucial role in reproduction. This research challenges previous assertions that annelids lack specialized reproductive organs and sheds light on the complex mechanisms involved in their reproductive processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
