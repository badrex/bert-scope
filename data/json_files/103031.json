The author, Dr. Ramazzini, describes the symptoms, transmission, and potential treatments for the disease. He believes it originated from a single infected animal and spreads through contact with infected cattle, cowherds, and contaminated environments. The disease causes fever, difficulty breathing, and pustules, leading to death within a few days.
