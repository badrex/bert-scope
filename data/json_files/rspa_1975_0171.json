They used these potentials to derive the widths and shifts of the resonance lines of lithium and sodium in helium gas. The results showed that the widths were about three times larger than those given by the conventional van der Waals broadening formula. The cross sections for fine-structure and depolarizing transitions were also calculated and found to be in satisfactory agreement with experimental data and more elaborate calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
