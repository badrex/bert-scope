The author presents a new approach to constructing solutions near spatial infinity, including information about the properties of the gravitational field as it approaches along space-like directions or along null directions. The study focuses on the relationship between the Bondi mass and the ADM-mass, as well as the correlations between the expansion coefficients on space-like hypersurfaces and the radiation field on null infinity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Waves"}
