The authors argue that novel situations require various types of processes, and they provide evidence of separability of these processes through neuropsychological dissociations and functional imaging. They also propose a theoretical framework for understanding the different processes involved in coping with novel situations, including strategy generation, implementation, monitoring, and assessment.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Neuroscience", "sub_discipline": "Cognitive Functions and Processes"}
