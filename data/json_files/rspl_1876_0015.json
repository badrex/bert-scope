Picrorocellin is the first crystalline organic substance containing nitrogen found in lichens. They described the properties, solubility, and reactions of these compounds, including their decomposition and the formation of xanthorocellin. The authors also provided methods for preparing xanthorocellin from picrorocellin using different acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
