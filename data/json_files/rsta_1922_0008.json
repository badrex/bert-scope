They discuss the influence of water, the action of alkalis and acids, and the exaltation of rotatory power in boro-tartaric solutions. The study covers a wide range of topics and contributes to the understanding of the complex nature of rotatory dispersion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
