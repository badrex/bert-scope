A. MacMahon. The theorem is of significant mathematical importance and interest in algebraic determinants and various applications in arithmetic. The author also develops a method to obtain arithmetical correspondences from redundant generating functions, leading to an infinite number of possibilities. The article also discusses the properties of determinants and their expressions in terms of axial minors.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
