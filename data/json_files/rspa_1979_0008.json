They use a mathematical model to analyze the fine structure of caustic patterns and confirm their findings through experiments using a ripple tank and glass slides. The research reveals the complex interplay of light and water waves, providing insights into the formation of caustic patterns commonly observed in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
