By adding a small amount of salt to water and observing the precipitation that occurs when a metal solution is added, Boyle was able to determine the level of saltiness in the water. This method could be used to analyze both distilled and natural waters, making it a valuable tool for understanding the properties of various water sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
