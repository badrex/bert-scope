The author examines the theoretical argument proposed by Sutherland, which suggests that viscosity is proportional to a function of temperature with a constant specific to the gas. The author's observations support Sutherland's theory and provide values for the constants involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
