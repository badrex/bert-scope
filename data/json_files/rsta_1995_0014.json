The authors review experimental results on hydrogen-charged YBaCuO materials and explore topics such as hydrogen site, superconductivity, normal state transport properties, structural changes, and hydrogen-induced magnetism. They also discuss the formation of a hydride phase and its potential connection to magnetic ordering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
