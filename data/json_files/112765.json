This charge can be detected using an electrometer or a galvanometer. The effect is more noticeable when wearing shoes with thin, polished soles and when the room is dry. This phenomenon can interfere with electrical experiments and should be considered when conducting research in such environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
