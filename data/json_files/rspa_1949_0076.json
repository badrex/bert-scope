The author explains the smooth transition of temperature from the troposphere to the stratosphere and how the presence of water vapor and carbon dioxide affects the temperature distribution. The study also discusses the approximately isothermal character of the lower stratosphere and the influence of ozone concentration on stratosphere temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
