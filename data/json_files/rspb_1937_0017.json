They found that the outside of the surface membrane is positive to the inside, and that localized injury causes the injured part to be electrically negative to the uninjured surface. The authors also investigated the composition of muscle fibers and the effects of various solutions on the membrane properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
