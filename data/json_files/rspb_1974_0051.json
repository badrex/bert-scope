The protein was isolated from the medium in which the kidney cells were cultured and shared similarities with hamster urinary Tamm-Horsfall glycoprotein in terms of composition and probable molecular size. Further study is required to understand the relation between these glycoproteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
