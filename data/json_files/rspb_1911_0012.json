They discovered that the increase in fat content is not solely due to proteins breaking down into fat, but also due to other substances produced during the ripening process. The study found that the presence of cholesterol and aminovaleric acids, as well as putrescine and cadaverine, contribute to the increase in fat content in cheese.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Lipid Metabolism"}
