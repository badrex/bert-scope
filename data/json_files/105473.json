Messier observed the solar eclipse of August 16, 1765, using a Gregorian reflector telescope with a micrometer. He measured the diameter of the sun, the beginning of the eclipse, and the remaining bright parts of the sun's diameter. The observation took place at the Observatory of the Marquis of Courtenvaux near Paris. Messier's observations provided valuable data for understanding the eclipse and its effects on the sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
