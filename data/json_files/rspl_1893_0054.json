They found that the polarisation remained constant, independent of the strength of the solution and the intensity of the current. The results showed that the polarisation was 2.09 volts on average, and the rate of fall of polarisation depended on the time the current had been electrolyzing the solution and its intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
