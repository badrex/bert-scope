Residual elements, such as carbon and phosphorus, negatively impact the ductility of these steels. Conversely, additions of high levels of elements like silicon, manganese, and sulfur are beneficial. A minimum of 0.01% boron is recommended for improving the properties of these steels.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Manufacturing"}
