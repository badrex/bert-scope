They discovered that lithium antimonyl tartrate was an effective cure when administered subcutaneously. This treatment eliminated the trypanosomes from the blood and prevented recurrence of the disease. The authors also tested other antimony compounds, but found them less effective than lithium antimonyl tartrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
