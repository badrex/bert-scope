Brown and P. Rickless developed a new method to study cell division and extension in plant root meristems. They found that cell division is affected by the presence of sugar, inorganic salts, and yeast extract, while cell extension depends on a balance of sugar, inorganic salts, and protein synthesis. The study also showed that root growth is faster at 15\u00b0C compared to 25\u00b0C and 5\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
