It explores the regulation of cell number and identity, as well as the influence of the neural tube and mesodermal cells on the proliferation, survival, and differentiation of prospective dorsal root ganglia cells. The study also highlights the importance of BDNF, NT-3, and basic FGF in mediating this environmental signaling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
