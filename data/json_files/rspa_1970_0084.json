They separated the temperature and volume-dependent variations in dielectric constants and discussed the anharmonic self-energies of long-wave transverse-optic phonons. The results provide insights into the anharmonic effects in ionic compounds and their potential applications in materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
