The device allows for the study of showers and helps determine the origin of cosmic rays. The electromagnet design is efficient in terms of power consumption and enables the observation of longer tracks, leading to more accurate measurements of cosmic ray energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
