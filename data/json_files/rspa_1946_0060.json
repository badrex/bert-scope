The author uses invariant theory to analyze the properties of axisymmetric turbulence, focusing on the fundamental velocity correlation and the rates of change of mean squares of vorticity components. The study provides insights into the behavior of turbulence in fluid dynamics and its relation to isotropic turbulence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
