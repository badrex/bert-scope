They identify two types of corpuscles in the Skate, the granule blood-cell and the red, oval-shaped nucleated cell. The study reveals that the granule blood-cell is composed of granules surrounded by a cell membrane, and upon examination with water and acetic acid, a cellaeform nucleus is observed. This research provides insight into the similarities and differences in blood corpuscles among vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
