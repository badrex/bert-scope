This factor arises from the idea that advanced life-forms would give physical expression to a highly distinguished mathematical truth in a canonical way. The author defines this structure, called the canonical artefact, as a minimal object that bears evidence of advanced intelligence. The article explores the implications of this concept and its potential impact on the understanding of the emergence of advanced life-forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
