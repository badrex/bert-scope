They then derive the generalized supersymmetric Yang-Mills algebras for specific theories with central charge, from which the chiral superfields and Lagrangians are constructed. This work provides a systematic approach to understanding superfields and super-Lagrangians in supersymmetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
