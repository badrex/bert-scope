They found that the heat of adsorption was independent of the amount of gas already on the copper surface and that hydrogen dissolves in the copper after adsorption. This research contributes to understanding the structures of surfaces and their catalytic action.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
