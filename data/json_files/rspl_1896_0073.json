They find that early sensation return occurs even when nerve reunion has not taken place, and they describe the process of nerve regeneration through microscopical analysis. The authors also discuss the role of cicatricial intercalary segments in nerve regeneration and the factors affecting the restoration of nerve function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
