This phenomenon was discovered in bismuth and later found in other metals like gallium, tin, graphite, and antimony. The effect can be explained by assuming that only a small number of free electrons per atom are effective, and these electrons have small effective masses. These effective electrons are associated with the curvature of the Fermi surface and can help explain the magnetic anisotropy of single crystals of various metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
