The authors found that these salts have low melting points and varying chemical stability, making them suitable for diverse scientific and technological applications. They report on the melting parameters, viscosity, and electrical conductivity of these organic ionic melts, as well as the volume and enthalpy changes at transition and melting points. The ease of varying the cation and anion configurations in these melts makes them unique for studying melting mechanisms and exploring novel reaction mechanisms in organic ionic liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
