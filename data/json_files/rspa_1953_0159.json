They discovered that these changes can be explained by reflexions from a curved surface associated with travelling disturbances. The research also showed that these disturbances are present most of the time during the day, affecting the ionosphere's virtual height and causing different types of complexity in the reflexions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
