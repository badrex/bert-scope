They analyzed the rotational structure of the 2pXII levels for vibrational states corresponding to v\" = 1, 2, and 3. The study provided insights into the atomic and molecular structure of hydrogen, contributing to the understanding of quantum mechanics and atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
