He found that the air thermometer had limitations and suggested improvements, such as using a reservoir of oil or mercury instead of a graduated tube. Prinsep also discussed the limitations of existing pyrometers and proposed a new method for measuring the fusing points of metals. His experiments aimed to provide more accurate and reliable measurements of high temperatures for various applications in the arts and sciences.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
