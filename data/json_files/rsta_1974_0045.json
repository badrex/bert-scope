The procedure allows for the calculation of internal tides with various topographies and density stratifications. The research focuses on continental slopes with simple linear and quarter-circle profiles and constant stratification. The results show that the largest internal tidal velocities and energy densities occur in regions around characteristics emanating from the tangential corner point. The total energy flux is greater than the maximum for flat-bump topography of comparable height by a factor of order 2-3. The study also suggests that internal tidal generation will give rise to two mixing processes: one associated with the boundary layer near the tangent point and the other with shear instability in the velocity profile.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
