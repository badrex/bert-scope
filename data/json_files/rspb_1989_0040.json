The study investigates the evidence for algal and host involvement in nutrient conservation and depletion, as well as the potential mechanisms for nutrient uptake. The findings suggest that the host plays a significant role in net ammonium uptake by intact symbioses, while the evidence for nitrate assimilation is equivocal. The depletion-diffusion model can account for net ammonium uptake, but not for phosphate or nitrate uptake. The study also discusses the possibility of phosphorus limitation as a means for the host to regulate algal growth in symbiosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
