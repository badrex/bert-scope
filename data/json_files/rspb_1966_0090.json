They found that the heavy chains have mixed amino acid sequences, with some sections of constant sequence. The authors used various techniques, such as cyanogen bromide treatment and peptide sequencing, to analyze the structure and identify the amino terminal and carboxyl terminal residues. Their findings provide insights into the structure and function of immunoglobulins, which can help in understanding the immune system and developing treatments for immune-related diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
