They tested the algorithm using three examples: water molecule positions in myoglobin and plastocyanin, and hydrogen-bonded atoms in methotrexate and NADPH co-crystallized with dihydrofolate reductase, and amidinophenyl-pyruvate co-crystallized with trypsin. The algorithm's predictions were in agreement with experimental data, demonstrating its potential for automated site-directed drug design.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
