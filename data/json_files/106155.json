The author, T. Barker, records the barometer, thermometer, and rainfall data, as well as the state of crops and the impact of weather on hay production and harvest. The article highlights the relationship between wet summers and abundant grass growth but notes that drier seasons are more favorable for corn crops. The period from 1741 to 1750 is mentioned as the most plentiful in terms of crop yields, while the wet year of 1763 marked a decline in crop success.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
