The satellite carried experiments to measure radio frequency noise, energetic charged particle streams, and plasma electron density and temperature. The data collected from Ariel 4 helped to identify the relationship between energetic particles and electromagnetic radiation, contributing to the understanding of the upper ionosphere's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Spacecraft Technology"}
