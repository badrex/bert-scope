The research provides a detailed analysis of the stratigraphy and paleobotany of the area, including the identification of plant communities and their succession throughout the Interglacial period. The findings are correlated with other areas in Britain and on the Continent, dating the Lower and Upper Glacial Series to the Elster and Saale Glaciations, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
