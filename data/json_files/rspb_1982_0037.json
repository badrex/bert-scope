They discovered that different strains of the dinoflagellate have distinct PCP conformers, which can be used as a tool for strain identification and potentially as a marker for sexual recombination. This research helps in understanding the population biology of these organisms and their relationship with their host species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
