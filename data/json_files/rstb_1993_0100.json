The author argues that gastroliths primarily serve as a means of buoyancy control rather than food processing, based on a comparative analysis of their distribution among different marine tetrapod groups. The study also discusses the potential role of gastroliths in various aspects of marine tetrapod biology and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
