They address the inconsistency of the equation when including electromagnetic interaction and propose a modification to the internal structure of the particle to resolve this issue. The new wave equation allows for a spinless particle to interact with the electromagnetic field without introducing inconsistencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
