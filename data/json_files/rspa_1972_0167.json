They observed and analyzed the spectra of H2S and D2S, and derived structures for both the upper and lower electronic states. The study provides insights into the molecular parameters and vibrational levels of the ion radical, which can be useful for understanding the behavior of other molecules in the series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
