The research found that these hyraxes have an annual cycle of testicular activity characterized by intense spermatogenesis and elevated androgen status from May to July. This contradicts the belief that equatorial hyraxes breed all year and suggests that the testicular cycle is a conservative element of hyracoid reproductive strategy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
