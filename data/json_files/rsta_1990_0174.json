The authors review fundamental parameters in microscopy at micrometer resolution, examine theoretical resolution limits, and analyze critical parameters such as voxel-size-dependent signal-to-noise ratio and magnetic-field-strength-dependent resolution. They present experimental results obtained with a 7.0 T microscopic imaging system, emphasizing cellular imaging and localized imaging. The authors conclude that NMR microscopy has the potential to provide micrometer-resolution images within acceptable measurement time, allowing the study of biological samples such as embryos at the cellular level.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
