It examines the changes in land area, topography, and height above sea level due to glacial advances and retreats. Fossilized remains of tortoises, crocodiles, lizards, birds, and snails provide evidence of colonization and extinction patterns on the atoll. The study reveals the dynamic nature of island biotas and the impact of sea level changes on colonization and habitat availability.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
