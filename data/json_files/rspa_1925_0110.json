The authors developed a new method using a vibrating spring test piece and a thermionic valve to maintain vibrations at high frequencies. They found that the fatigue limit of metals is dependent on the rate of alternation of stress, and that higher frequencies can affect the fatigue properties of materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
