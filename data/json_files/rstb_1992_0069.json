The experiments show that listeners cannot use coherence of frequency modulation to separate two sets of changing harmonics. However, listeners can group changing harmonics and segregate them from stationary harmonics. The results demonstrate the importance of harmonicity in auditory segregation and the limitations of using coherent changes in frequency modulation for voice separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
