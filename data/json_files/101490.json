Gotignies, over the observation and technology of optic glasses. It also mentions that the spot was observed in England before any news of its discovery. Divinis claims to have found a way to determine the quality of an object glass just by looking at it, which would be useful for identifying good telescopes before they are completed.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
