The tortoises are unevenly distributed across the atoll, with local densities ranging from 0 to 217 per hectare. The research also examines various environmental factors affecting their distribution, growth, and movement patterns. The tortoise population in the southeast of the atoll is found to be declining, with vegetation in the area being significantly modified by their activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
