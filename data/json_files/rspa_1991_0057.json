The authors compare the stability characteristics of different fluid profiles, including smooth exponential, error function, and integrated error function profiles, as well as a piecewise-linear profile. They find that the piecewise-linear profile has larger growth rates and more unstable wavelengths than smooth profiles, highlighting the importance of considering smooth profiles for a more accurate understanding of wave generation and stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
