It highlights the role of sterols in insect growth, metamorphosis, and reproduction, and examines the biological and physiological significance of these pathways in insects, as well as their relationship to analogous pathways in plants and vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
