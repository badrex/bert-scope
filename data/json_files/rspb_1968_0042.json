They found that certain enzymes, such as zinc protoporphyrin chelatase, S-adenosylmethionine-magnesium protoporphyrin methyltransferase, and succinic dehydrogenase, were associated with both chromatophores and non-pigmented particulate material, likely the cytoplasmic membrane. This study adds to the understanding of the nature and origin of chromatophores in photosynthetic bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
