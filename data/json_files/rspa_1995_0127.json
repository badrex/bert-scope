They discuss the consequences of this proof for the universal moduli space approach to string theory. The authors also clarify the proof given by BKM for the formula for the Polyakov string measure in genus 3 and provide a proof of the conjectural formula for the bosonic string partition function in genus 4.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
