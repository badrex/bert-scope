They found that different types of nerves have varying fiber size compositions, with some nerves containing large fibers while others have smaller ones. The study provides insights into the design of the nervous system of cephalopods and vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
