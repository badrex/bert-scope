The development of mammalian features, such as a complete secondary palate, a single arch of the atlas, and changes in feeding habits, are discussed. The author argues that these changes were driven by the need to adapt to new food sources and increased activity, ultimately leading to the formation of mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
