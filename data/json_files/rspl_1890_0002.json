Born in 1822, Clausius studied at the University of Berlin and held various professorships throughout his career. He is best known for his work on the Second Law of Thermodynamics, which states that heat naturally flows from hot to cold bodies. His research also influenced the development of molecular physics and electromagnetic theory. Clausius received numerous honors and awards for his work, including the Copley Medal and the Order of the Legion of Honour. He passed away in 1888.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
