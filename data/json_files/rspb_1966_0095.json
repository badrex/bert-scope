The author explores the genetic control of antibody formation and the potential mechanisms behind the generation of antibody variety. The article also highlights experimental evidence of genetic components in the immune response and the role of genetic factors in immunity to infection and antibody formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
