The author examines various factors affecting visual acuity, color perception, and the role of chromatic aberration in the eye. The study also explores the potential for improving vision through correcting chromatic dispersion and the impact of different colored lights on visual acuity.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Vision and Perception"}
