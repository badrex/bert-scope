The study of bacterial life-cycles and adaptations is essential for understanding their role in both saprophytic and parasitic conditions. This research challenges the current understanding of bacteria as unicellular organisms and suggests that their life-cycles can be complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
