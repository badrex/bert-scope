They found that state A has a low dissociation energy and may possess only two stable vibrational levels. The study also revealed that state B is predissociated, and the upper state of the 303.0 nm continuum is likely responsible for the predissociation. The ground state of the molecule has a 52% ionic character, and the authors provide molecular constants for the ground state and excited states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
