It highlights how these diseases are transmitted through insects like mosquitoes and midges, and how their activity is influenced by temperature and moisture. The author also explains the importance of understanding the host-vector cycles and climatic zones to devise appropriate control measures, including vaccination, insect control, and environmental management.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Epidemiology and Disease Control"}
