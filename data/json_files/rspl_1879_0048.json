W. Pavy, discusses the volumetric estimation of sugar using an ammoniated cupric test. He explains that the test requires a certain strength of alkalinity to resist the effects of ebullition and provides a modified recipe for the ammoniated liquid, which includes doubling the amount of soda if using Fehling's solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
