It found that only the liver and lungs showed photodynamic activity, which is significant since these are the only two sites where tumors have been observed in mice treated with carcinogenic agents. This suggests that the reason for tumor occurrence in these organs is due to the accumulation of the hydrocarbon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Oncology"}
