The authors found that calcium plays a crucial role in the coagulation process, and its absence prevents coagulation. They also discovered that calcium does not combine with fibrinogen in the formation of fibrin, and it may accelerate the action of thrombase on fibrinogen. The study provides insights into the complex relationship between calcium and blood coagulation, which is essential for understanding blood clotting and its disorders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
