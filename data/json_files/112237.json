Varley developed a method to bisect the electric wave and determine the relative speed of electric waves through submarine cables of different lengths. This method allowed for more accurate comparisons of cable speeds and helped improve the efficiency of telecommunication systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telecommunications"}
