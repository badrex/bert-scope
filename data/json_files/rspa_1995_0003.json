They use the discrete ordinate method to discretize the velocity space dependency of the distribution function and apply a high-order characteristics-based method to solve the resulting hyperbolic conservation laws. The method is tested for various rarefied gas flow problems, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
