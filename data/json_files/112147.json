P. Gassiot, describes the construction of a rigid spectroscope designed to measure the positions of known spectral lines while varying the coefficient of terrestrial gravity. The spectroscope was tested and found to be effective in measuring spectral lines, but the author discovered that temperature changes significantly affected the accuracy of the instrument. The spectroscope was later improved to account for temperature fluctuations, making it a valuable tool for studying the effects of gravity on spectral lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
