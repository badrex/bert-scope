They also develop an electro-magnetic induction balance to study the effects of stress on magnetic materials like iron, steel, and nickel. This balance can detect the slightest molecular change in the composition of metals and alloys, making it a valuable tool for understanding the properties of magnetic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Induction"}
