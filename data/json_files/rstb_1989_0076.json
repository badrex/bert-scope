They explore different parametric models for infection rates and incubation periods, finding that the Weibull distribution and quadratic exponential function provide more accurate predictions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the distribution of incubation periods and infection rates to better estimate the spread of HIV and AIDS.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Epidemiology"}
