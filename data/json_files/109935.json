The author, J. Brinkley, compares early observations with the present ones and refers to the difference in opinions of other astronomers. He also highlights the importance of paying attention to observations at the winter solstice and provides a table of the mean obliquity reduced to January 1813.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
