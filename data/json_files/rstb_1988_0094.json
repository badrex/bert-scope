They found that amacrine cells are involved in various functions, such as providing a multicellular aggregate for coupled membrane potential, unit activity by individual cells, and local microcircuits caused by isolated activation of single dendrites or parts thereof. The study provides a reference for future intracellular and neurochemical work to facilitate precise identification of amacrine cell types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
