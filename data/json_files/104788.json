They found that different bodies had varying effects on the balance, suggesting that this method could be used to compare and measure electrical powers. The author also discusses potential applications and further research possibilities, such as understanding the relationship between electricity and magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
