They discovered that the type of particle depends mainly on the method of smoke production, with high-temperature reactions and arc discharges favoring the formation of loose aggregates. The authors also investigated the effect of electrification on coagulation and found that highly electrified smokes, such as those produced by the combustion of magnesium ribbon, have individual particles carrying a considerable number of unit charges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
