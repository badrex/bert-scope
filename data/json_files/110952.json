Auguste De la Rive, studied the luminous voltaic arc and its interactions with electromagnets. He observed the transfer of particles, the emission of light and sound, and the effects of different materials and conditions. De la Rive concluded that these phenomena are molecular and demonstrate how electric currents and magnetism can modify the arrangement of particles in solid bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
