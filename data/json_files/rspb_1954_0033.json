The Marsh factor is known to inhibit ATP-induced muscle contraction and bring about muscle relaxation. Myokinase and the Marsh factor both have similar effects on muscle fibers, such as reducing ATP-ase activity and causing muscle fibers to lengthen. The authors conclude that myokinase and the Marsh factor are identical.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Biology"}
