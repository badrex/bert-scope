The pin had passed through the stomach membranes and formed a callus, but the bird was still able to thrive. The author leaves it to the reader to determine how the pin could pass through the membranes without obstructing the bird's digestion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
