The authors develop a theory for stratified fluid flow, using operators based on properties of characteristic lines, which can be translated into programs for machine computation. They derive a complete solution for a two-layer system and discuss front formation and transition within the system, identifying two distinct types of fluid fronts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
