Women's preferences depend on their hormonal status, with women not taking oral contraceptives finding body odours more pleasant when they differ from the men in their MHC. This suggests that the MHC or linked genes influence human mate choice today.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
