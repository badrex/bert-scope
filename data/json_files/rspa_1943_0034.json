They found that the thyroid gland absorbs iodine ions to produce thyroxine, which is essential for regulating metabolism. This research provided insights into the function of the thyroid gland and the importance of iodine in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
