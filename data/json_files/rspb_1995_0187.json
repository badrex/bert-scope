The research finds that males with the highest daily mating success produce fewer sperm per mating, resulting in lower fertilization rates for females mating with these successful males. The authors suggest that high-success males may be diverting energy from gamete production to other fitness-enhancing activities, such as mate guarding, rather than investing in sperm production.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
