It found that the level of fluctuating asymmetry in male tail length was considerably elevated in the Chernobyl area, while the incidence of aberrant feather morphology was higher for tail ornaments of males. Males with high degrees of asymmetry in their tails and aberrant tail feathers bred later than symmetric and non-aberrant males, respectively. The results suggest that the expression of secondary sexual characters in barn swallows may be affected by increased levels of fluctuating asymmetry and biased mutation due to the radiation exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Evolutionary Biology"}
