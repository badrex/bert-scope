The authors explore different aspects of the sodium pump, including the involvement of ATP, the effects of various nucleotides on the pump's function, and the possible mechanisms behind the active transport of sodium ions. They also examine the relationship between the sodium pump and potassium movement, suggesting that both ions are essential for the proper functioning of the pump.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
