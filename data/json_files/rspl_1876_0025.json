The author explains how the law of reciprocity applies to vibrations of a system around a configuration of equilibrium and how it can be affected by factors such as wind and temperature. The author also addresses an experiment by Prof. Tyndall that seemingly contradicts the law of reciprocity, providing an explanation for the observed results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
