They found that these regions of plasma membrane have a closely associated, randomly organized filamentous meshwork, and that the basal region of R7 has a highly organized structure with long, parallel filaments tightly adherent to the plasma membrane. The authors propose that these planar membranes can be considered flat equivalents of microvillar membranes, and that the plasmalemmal undercoat may help constrain the movements of rhodopsin molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
