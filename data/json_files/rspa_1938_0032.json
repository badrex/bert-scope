They analyze the time variation of electric intensity in a beam of white light and separate it into a spectrum. The author also discusses the relationship between the spectrum of turbulence and the correlation between simultaneous values of velocity measured at two points. The study provides evidence that turbulence is isotropic, and the results can be used to calculate the rate of dissipation of energy in turbulent motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
