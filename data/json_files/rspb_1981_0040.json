The researchers found three layers in the cartilage with different preferred orientations of collagen fibrils, which contribute to the cartilage's mechanical stability and ability to withstand stress. The study provides insights into the self-assembly process of the tissue and its relationship to the directions of tensile stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
