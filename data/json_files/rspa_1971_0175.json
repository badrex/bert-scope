They found that grinding amber leads to an increase in the intensity of the electron spin resonance (e.s.r.) signal, indicating the presence of free radicals. The authors suggest that the degradation of amber starts by breaking covalent bonds, leading to the formation of monoterpene, such as -carene. This study provides insights into the physical and chemical processes occurring during the mechanical degradation of amber and the formation of free radicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
