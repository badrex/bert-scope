They used X-ray diffraction analysis and electron microscopy to examine the wall structures and found that Cladophora and Chaetomorpha have walls containing microfibrils of cellulose I, while Spongomorpha has a substance resembling cellulose II. The study provides insights into the growth and development of these algae and their cell wall structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Algae and Plant Biology"}
