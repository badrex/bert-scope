By manipulating the temperature in their nestboxes, researchers found that birds in cooled nestboxes laid smaller eggs, but there was no significant difference in laying dates between heated and cooled nestboxes. The results suggest that energetic limitations may not be the primary factor affecting the timing of egg-laying in great tits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
