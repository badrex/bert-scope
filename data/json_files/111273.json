The study reveals the formation of new compounds, such as menaphthalamine and dicymenaphthalamine, and explores their properties and compositions. The research also highlights the similarities between the behavior of naphthalamine and aniline in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
