The author describes the methods and instruments used for these observations and analyzes the resulting curves, noting significant changes in the magnitude and form of the curves over time. The author suggests a possible explanation for these changes, relating to the magnetic action of the sun on the Earth's northern and southern hemispheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Earth's Magnetic Field"}
