The male newt performs a series of tail movements and displays to attract a female. The tail movements are triggered by optical stimuli, and the male deposits a spermatophore, which the female takes into her cloaca for fertilization. The author also experiments with salt solutions to induce the nuptial coloration and mating behavior in the newts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproduction and Development"}
