They discovered that the toxic effects are due to a globulin protein found in the seeds. The study shows that this protein causes inflammation, oedema, and local ecchymosis when applied to the conjunctiva or injected subcutaneously. The authors also found that the rapidity and intensity of the action of abrus-globulin are proportional to the quantity used.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Proteins and Enzymes"}
