The authors describe the late calcium channel, a separate channel that opens during the action potential, allowing calcium entry into the cell. They also explore the relationship between calcium entry and sodium channels, and the role of calcium in nerve cell function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
