It explores how sterile workers in colonies with a double-mated queen can influence the sex ratio, which is against the interests of the colony fathers. The author suggests two mechanisms, sperm clumping and reduced sperm transfer, that may evolve to serve the interests of males in these species. These adaptations can lead to an evolutionary arms race between the sexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
