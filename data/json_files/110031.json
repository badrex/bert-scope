He found that the parallax of a Lyrae did not exceed a small fraction of a second. The author also discussed the effects of temperature on the instrument and observations, as well as the limitations of the Dublin instrument in determining parallax.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
