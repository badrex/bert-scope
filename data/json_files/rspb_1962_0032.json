It found that the amount of infection varies between host species and bacterial strains, with some hosts having a high proportion of infections not resulting in nodule formation. The research also shows that factors such as root length, seed size, and environmental conditions can influence the infection process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
