They introduce the concept of a background space, which simplifies the interpretation of the path of a free particle, light rays, and gravitational red shift. This interpretation is applicable to any theory of gravitation where test particles' and light rays' paths are geodesics of the space-time metric.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
