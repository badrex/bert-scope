They discovered that cutting the sciatic nerve significantly alters the muscle's sensitivity to electrical stimulation, with the changes being more pronounced in the direction of the current. The findings provide insights into the complex relationship between nerve injury and muscle excitability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
