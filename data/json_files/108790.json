They used various methods to determine the optical constants and coefficients of reflection and refraction for different materials. The author also investigated the form of the reflected ellipse under varying conditions of incidence and azimuth, providing valuable insights into the properties of light and materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
