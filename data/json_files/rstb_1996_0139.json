DNA is susceptible to endogenous damage, which can cause mutations and lead to human diseases. Despite the efficiency of DNA repair pathways, some forms of endogenous damage still result in genomic instability. The author highlights the importance of understanding DNA's structure and stability for the advancement of genetic knowledge.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
