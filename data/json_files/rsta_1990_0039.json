They found that the solar signal in the middle atmosphere is more apparent in the westerly phase of the quasi-biennial oscillation. The study highlights the need for further investigation and confirmation of the solar-terrestrial relation through longer observation series.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
