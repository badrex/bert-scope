The authors discuss the design of the fork unit, the effect of prong loading on the fork's logarithmic decrement, and the relationship between frequency and amplitude. The results demonstrate the potential of the valve maintained tuning fork as a reliable frequency standard for various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electronics"}
