When administered to pregnant rats, it caused feminization in male offspring, leading to a lack of male genitalia and the development of female genitalia. This finding led to further research on the hormonal regulation of sex differentiation and the potential applications of antiandrogens in medicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
