They found that the observed rate of photosynthesis in green plants is much higher than the rate of uncatalyzed hydration of carbon dioxide. This suggests that carbonic anhydrase may not be necessary for the hydration of carbon dioxide before it reacts with chlorophyll during photosynthesis. The authors also discussed alternative mechanisms for the hydration of carbon dioxide in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
