The observation was made using a reflecting telescope, and Winthrop's timekeeping was accurate enough to contribute to the understanding of Mercury's orbit. This transit marked the completion of three periods of 46 years since the first observation by Gassendi in 1631.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
