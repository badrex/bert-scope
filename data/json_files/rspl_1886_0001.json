They found that the rate of heat conduction varied depending on the tissue type and the direction of the fibers. The conductivity of these tissues decreased after death, and moisture or fresh animal matter could sometimes restore or reduce the rate of loss. This research helped understand how heat moves through different tissues in the body."}
