They found that small amounts of hydrogen bromide lower the limiting pressure for the onset of two-stage ignition and the appearance of cool flames. The addition of hydrogen bromide also affects the induction period preceding the first cool flame and the accompanying pressure rise. The results show that hydrogen bromide influences the complex pressure-temperature ignition profiles of hydrocarbon + oxygen mixtures and the properties of the associated cool flames.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
