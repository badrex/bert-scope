They introduce the concept of quaternions and demonstrate their distinct algebraic properties compared to scalars. The study also explores the applications of these mathematical concepts in coordinate geometry, trigonometry, and mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra and Geometry"}
