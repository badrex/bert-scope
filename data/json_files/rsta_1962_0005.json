They apply the theory to face-centered cubic, body-centered cubic, simple cubic, body-centered tetragonal magnetic lattices, and rutile structure antiferromagnetics. The theory predicts possible preferred directions for spin alignment in antiferromagnetics but cannot yet predict the most stable spin arrangements without more information on exchange parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
