They observed large isotope effects and found that the ratio of diffusion coefficients for hydrogen and deuterium was approximately 220 at 78 K, which diminished as the temperature increased. The results suggest that quantum mechanical tunnelling occurs between adjacent sites in the tantalum lattice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
