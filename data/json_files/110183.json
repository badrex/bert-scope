He found that magnetized needles were more affected by the sun's rays than non-magnetized ones. The author also observed that the effects were related to the degree of light and not the heat. He discovered that red rays had a greater effect on diminishing the terminal arc than blue rays. Additionally, he found that the effects of temperature on the needles were the opposite of the direct influence of the solar rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
