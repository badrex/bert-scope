They observed the deformation of the plate's surface by creating interference fringes, which helped them understand the type of motion occurring in the plates. This study provided valuable insights into the behavior of quartz resonators and oscillators, contributing to the development of more precise and reliable devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromechanics"}
