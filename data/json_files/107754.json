He discovered that rapid rotation of a copper disk caused it to develop magnetism when placed near bar magnets. The strength of the magnetism appeared to depend on the distance between the magnets and the disk. This research contributed to the understanding of electromagnetism and the relationship between rotation and magnetism in materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
