They examine the molecular field in crystalline media and its impact on physical properties, such as the transition from the liquid to the crystalline state. The study provides insights into the local molecular field's intensity and its role in binding molecules together in crystalline structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
