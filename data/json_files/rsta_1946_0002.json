This method has wider applications, such as to the formally analogous equation of diffusion and the equations of the laminar boundary layer in the motion of a viscous fluid. The technique is more accurate and less laborious than previous methods, making it suitable for a broader range of problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
