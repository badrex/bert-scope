They found that the first and second bands of states are almost fully occupied, while the third and fourth are almost empty. This knowledge of graphite's conduction states helps explain its electrical conductivity and sensitivity to temperature and crystal lattice perfection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
