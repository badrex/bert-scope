He made significant contributions to aeronautical engineering, fluid mechanics, and solid mechanics. His work on the alternating double row of vortices behind a bluff body in a stream led to the discovery of the Karman vortex street, which has numerous applications in physics and engineering. Von K\u00e1rm\u00e1n was also a proponent of international collaboration in science and a successful organizer in its field.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aeronautical Engineering"}
