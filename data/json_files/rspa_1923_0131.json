They found that measurable currents could be obtained using potassium as the negative electrode, and observed the relationship between temperature, current, and potential difference. The study also discussed the challenges of obtaining a clean surface for the experiments and the evolution of gas during heating.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Science"}
