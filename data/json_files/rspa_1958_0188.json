They observed the crystallographic and morphological changes that occur during the endothermic decomposition process, which involves the dehydration of magnesium hydroxide to magnesium oxide. The study provides insights into the structural changes and the formation of highly ordered aggregates of micro-crystallites of magnesium oxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
