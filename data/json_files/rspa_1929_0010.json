They found that the lines involving the ground-terms of the spark spectrum come on particularly strongly and are very long. The study allowed them to propose standard wave-lengths in the Schumann region, which can be used as a reference for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic spectroscopy"}
