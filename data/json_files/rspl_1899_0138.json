The papers cover topics such as the spectrum of a star, electric touch, molecular changes due to electric waves, and electrification effects of sodium in air and other gases. The research on sodium electrification was suggested by Professor J. J. Thomson and aimed to determine if evaporation of an unelectrified liquid produces any electrification.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
