They found that in normal cells, DNA and protein synthesis begin together, while in tumor cells, nuclear protein synthesis starts before DNA synthesis and appears to be a continuous process. This suggests that part of nuclear protein synthesis in tumor cells may be independent of normal genetic control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
