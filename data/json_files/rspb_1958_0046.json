The research shows that the y-globulin fraction of both human and bovine serum is responsible for the interference, while the albumin fraction has no effect. The interference is most effective when administered at the same time as the immune serum and becomes ineffective after four hours.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
