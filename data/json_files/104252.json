She survived due to her large foramen ovale, which allowed her to have more blood flow to her lungs. The girl's leg got caught under a mill-wheel, and she was trapped for some time. She eventually survived but suffered severe leg injuries and passed away a few days later.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pediatrics"}
