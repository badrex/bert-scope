Sulphur's Pacific Ocean Voyage", "semantic_tags": ["Terrestrial Magnetism", "Magnetic Measurements", "Navigation", "Marine Science", "Edward Belcher"], "tldr": "This article discusses the contributions to the study of terrestrial magnetism made by Sir Edward Belcher during his voyage on H.M.S. Sulphur across the Pacific Ocean. The author, Edward Sabine, describes the experiments conducted with different needles used for magnetic determinations and the temperature corrections applied to the magnetic force. The article presents a general table of results, including the magnetic force, inclination of the needle, and the horizontal and total magnetic intensity from the observations at thirty-two stations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
