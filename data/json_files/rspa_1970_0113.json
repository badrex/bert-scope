The study involved measuring the temperature profile and concentration profiles for stable species in the flame. By analyzing the emitted light intensity when traces of certain inorganic salts were added to the gases entering the flame, the authors derived information about relative hydrogen atom concentrations in the burnt-gas region. The findings provide insights into flame structure and reaction kinetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
