They expanded on Weinstock's theory by considering multi-oscillator processes, where the neutron exchanges more than one phonon with the crystal lattice. The results showed that the calculated cross-sections for these processes agreed with experimental data within 4%, providing a more accurate understanding of neutron scattering in crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
