The authors observe three distinct phases in the explosion process and analyze the products of combustion in various experiments. Their findings provide insights into the mechanisms of gas explosions and the role of spark ignition in the combustion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Explosives"}
