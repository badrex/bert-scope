They propose a method to express these properties in terms of effective molecular volume and find that compressibilities and expansion coefficients are linear functions of molecular volume for non-polar gases. The study also highlights the differences in behavior between non-polar and polar gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
