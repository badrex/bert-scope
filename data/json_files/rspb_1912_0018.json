They found that wild animals like waterbuck, bushbuck, and situtunga were naturally infected with T. uniforme, and that G. palpalis could transmit the trypanosome to healthy monkeys and goats. However, other animals such as bushpigs, crocodiles, and monitors were found to be refractory to T. gambiense infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
