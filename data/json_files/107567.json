This unique circulation allows Vermes to survive in a torpid state and reanimate when conditions are favorable. The author also discusses the different orders within the Vermes class and their distinct methods of aeration and circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
