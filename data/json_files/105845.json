The author found that the amount of rain collected at different heights varied significantly, with higher locations receiving less rain than lower ones. The author also suggests that an unknown property of electricity might be involved in this phenomenon. This discovery is important for accurately measuring rainfall and understanding the factors that influence it.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
