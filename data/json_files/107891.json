They discovered that the Zariffa's second stomach cavity has less deep cells than other ruminants, as the cud from acacia leaves and twigs is already succulent and does not need to be re-moistened. This adaptation allows the Zariffa to better subsist on its natural diet.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
