They find that radiation is produced inside the collapsing matter, with the outgoing energy flux appearing at infinity as the evaporation radiation discovered by Hawking. This radiation has a thermal (Planck) spectrum, and its properties are independent of the details of the collapse process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
