The authors review regional geochemical data and recent geophysical compilations to investigate the role of the pre-Caledonian 'Old Moine' complex in the evolution of the Highland region. The study suggests that the Moine-Dalradian boundary played a crucial role in the sedimentary, metamorphic, magmatic, and metallogenic evolution of the Caledonian orogen from late Precambrian to early Devonian times.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
