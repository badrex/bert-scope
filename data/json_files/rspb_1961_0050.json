They found that Streptomyces lavendulae produced an exocellular penicillin amidase that effectively hydrolyzed phenoxymethylpenicillin. This discovery led to the development of more efficient methods for producing 6-aminopenicillanic acid, a key component in the synthesis of various penicillin derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
