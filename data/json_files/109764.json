He used a new process that avoided distillation and separated the alcohol from other substances in the liquor. The results showed that the alcohol content in Port wine was 22 percent, supporting the idea that alcohol exists in fermented liquors ready-formed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alcohol chemistry"}
