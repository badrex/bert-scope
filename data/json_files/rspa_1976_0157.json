They determined the absolute scale of the oscillator strengths based on the measurements of Bell and Lyzenga and compared their values to those in the literature. This study provides a comprehensive dataset for understanding scandium's atomic transitions and improving the accuracy of its spectral analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
