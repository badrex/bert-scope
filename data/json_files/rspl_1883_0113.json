E. Ayrton and John Perry, present a new form of spring for electric and other measuring instruments. They discuss the theory of the strength and stiffness of spiral springs, and how the design can be improved to provide better magnification and accuracy in measuring instruments. The new spring design reduces the need for complex magnifying arrangements, making it more practical for use in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
