They examine the stability of an initially homogeneous wave spectrum to small oblique wave perturbations and find that instability can exist for random deep water waves under certain conditions. The amplification rate associated with the instability diminishes as the correlation length scale of the random wave field decreases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
