It explains how prostacyclin is synthesized from arachidonic acid and its role in regulating platelet-vessel wall interactions. The article also explores the potential therapeutic uses of prostacyclin in treating conditions related to increased platelet aggregation and prostacyclin deficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Hematology and Thrombosis"}
