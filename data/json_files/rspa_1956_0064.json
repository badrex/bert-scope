The reactions in alcohol solvents show similar features to those observed for saturated sulphides, while in benzene, the reaction with i-butyl hydroperoxide leads to a non-quantitative yield of sulphoxide. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanism and the role of unsaturated sulphides as free radical inhibitors, which has implications for their autoxidation characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
