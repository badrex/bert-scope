They found that activation of the sodium system involves either three subunits operating in parallel or a three-step series mechanism. The results support a trimeric parallel system or the corresponding three-step series system. The study provides insights into the molecular models of sodium gating mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
