The authors used profile analysis to refine the atomic positions, thermal parameters, and occupancy of the titanium-niobium oxides, providing a more precise understanding of the distortions around crystallographic shear planes. The study contributes to the knowledge of complex materials and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
