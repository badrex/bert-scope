They explain how the spiral shape allows for the expansion of the shell's spiral chamber and the operculum, which is essential for the survival of the animal. The author also discusses the potential applications of this growth pattern in engineering and technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
