The author, G. H. Darwin, explores the secular changes in the elements of a satellite's orbit, including inclination, mean distance, and eccentricity, due to the planet's viscosity and the presence of a second disturbing body. The findings have implications for understanding the history of the Earth and the Moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
