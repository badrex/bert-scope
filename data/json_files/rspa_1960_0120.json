W. Brewer and J. R. Milford, is an instrument capable of measuring and transmitting local ozone concentrations. It uses an electrochemical detector to measure ozone in the air and telemeter the concentration through a radiosonde. The device is lightweight, cost-effective, and suitable for stratospheric research, providing valuable information on ozone distribution and movements in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
