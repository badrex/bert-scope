The authors study the self-reversal mechanism in rocks from the Olby and Laschamp flows, which may have been caused by a negative magnetostatic coupling between titanomagnetite phases with varying degrees of oxidation. The authors also examine loess deposits in Europe and northern China to search for evidence of the Laschamp event and better understand the regional or global character of field reversals.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
