They found that the internode curves of different plants are characteristic and can help in understanding their growth patterns and taxonomy. The study also revealed that leaf displacement affects the internode length and can be used to analyze phyllotaxis and plant relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
