The authors analyze the flow near a flat plate and compare their results with previous predictions. They find that the flow remains laminar at the Reynolds numbers tested and that the breakdown of laminar flow depends on the distance behind the plate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
