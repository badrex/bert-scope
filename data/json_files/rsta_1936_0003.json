They discuss the challenges of measuring daylight, which differs from common artificial illuminants, and the importance of using cells with a spectral response close to the average human eye. The authors also define different types of illumination and their applications, such as vertical, maximum, and total illumination.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
