They discovered that the F2 ionization density tends to be lower on days when a main frontal zone passes through New South Wales, suggesting that a significant part of the day-to-day fluctuation of F2 ionization density is associated with meteorological changes at the ground.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
