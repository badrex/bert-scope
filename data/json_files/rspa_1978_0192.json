They proposed detailed assignments for over half of the 40 lowest energy resonances between 15-19 eV, providing a good general interpretation of the spectrum. This study revised previous assignments and showed that interactions beyond Connerade's type 1 excitation model were necessary to describe the energy distribution of low-lying resonances correctly.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
