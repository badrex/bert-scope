They observed the temperature differences between the air and snow, and the behavior of snow when exposed to different conditions. The author also investigated the possibility of evaporation and melting in snow and frost, and the effects of alcohol on freezing mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
