The study explores the multifractal aspects of attractors at critical points and the transition from a chaotic state to a \"soft turbulent state\" and eventually a \"hard turbulent state.\" The research also discusses the role of boundary layers and oscillators in the dynamics of the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
