He also provides a set of tables giving expressions of powers and products of coefficients in terms of symmetric functions of the roots. Additionally, Cayley discusses a symmetry in the tables and a theorem in the subject, which has not been observed before.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
