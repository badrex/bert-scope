These channels are not normally present in the oocyte and are presumably the result of the synthesis and processing of proteins coded by the injected mRNA. The study found that tetrodotoxin blocked the Na+ channels induced by mRNA derived from either innervated or denervated muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
