It discusses the construction of energy functionals for ground-state properties and explores various approaches that go beyond the local density approximation. The article also explores the relation between density functional eigenvalues and quasi-particle energies, as well as the insulator or semiconductor band gap.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
