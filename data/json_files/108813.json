They develop equations to describe the behavior of these structures under various conditions and provide solutions for specific cases. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of solid materials and fluid-filled structures in engineering and physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
