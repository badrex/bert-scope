The most common cephalopod taxa consumed by seals include members of the Loliginidae, Ommastrephidae, Onychoteuthidae, Gonatidae, and benthic octopods. The study highlights the importance of cephalopods as prey for seals and their impact on marine ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
