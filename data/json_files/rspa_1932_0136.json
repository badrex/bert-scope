The authors constructed models to investigate the behavior of water surfaces under wind pressure and measured the distribution of normal pressure on the surface of a wooden model of waves. The study aimed to provide experimental data for understanding the complex problem of wave formation by wind.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
