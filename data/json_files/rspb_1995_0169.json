High rates of divorce are linked to high rates of extra-pair paternity, suggesting that birds may divorce to gain a better breeding position. This discovery sheds light on the adaptiveness of divorce and extra-pair copulations in birds and natural variation in mate quality among populations or species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
