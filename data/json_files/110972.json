Claudet, discovered that red, orange, and yellow solar rays have a dual nature: they can both destroy the effect of photogenic light and produce a unique photogenic effect themselves. These rays can be used to restore the sensitivity of Daguerreotype plates, allowing them to be prepared in daylight and used in open spaces. This knowledge can be advantageous for photographers in locations where dark rooms are difficult to find.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
