They found that the fortuitous percentage departures of the daily ranges from their normal value were considerable, often amounting to 25% or more. The authors discovered interesting correlations between the fortuitous variations of Sc and the non-cyclic changes in north and vertical force, as well as between these and the departures of the daily mean values of the magnetic elements from their monthly means.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geomagnetism"}
