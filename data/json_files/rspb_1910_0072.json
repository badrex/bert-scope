They found that intravenous injections of antimony metal were the most effective method for treating the disease. The metal was taken up by white blood cells, forming a soluble compound that eliminated trypanosomes from the blood. The treatment showed promising results in dogs, goats, and rabbits, but also highlighted the importance of dosage and purity of the antimony compound. Further research is needed to improve treatment methods and understand the underlying mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
