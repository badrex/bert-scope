The author considers the effects of the inertia of reciprocating parts and provides solutions for the fluctuations in the engine's motion. The findings can be applied to the design and operation of engines with critical speeds to ensure safety and efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
