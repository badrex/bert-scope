They used a cloud chamber and ionization chambers to detect and analyze the particles. The results showed an asymmetrical distribution of neutrons, with a higher number observed at angles greater than 60 degrees to the bombarding beam. This study provided insights into the nature of transmutation products and their distribution in space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
