They discovered that most of the injected labeled material was recovered in muscle and skin, and that endogenous triglycerides in d < 1*006 lipoproteins were removed from the plasma at a similar rate to injected chylomicra lipid. The findings contribute to current concepts of fatty acid transport.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Lipid Metabolism"}
