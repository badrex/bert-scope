The authors investigate the forces acting between these particles and their interaction, leading to the understanding of nuclear mechanics. They also discuss the absorption and capture of neutrons by protons, as well as the scattering of slow neutrons, providing insights into nuclear physics and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
