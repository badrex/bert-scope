They found that when an iron bar was magnetised, it became more positively charged compared to an unmagnetised bar when exposed to various solutions. This was due to the increased action of the solution on the magnetised iron, which was surrounded by a slightly stronger saline solution. The results showed that magnetisation influenced the electrochemical properties of iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
