They expand the solution in ascending powers of a \"thickness parameter\" and demonstrate that the method is applicable to a family of sections that can be varied by adjusting the parameter. The authors provide several examples, including a cubic oval resembling an aerofoil section, to illustrate the method's effectiveness.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
