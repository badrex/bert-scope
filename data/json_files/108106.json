They discovered that the fibers have a fine reticulated cellular structure and are connected by delicate forceps. The fibers have a natural straight direction and contain transverse striations, which are more visible in certain animals. The striations are formed by the elevation of the fibers and create a regular pattern. The author also discusses the differences in the appearance of striations in various examples of muscular fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Histology"}
