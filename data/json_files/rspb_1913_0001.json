Evidence from the anatomy of different regions of the plant supports the connection between the Araucarineae and Cordaitales. The study also refutes the idea of Abietinean ancestry of Araucarinese, providing a strong basis for the Araucarineae's superior antiquity and anatomical association with the Cordaitales.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
