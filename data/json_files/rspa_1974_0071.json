The authors limit the growth of the instability wave by introducing turbulence between the fluids, which leads to a physically realistic and mathematically tractable solution. The model predicts a strong enhancement of the sound scattered upstream, which has implications for forward noise produced by jets and possibly jet screech.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
