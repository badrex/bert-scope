The lavas are mostly tephritic basalts with a cryptocrystalline groundmass containing sanidine and nepheline. Phenocrysts of plagioclase, augite, olivine, and titaniferous magnetite are present, along with a high amount of ore minerals in these lavas. This study provides insights into the petrography and composition of the lavas from the 1971 eruption of Mount Etna.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
