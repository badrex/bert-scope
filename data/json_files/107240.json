He found that Vesta appeared as a point of intense light, similar to a star, and had a smaller apparent diameter than the fourth satellite of Saturn. Vesta's small size and intense light suggest that it is close to Earth and is part of the same region as other planets Ceres, Pallas, and Juno. Further observations and distance calculations are needed to better understand Vesta's cosmological origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
