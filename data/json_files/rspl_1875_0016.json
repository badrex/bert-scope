The study reveals the concentration of locomotor centers in the marginal bodies and the sensitivity of medusae tissues to stimulation. The author also discusses the potential for using medusae as a nerve-muscle preparation for experiments in electrotonus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
