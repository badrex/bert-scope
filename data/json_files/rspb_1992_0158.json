They demonstrate that the Poisson sampling-based estimates converge to maximum-likelihood estimates from actual sojourn times. The method can be applied to various ion channel data and is useful for understanding channel gating mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biophysics"}
