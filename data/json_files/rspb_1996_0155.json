The results show a high degree of sequence similarity with bacterial and mitochondrial cpn-60s, suggesting that the ancestor of T. vaginalis once contained the endosymbiont that gave rise to mitochondria. This implies that the symbiosis occurred before the Trichomonas lineage diverged from the main eukaryote trunk.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
