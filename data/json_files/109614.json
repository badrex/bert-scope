He found that the mineral substance had different properties and composition than Hydrargyllite or Wavellite. The study included analyzing the mineral's hardness, specific gravity, and chemical composition, as well as the effects of heat on the substance. The author also discovered that the yellow and green crystals accompanying the mineral contained different elements and properties than those of Uran-glimmer.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
