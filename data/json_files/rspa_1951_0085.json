They find that the cross-section for the Coulomb potential is consistent with previous work, and discuss the behavior of the Born series for the transition from Yukawa to Coulomb potentials, debunking previous conclusions that contributions from higher Born approximations become infinite in this limit.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
