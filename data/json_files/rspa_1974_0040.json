They discovered that the lubricant exhibits non-Newtonian behavior when a critical level of stress is exceeded, and the magnitude of the shear rate is of secondary importance. The findings contribute to the development of a rheological model for lubricants in elastohydrodynamic conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
