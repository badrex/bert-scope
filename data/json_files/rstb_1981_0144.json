The authors argue that syllable-like sequences act as minimal accessing devices in speech processing. They also discuss the importance of understanding the computational processes used in perceiving speech stimuli and the potential benefits of developing information processing models with speech acquisition in mind.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
