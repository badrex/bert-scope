They show that 41 out of 43 isomorphism classes of these systems are non-deficient and exhibit dynamic regularity. The two exceptional cases are investigated for their necessary and sufficient conditions for complex balancing and their quasi-thermostatic and quasi-thermodynamic behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
