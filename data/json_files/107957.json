He explains how the interaction between a helix and a soft iron cylinder can produce electrical currents and how this can be applied to indicate disturbances in magnetic forces. Faraday also discusses his attempts to create electricity using the earth's magnetic field alone, without the use of any other magnets, and his successful experiments with a revolving copper plate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
