The study showed that the stimulated muscles developed ten times more tension than unstimulated ones, and their twitch contraction and relaxation times were prolonged. The results suggest that muscle activity plays a crucial role in controlling its contractile properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
