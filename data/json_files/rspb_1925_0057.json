They found that immunity is not continuously developed but rather follows an \"inductive period\" of two to three days before the serum becomes protective. The immunity response increases rapidly and reaches a maximum level, which is similar to the occurrence of crisis in pneumonia. The study also suggests that protective antibodies appear in the serum as soon as they are formed, and their amount is an accurate index of the degree of resistance to infection."}
