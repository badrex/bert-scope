The author discusses the diurnal and annual variations, the solar-diurnal inequality, and the secular change of absolute declination. The study reveals systematic and comparable diurnal variations of disturbance, a semiannual inequality in the diurnal variation, and a periodical variation in the range of the diurnal variation."}
