The researchers found that the pH levels and buffering powers of these muscles differ, with skeletal muscles being more acidic. The ratio of lactic acid developed in skeletal muscle compared to cardiac muscle is 3:1 when stimulated, and 2.2:1 in rigor mortis. This work is a preliminary study, with more extensive research to be published later.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
