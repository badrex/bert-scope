They discovered that the change of resistance in nickel is about eight times greater than in iron or steel for the same magnetic field. The results showed that the relation between the change of resistance and the magnetisation in these ferromagnetic metals is not generally represented by the expression A<\u03f5> = al4, as suggested by previous experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
