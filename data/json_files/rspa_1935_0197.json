They studied various compounds and their reactions, discovering that some compounds, like formaldehyde and organic acids, have a large enough absorption coefficient to be detected during combustion. The authors also found a new absorption band in the slow combustion of higher hydrocarbons, which they aimed to further investigate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
