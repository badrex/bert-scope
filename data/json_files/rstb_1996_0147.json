The study analyzes the cranial patterns of early capitosauroids and their evolution, suggesting that the Lydekkerinidae family developed from more advanced capitosauroid ancestors through gradual truncation of ontogeny. The composition of the Lydekkerinidae family is reviewed, including six to seven valid genera found in various locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
