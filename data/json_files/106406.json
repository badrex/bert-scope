The process involved creating a paste from the filings and oil, molding it into shapes, and baking it. The resulting artificial magnets could be manipulated to have their magnetic direction changed by placing them between powerful magnets. This method was significant as it provided a way to study magnetism without relying on natural magnets.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
