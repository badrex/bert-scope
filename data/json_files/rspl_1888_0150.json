The device uses an iron annulus surrounded by a copper wire coil embedded in paraffin wax, with tinfoil coatings on glass plates as a condenser. The electric displacement through the iron annulus sets up magnetic forces and induction currents in the copper wire, which can be heard in a telephone receiver. This device may have other useful applications, such as investigating specific inductive capacities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
