They investigated changes in the statistical character of various distributions and developed a scheme to handle distributions known through low-order moments. The authors also considered the inverse problem of determining the initial distribution from the weight-average chain length at different degradation stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
