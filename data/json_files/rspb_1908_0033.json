They found that both excitation of vaso-dilator nerves and inhibition of vaso-constrictor center tone are involved in reflexes causing a fall or rise in blood pressure. The author also discovered that strychnine and chloroform have different effects on these reflexes, with strychnine enhancing them and chloroform blocking them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
