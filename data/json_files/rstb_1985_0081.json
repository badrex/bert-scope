The eurypterid gill tract is discussed in relation to its possible functions, including aquatic respiration and possible air-breathing adaptations. The findings suggest that eurypterids were primarily aquatic animals, and their respiratory organs likely evolved secondarily.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology"}
