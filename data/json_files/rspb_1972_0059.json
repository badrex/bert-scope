They observed the unmyelinated terminal branches of motor nerve fibers in frog and mudpuppy muscles and found that nerve terminals contain accumulations of synaptic vesicles. The study provides insights into the structure and function of neuromuscular junctions and contributes to the understanding of neuromuscular transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
