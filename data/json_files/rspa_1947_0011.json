They found that the period of impact between colliding solids is about 200 microseconds, and the explosion is initiated by a tiny hot gas bubble. The flame spreads through the cavity and then bursts through the cavity wall, causing the main explosion. The explosion propagates through the film with a velocity greater than 1000 meters per second. The authors also studied the rate of coalescence of strips of explosive and the time at which initiation occurs.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
