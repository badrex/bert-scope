The authors found that increasing pressure promotes nitric oxide formation and that the nitric oxide to carbon dioxide ratios in the exit gases increase with the nitrogen to carbon dioxide ratio, even past the theoretical 0.5 oxygen to carbon monoxide ratio. The results show that nitric oxide formation is influenced by both thermal factors and \"ionization\" in the flame.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
