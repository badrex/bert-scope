They explain that the extensive conformational changes in sex chromosomes during spermatogenesis and the sensitivity of hybrids to genetic divergence contribute to the disproportionate involvement of sex chromosomes in reproductive isolation. The authors also discuss the potential impact of epigenetic divergence on hybrid inviability and sterility.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
