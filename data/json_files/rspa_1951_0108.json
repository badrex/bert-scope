Lanthanum shows an anomaly corresponding to superconductivity at 4.37 K, while cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium exhibit anomalous behavior. The results suggest that the electronic states attributable to the 4f electrons are split by the electric fields within the metallic crystals, leading to complex interactions and anomalies in their atomic heats.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
