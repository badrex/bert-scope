Desaguliers, discusses the concept of two types of electricity, vitreous and resinous, and their effects on air particles. He also explains the phenomenon of rising vapors, suggesting that it is due to the electrical nature of air and water particles. Desaguliers provides examples of experiments to support his conjectures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Electricity"}
