Alfred Wanklyn, investigates the reaction between sodium and iodide of ethyl on acetic ether. He identifies the direct products of this reaction as ethylate of sodium, sodium-triacetyl, and acetate of ethylene-sodium. The excess acetic ether acts on some of the ethylate of sodium, producing alcohol and acetate of ethylene-sodium. The iodide of ethyl acts on the first three products, giving iodide of sodium and organic liquids. The author predicts that liquid B will produce caproic ether.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
