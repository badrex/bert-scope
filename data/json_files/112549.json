The arteries and veins are found on the inner surface of the retina, while capillaries only traverse the limitans and penetrate the inner layers. This research contributes to understanding the comparative anatomy of retinas in various species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
