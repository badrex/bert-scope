They establish a connection between conservation laws and symmetries of the system, and classify various types of discontinuous solutions systematically. The study also provides a variational characterization of discontinuities and simple algebraic representations for discontinuities of limitingly small strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
