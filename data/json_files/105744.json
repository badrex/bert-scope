The study of the Sun's parallax is crucial for understanding the transit of Venus, which was of great interest during the 1761 transit. The author also examines the impact of the Sun's parallax on the transit's visibility and duration at different locations around the world.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
