This phenomenon contradicts the general rule that chemical reactions are accelerated by increased temperature. The author also found that the glow's intensity is related to the rate of transformation of active nitrogen into inert nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
