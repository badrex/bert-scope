The energy required for this process is a small fraction of the energy produced by photosynthesis. The experiments show that continuous suspended water columns or high internal tensions do not exist in tree conducting elements during active transpiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
