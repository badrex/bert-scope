The population increased from 7 pairs to 113 pairs, with an average exponential growth rate of 5% per year. The breeding success improved from an average of 0.53 young per pair in 1946-1960 to 0.71 young per pair in 1991-1993. Despite the young kites dispersing widely in their first year, they mostly returned to breed near their natal area. The area used for breeding expanded slowly, and the birds expanded their breeding range progressively on a \"rolling front\" rather than striking out into distant unoccupied areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
