They obtained a density map of the enzyme using X-ray crystallography and determined the phases by multiple isomorphous replacement. The structure of Rubisco is barrel-shaped and has (422) symmetry. The study provides insights into the enzyme's function, regulation, and assembly, which can help in modifying Rubisco for improved photosynthesis efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
