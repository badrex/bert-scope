They used an integration scheme derived from the Euler backward scheme to integrate the rate equations and analyzed existing biaxial data to investigate the effect of sustained load on concrete's deformational response under biaxial loading and elevated temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
