They are found in various organisms, including plants and animals, and play a role in hydrogen peroxide metabolism. The author also examines the morphological and biochemical properties of peroxisomes, as well as their synthesis and turnover within cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
