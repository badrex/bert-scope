They discovered a sequence of reaction steps and proposed a reaction scheme involving the formation of transient surface complexes. The findings provide insights into the mechanism of the reaction and help explain the lack of stoichiometry in hydrogen-oxygen titrations and the apparent lack of correlation with infrared spectrometric results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
