They discovered that fish change direction by propagating a wave of muscular contraction from the anterior end to the tail. This wave causes the fish to turn towards the side of the body where the wave is passing. The study found that the caudal fin plays a crucial role in fish with relatively short bodies, while in anguilliform types, the propagated muscular waves are more obvious and efficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
