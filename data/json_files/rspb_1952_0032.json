The authors explore the differences between flexible rubber molecules and folded polypeptide chains, and how these differences impact muscle elasticity. They also examine the mechanism of muscle contraction proposed by Pauling and Corey, observing two absorption bands in the spectrum of a complete muscle that could help distinguish between folded and extended polypeptide chains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomechanics"}
