The authors study the E. coli \u03b2-lactamase enzyme and its inactivation by mechanism-based reagents. They also explore the importance of understanding the enzyme's mechanism to develop new antibiotics and inactivators to combat bacterial resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
