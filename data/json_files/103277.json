These instruments, which are in the shape of a wedge, were possibly used as spearheads or walking staffs by the ancient Britains. Some speculate they could have been arrowheads or Roman catapult parts, but Thoresby believes they are too heavy for the former and too light for the latter. The letter also mentions other ancient brass items, such as swords and a spur, found in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Archaeology > Prehistoric Artifacts"}
