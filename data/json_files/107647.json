The apparatus consists of two large copper and zinc plates, with a wooden cylinder and horsehair ropes to prevent contact between the metals. The device is suspended and immersed in a tub of dilute acid, and upon connecting the conductors, magnetic needles and steel bars are affected. The copper plate conductor gives the north magnetic pole, and the zinc plate conductor gives the south magnetic pole. This apparatus has low intensity as a chemical agent and does not cause deflagration or ignition of small metal portions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
