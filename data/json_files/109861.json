They observe that the tadpole's intestine is filled with a soft substance that burns with a vegetable smell, and that this substance is later absorbed during the metamorphosis into a frog. The author also notes that the proportion of fat in different ova corresponds with the degree of hardness of bone that is about to be produced.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
