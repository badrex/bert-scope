The research found an overwhelming preponderance of clouds with positive polarity, which supports the theory that these storms play a significant role in maintaining the Earth's surface charge. The findings contribute to the understanding of electro-meteorological phenomena and the overall study of thunderstorms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
