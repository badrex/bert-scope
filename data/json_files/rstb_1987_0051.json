It explores the reasons why nitrogen fixation does not extend to eukaryotes and examines various aspects of nitrogen-fixing symbioses. The article also highlights the advantages of symbiosis with plants, such as protection from desiccation and access to nutrients through extensive root systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology and Ecology"}
