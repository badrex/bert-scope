The author argues that the sinuses are essential to the heart's action and provides a detailed analysis of the heart's mechanism, including the function of the auricular appendix, the causes of the first heart sound, and the action of the ventricle. The paper also explains the mechanism of the pulse and dicrotism.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
