The author develops a formula for wave-making resistance, considering factors such as the ship's speed, form, and the interference of bow and stern waves. The study helps in understanding the relationship between wave resistance and ship design, contributing to advancements in naval architecture and shipbuilding.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture and Shipbuilding"}
