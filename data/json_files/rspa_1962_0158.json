They studied the polymerization of methyl methacrylate initiated by chromium hexacarbonyl and carbon tetrachloride mixtures, providing insights into the reaction mechanism and kinetics. The results suggest that the polymerization proceeds through free-radical intermediates and offer a kinetic mechanism for initiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
