The author extends Hadamard's concept to real functions and introduces notations for the set of pseudo-functions. The study covers the influence of neighborhoods, domain configurations, and the connection between distributional derivatives and the distributional aspect of derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analysis"}
