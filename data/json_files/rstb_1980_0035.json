The authors review the chemistry behind nucleophilic displacement of the C-3'-acetoxy group and describe the reaction mechanisms, including the SN1 mechanism. The study focuses on the use of sulfur nucleophiles, which have shown to produce compounds with expanded antibiotic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
