They find that treating charcoal with acids increases the ratio of carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide produced during combustion. The results are explained in terms of an electronic theory of catalysis, where electromeric effects produced by impurities in the carbon are thought to be transmitted through the graphite lattice.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
