They found that the protein contains Class I and Class II motifs similar to titin and twitchin. Two mutants, lethal(4)102 CDa and bent-Dominant, have DNA rearrangements within the projectin gene. The lethal(4)102 CDa mutant has a mutation that prevents the synthesis of normal projectin. Both mutants die during embryogenesis due to muscle weakness caused by projectin defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
