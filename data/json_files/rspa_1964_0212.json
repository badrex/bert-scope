Glass-ceramics are created by melting and forming glasses conventionally, then converting them to fine-grained crystalline structures with unique properties. The Chemcor process involves chemically strengthening glass products, increasing their surface compression and overall mechanical strength. These advancements have led to new materials with unusual combinations of properties and improved manufacturing methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
