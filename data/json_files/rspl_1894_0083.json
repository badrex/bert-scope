They demonstrate the existence of an excess of current in one direction to earth under certain conditions, which can cause issues with electrical systems. The author explains that this occurs due to the formation of a film of oxides, which increases the resistance of the leakage to earth. This discovery is important for understanding and improving the safety and efficiency of alternating current systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
