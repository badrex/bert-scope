They found that the differences between mean results obtained on different nights were greater than expected, indicating the presence of an unknown cause affecting the observations. The author also presents three methods for reducing the observations and improving the accuracy of the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
