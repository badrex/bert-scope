The authors analyze the impact of these elements on hardenability, tensile and impact properties, and mechanical properties of normalized and quenched steel. They conclude that while increasing residual element contents can improve hardenability and tensile properties, it is essential to control these elements to avoid violating property specifications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
