They find that the broadening is not due to the movement of the luminous particle as a whole, but rather to processes connected with the problem of radiation. The study concludes that the broadening is likely due to the electric field of neighboring particles, as suggested by Stark.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
