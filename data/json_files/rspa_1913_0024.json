The authors found that non-electrolytes and electrolytes both act as precipitants of salts, and that the behavior of these substances cannot be explained by the ionic hypothesis alone. The results emphasize the importance of considering the interactions between solute and solvent in understanding these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solubility and Solutions"}
