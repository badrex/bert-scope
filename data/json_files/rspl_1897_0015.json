By analyzing the latitude, amplitude, and visible horizon, the author deduces the sun's right ascension and declination to determine the period that has elapsed since the heliacal visibility of certain stars. This study provides insight into the connection between archaeology and astronomy in ancient Greek temple construction and the use of heliacal stars for timing religious ceremonies."}
