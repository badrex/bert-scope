The oscillations provide direct information about the geometry of energy surfaces and the Fermi surface, which is crucial for understanding the properties of metals. The author also highlights the contributions of key scientists and the development of various methods to study these oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
