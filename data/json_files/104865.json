He closely observes the animal's behavior and provides detailed descriptions of how it removes its skin without making any holes or breaches. This process is compared to that of other creatures, such as snakes, crabs, and insects, which also shed their skins at certain periods. The author believes that understanding this phenomenon can provide valuable insights into the biology and behavior of these creatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology"}
