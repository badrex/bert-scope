The model involves a sequence of flow configurations, including a hydraulic jump upstream of each rib, critical flow above the rib, and a steep cascade into a pool downstream. The model explains rib spacing, which varies directly with the calibre of the constituent clasts and inversely with the bed slope. The author argues that earlier interpretations of transverse ribs as antidune or modified antidune flow or migrating hydraulic jumps are inconsistent with observed field characteristics and relations of the bedforms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
