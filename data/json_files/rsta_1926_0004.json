The author uses the Eikonal function of Bruns to analyze the effects of various types of aberrations, such as spherical aberration, coma, astigmatism, curvature of the field, and distortion, on the image formation process. The study provides insights into improving the design of optical systems, like telescopes, by understanding the interplay between diffraction and geometrical aberrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
