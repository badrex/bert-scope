Perkin, discovered a new coal-tar colouring matter called mauveine, which led to the development of numerous compounds known as coal-tar dyes. Mauveine forms various salts with different elements, such as platinum, gold, and bromine, and has a unique chemical nature that has not been fully understood. The author is still studying the replaceable hydrogen in mauveine and its constitution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
