They find that the availability of specific nutrients and environmental factors, such as temperature and light intensity, play a significant role in the growth and fat content of marine animals. This research helps to explain the fluctuations in the growth of fish and the changes in their organs, where reserve materials like fats are stored.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
