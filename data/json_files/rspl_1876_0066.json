They found that the temporary increase in resistance is directly proportional to the stretching force and that the increase in resistance is greater in iron and brass wires compared to steel wires. The authors also discovered a residual increase in resistance that cannot be explained by mere lengthening and section reduction, which is greater in iron and steel than in brass wires.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
