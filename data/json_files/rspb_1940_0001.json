The researchers found that central summation occurs when two notes of different frequencies are presented to the ears, and that the presence of an audible tone causes difficulty in determining the contralateral threshold. When the two notes are in unison, a rise in the threshold occurs. The results indicate that the summation effect cannot be due to interaction between cochlear resonators, as it occurs with wide differences in pitch."}
