The authors found that the total strength of vorticity leaving a semi-span of the aerofoil is equal to the circulation around the median section. The distribution of vorticity behind the aerofoil is connected with the distribution of lift along the span. The research provides an experimental verification of Lanchester's theoretical relation and illustrates the changes in the distribution of vorticity in the wake as it passes downstream.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
