This finding suggests that the elasmobranch and tetrapod adrenals could have evolved from this lipine-containing tissue through varying degrees of suppression and migration of the tissues. The study provides insights into the evolution of the adrenal glands in vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy and Physiology"}
