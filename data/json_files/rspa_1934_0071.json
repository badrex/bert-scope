They found that the scattering curves exhibit features such as diffraction effects and a unique maximum that depends on the energies of the incident and outgoing electrons. The results provide valuable information about the collision process and the behavior of atomic electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
