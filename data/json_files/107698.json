They discovered that sea-water contains ammonia and found no evidence of mercury, nitric salt, iron, or copper in the samples. The author also determined that sea-water does not contain muriate of lime, sulfate of soda, or carbonate of magnesia, challenging previous assumptions about the composition of sea-water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Marine Chemistry"}
