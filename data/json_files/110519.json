The comparison was conducted to resolve discrepancies in the results of previous weighings. The experiment involved multiple brass and platina weights, and the weighings were performed with great care to ensure accurate results. The author emphasizes the importance of determining the specific gravity and metal composition of weights for accurate comparisons in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
