They found that sympathetic nerve stimulation and sympathomimetic amines increase tracheal mucus output, while parasympathetic nerve stimulation also increases mucus protein output. The mucus collected was analyzed chemically, revealing two groups of glycoproteins and the main monosaccharides present in tracheal mucus glycoproteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
