A positive correlation was discovered between total prefledging brood weight and both intensity of Haemoproteus blood parasite infection and heterophile:lymphocyte (H:L) ratio. Experimental reduction of clutch size led to decreased intensity of Haemoproteus parasitemia, indicating that great tits accept immunosuppression to increase their reproductive investment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
