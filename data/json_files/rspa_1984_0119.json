The invariant is derived using a specific form of the ellipsoid's expansion and is shown to be related to the Hamiltonian of the image motion in a transformed reference frame. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of particles in expanding force fields and could be useful in various applications, such as in the design of particle accelerators and the study of expanding cavities.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
