He worked on various types of alloy steels, including those with high resistance to corrosion. Hatfield played a crucial role in the development of the 18-8 chromium-nickel austenitic stainless steel, known as \"Staybrite,\" which is now widely used in various industries. He also conducted extensive research on the properties of stainless steels, their corrosion resistance, and their behavior under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
