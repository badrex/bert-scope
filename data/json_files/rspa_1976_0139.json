It shows that anionic polyelectrolytes accelerate the reactions, while cationic polyelectrolytes have a smaller effect. The results are in agreement with the Bronsted-Bjerrum-Manning theory, which explains the rate enhancement due to changes in the free energies of the reactants and the activated complex caused by polyions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
