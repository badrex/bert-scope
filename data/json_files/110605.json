J. Frodsham's paper demonstrates the advantages of attaching a brass tube, called an \"isochronal piece,\" to the top of a pendulum. This device allows for more precise control over the pendulum's vibration and can make unequal arcs of vibration correspond to equal intervals of time. The isochronal piece improves the accuracy of timekeeping devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
