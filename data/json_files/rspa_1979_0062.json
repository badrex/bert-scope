The instrument, composed of seven modules of large-area proportional counters, aimed to map the entire sky for sources between 0.25-20 keV. The survey successfully detected around 1000 X-ray sources, contributing significantly to the field of X-ray astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
