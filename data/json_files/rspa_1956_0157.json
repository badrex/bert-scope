They establish a connection between the series and the hypergeometric function, and describe a principal method of summation applicable to power series with coefficients that can be expanded asymptotically in inverse factorials. The methods are useful for improving the convergence rate and enabling the evaluation of series that would otherwise be impracticable.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Fourier Analysis"}
