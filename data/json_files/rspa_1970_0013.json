The authors develop a theory for the scattering by a single spherical gas bubble near a compressible spherical monopole and dipole source. The theory is in good agreement with experiments using bubbles near a spherical monopole source and in fair agreement with experiments on bubbles near nonspherical monopole and dipole sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
