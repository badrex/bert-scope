The author analyzes earthquake data to determine if there is a pattern in the frequency of earthquakes during specific times of the year. The study finds a well-marked annual period in most regions, with earthquakes occurring more frequently during December or January in Europe, the Grecian Archipelago, and Japan, and between June and September in New Zealand. The author also explores the connection between the amplitude of the seismic periods and the winter-to-summer ratio in the number of earthquakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
