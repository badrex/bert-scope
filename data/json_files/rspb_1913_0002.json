They conducted experiments on dogs and guinea pigs, including partial removal of the pancreas and exhaustion of the gland by secretin. The study aimed to understand the functional and anatomical independence of the islets and their relation to acinar tissue. The findings provide insights into the role of islets in pancreatic function and diabetes research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
