The author, J.W. Lubbock, discusses the relationship between high water height and atmospheric pressure, as indicated by the barometer, and considers the influence of wind on tides. The findings support Bernoulli's views on tide phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
