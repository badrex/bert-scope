They found that the ground state is a doublet and not a singlet, and the effective value of the nuclear resonance enhancement factor is around 2 GHz. The e.s.r. spectrum shows an unusual anisotropic behavior, which can be explained by the second-order Zeeman interaction. The results confirm that cubic symmetry is retained at low temperatures, and the properties of the compound are of interest due to its unique ground manifold.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
