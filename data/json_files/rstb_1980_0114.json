The authors found that methane molecules form a triangular lattice in register with the graphite surface at low coverage and contract out of register at higher coverage. The study also reveals the phase transitions and melting behavior of the adsorbed methane layer. These findings provide insights into the physical and chemical behavior of molecules in monolayers next to surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
