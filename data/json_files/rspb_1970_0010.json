The spermatophore consists of a sperm rope encased in a fluid, which is inserted into the female during mating. The spermatophoric reaction involves the release of sperm from the spermatophore, leading to fertilization. The study also discusses the chemical composition of the spermatophore and the changes associated with the spermatophoric reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
