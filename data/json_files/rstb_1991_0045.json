It highlights the use of protein expression techniques, nuclear magnetic resonance, and site-directed mutagenesis to study protein modules. The structures of growth factor, fibronectin type 1, and complement modules are described, and their functional roles in various proteins, including factor IX and tissue plasminogen activator, are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
