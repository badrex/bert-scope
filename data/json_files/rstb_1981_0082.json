The motoneurons were found to be organized in longitudinal columns within the lateral motor column, with similar positions in different animals for a given muscle or muscle group. The motoneurons innervating the anterior and medial femoral muscles were located in spinal segments L1 and L2, while those for the remaining hindlimb muscles were in segments L3-L5. The topographic relationships between muscle motonuclei were generally similar to those in cats, with some differences in the positions of specific motonuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
