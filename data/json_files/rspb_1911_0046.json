They also discuss the potential use of endotoxins as protective or prophylactic vaccines. The method allows for the disintegration of microorganisms while maintaining a low temperature to prevent chemical changes. The endotoxin solutions maintain their activity for at least six weeks, and a few inoculations of typhoid and diphtheria endotoxins have been performed in humans with minimal side effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
