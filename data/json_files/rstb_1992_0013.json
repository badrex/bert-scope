It highlights the differences in how younger and older children encode, store, and make identity judgments of familiar faces. The study shows that face recognition abilities improve with age, and children learn to cope with facial transformations through experience. The article also explores the role of inspection time, facial distinctiveness, and background context in face processing.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Development"}
