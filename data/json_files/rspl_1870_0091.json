They propose that the vessel walls and blood corpuscles adhere to each other and then undergo a contractile state, allowing the corpuscles to pass through without leaving a trace of the aperture. The author compares this phenomenon to the behavior of soap films and other colloidal films, which exhibit similar properties of progressive cohesive attraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
