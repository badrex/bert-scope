They compare the phenomena to ferromagnetism and discuss the order of neighbors and the order of the crystal as a whole. The authors also analyze the effect of fluctuations in atomic configurations and the interaction between neighboring atoms in one, two, and three dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
