The researchers found that the amount of CO2 assimilated increases with temperature, reaching a peak at around 38\u00b0C. At higher temperatures, the leaves' ability to maintain high rates of assimilation declines rapidly, and the leaves eventually become unable to survive. The study emphasizes the importance of considering both temperature and respiration when studying plant assimilation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
