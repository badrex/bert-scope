The authors found that radiation exposure shortens the life span of mice and advances all natural causes of death at different rates. Some diseases, like leukemia, show a definite increase in incidence, while others, like pulmonary tumors, show a decrease with increasing radiation dose. The results suggest that the probability of any one disease occurring remains the same in irradiated and control animals, with radiation mainly affecting the advancement of all causes of death.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Pathology and Oncology"}
