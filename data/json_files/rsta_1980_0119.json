The research focuses on the effect of impurities and dopants on the material properties, particularly the grain boundaries. The results indicate that certain elements can significantly affect the overall elongation rate and the material's resistance to intergranular failure.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Properties"}
