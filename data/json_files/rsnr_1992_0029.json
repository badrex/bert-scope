They used a long bandage soaked in a solvent containing anthocyanin and anthocyanidin, hoping that cellulose would show a preferential affinity for the glycosidal residues of the anthocyanin. Although their experiment did not result in the invention of partition chromatography, it laid the groundwork for future research in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
