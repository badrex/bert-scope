Corpora lutea form in a state of virginity and play a crucial role in ovum formation and impregnation. They also help in the absorption of coagulum and the removal of ova, whether impregnated or not. The study provides insights into the reproductive process and the role of corpora lutea in it.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
