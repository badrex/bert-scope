The author presents a general commensurability condition and derives rules and constraints for determining the predominant resonance terms in the disturbing function expansion. The article specifically examines resonances dependent only on inclination, providing criteria for their existence and the predominant resonant terms for each commensurability type.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
