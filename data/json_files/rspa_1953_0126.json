They found that the values obtained were independent of the particular instrument employed and established that non-linearity of dispersion did not require correction in the visible and ultra-violet regions of the spectrum. This study contributed to the development of secondary vacuum wave-length standards.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
