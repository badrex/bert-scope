Koji is used in the production of sake, a popular alcoholic beverage in Japan, and also has applications in bread-making and the manufacture of soy sauce. The study examines the process of koji production, the role of temperature in its growth, and the chemical reactions that occur during fermentation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology and Fermentation"}
