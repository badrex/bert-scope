They prove that the existence of these densities is connected to the existence of auto-Backlund transformations and the inverse scattering method. The study focuses on polynomial conserved densities of rank greater than 2 and provides necessary conditions for their existence.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
