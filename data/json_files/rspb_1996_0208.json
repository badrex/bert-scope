They propose that a combination of trophic interactions, specifically specialist predation, and some level of self-regulation is necessary to explain the microtine density cycle. This synthesis challenges the dichotomy between population-intrinsic and community-level positions and suggests that both factors are essential for generating population dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
