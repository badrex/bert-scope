The research is based on the dissection of 150 elephants in Uganda, providing insights into their reproductive organs, growth, and breeding patterns. The findings reveal that both sexes reach maturity at 8 to 12 years and can breed until old age. The study also discusses the elephant's diet, habitat, and behavior, emphasizing the importance of wildlife conservation efforts for the species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
