The Rowleyrag-Stone is found in Staffordshire and is used for road maintenance and paving. The Toad-Stone comes from Derbyshire and has a granulated texture. The author discovers that Rowleyrag-Stone consists of siliceous earth, clay, or earth of alum, and calx of iron, while Toad-Stone has a similar composition but lacks the calciform iron. The study suggests that Rowleyrag-Stone might be used as a flux for calcareous iron ores.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
