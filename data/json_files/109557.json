The law states that differences in heat from a medium are in a geometrical progression while the times of heating or cooling are arithmetically proportionate. The author also discusses the effects of heat accumulation in intercepting bodies and how it can impact the accuracy of heat measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
