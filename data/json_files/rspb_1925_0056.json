Kidston's expertise in plant anatomy and his extensive collection of hand-specimens of British palaeozoic plants were invaluable to the Geological Survey. His research on the internal structure of fossil plants and the classification of extinct plants as Gymnosperms greatly advanced scientific knowledge of the time. Kidston's legacy lives on through his numerous publications and the bequest of his collection to the Geological Survey and the Botanical Department of the University of Glasgow.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Palaeobotany"}
