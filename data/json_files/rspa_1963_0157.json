They develop a linearized perturbation theory to calculate the glacier's response to variations in accumulation and ablation. The theory considers the glacier's cross-section and slope, and the discharge of ice through any cross-section. The author applies the theory to South Cascade Glacier, Washington, as a practical example.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
