Calculations and Photoelectron Spectroscopy of Alkaline Earth Halides", "semantic_tags": ["Quantum Chemistry", "Photoelectron Spectroscopy", "Valence Shell Electronic Structure", "Alkaline Earth Halides", "Molecular Orbital Calculations"], "tldr": "The authors used ab initio s.c.f. calculations and photoelectron spectroscopy to study the valence shell electronic structure of alkaline earth halides. They found that the heavier metal halides have a nonlinear geometry and that the metal orbital plays an important role in determining the molecular geometry. The study also showed that a point charge model can be used to fit the ionization potentials for these molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
