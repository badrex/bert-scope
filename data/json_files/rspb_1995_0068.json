However, constraints on parameters can lead to chaotic dynamics. This study provides insights into how natural selection shapes population dynamics and the role of constraints in promoting or preventing the evolution of stable dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
