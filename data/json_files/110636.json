They observed and documented various changes in the ovum during its journey through the female reproductive system, challenging some of the prevailing theories in embryology. The findings provide valuable insights into the development of mammals and may explain similar observations made in other animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
