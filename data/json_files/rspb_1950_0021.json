They found that the ATP content of a muscle changes during the contraction-relaxation cycle, suggesting that ATP is indeed broken down during this process. This discovery is important for understanding the chemical basis of muscular activity and the role of ATP in muscle function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
