They found that signal intensity variations, known as \"fading,\" are caused by interference between direct and reflected rays from the upper atmosphere. This phenomenon is more pronounced at night and can be explained by the Heaviside layer's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
