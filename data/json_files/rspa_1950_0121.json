The EDSAC uses a single-address form for orders, which can be modified by the machine itself. The initial orders determine how orders are punched on the tape, and the structure of these orders can be chosen to simplify the process of preparing the tape. The paper also explains the representation of orders inside the machine and the use of sub-routines in constructing long programs.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Computer Science"}
