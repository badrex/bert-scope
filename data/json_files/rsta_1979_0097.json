It explains the selection rules for resonance Raman spectra and presents a vibronic theory for the excitation profile. The authors also explore the use of resonance Raman spectra in studying haem proteins and other metallo-porphin compounds, highlighting the importance of molecular point group symmetry and the potential for biomedical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
