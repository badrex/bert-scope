They discovered that the length of the spark in helium is significantly greater than in other gases, and they observed a ribbon-like discharge in various gases at specific pressures. The authors also discussed the purity of the gas samples and the possible reasons for the unique behavior of helium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
