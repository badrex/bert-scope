They find that for strong driving torques, the equilibrium surface develops a fold with two branches of stable rotation rates, exhibiting hysteresis depending on the approach to the fold. The results are applicable to other axisymmetric solid bodies and shells rotating in the presence of a transverse magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
