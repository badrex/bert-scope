The space-time outside the black holes' event horizons is asymptotically flat and smooth, except for a conical singularity along the axis where the string is located. Inside the event horizons, time-like curvature singularities occur. This solution allows for the transgression of theorems excluding multiple black holes and isolated charged black holes, made possible by allowing conical singularities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
