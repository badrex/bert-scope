It explores various mutations and deletions in the globin gene cluster that cause thalassaemias, a group of inherited anaemia disorders. The study of these disorders provides valuable insights into the regulation of gene expression and protein synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
