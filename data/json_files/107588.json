He found that the ocean's temperature and density were nearly the same throughout, and that the diurnal variation of temperature in the atmosphere at sea was regular. The author also noted the impact of storms, rain, and electrical phenomena on the ocean's temperature and the importance of understanding these factors for navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
