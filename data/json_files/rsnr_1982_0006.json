It challenges the belief that Bradley's inability to detect parallax led to a suspension of activity in the field. The author investigates the reactions of Bradley's contemporaries to his findings and explores the ongoing interest in parallax measurements during the period. The article highlights the importance of understanding the historical context and the impact of Bradley's work on the development of astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "History of Science > History of Astronomy"}
