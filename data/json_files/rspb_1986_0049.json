The experiments reveal that the phalanx species (Beilis) responds with increased module aggregation in the presence of Lolium, while the guerrilla species (Prunella) shows decreased module aggregation. The findings highlight the ecological implications of different growth forms in clonal plants and their response to environmental heterogeneity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
