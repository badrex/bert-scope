They found comma-shaped bacilli in 13 cases, which were associated with acute inflammation in the intestinal wall. The study also revealed that these bacilli were not present in every case and were not found in blood vessels. The author concludes that further research is needed to understand the relationship between these bacilli and cholera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
