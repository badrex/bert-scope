The author, E.J. Lowe, explains various factors affecting ozone readings, such as the velocity of the air, height of the barometer, temperature, hygrometrical state of the air, and elevation above the ground. The author also introduces a new method of using dry ozone powder tests as a substitute for the traditional tests, which are found to be unsatisfactory due to impurities in the materials used.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
