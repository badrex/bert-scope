The author presents various methods for creating and detecting supersonic waves, including the use of hot-wire anemometers and quartz oscillators. The study focuses on measuring the absorption and velocity of sound in gases, providing valuable insights into the behavior of supersonic waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
