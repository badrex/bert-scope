He explains that the spinal cord and excito-motory nerves are responsible for reflex actions, and that these nerves can be influenced by mechanical or galvanic stimuli. Hall also reviews the work of other physiologists and applies his theory to various physiological and pathological phenomena, including muscle movements, eyelid motions, and actions resulting from the passions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
