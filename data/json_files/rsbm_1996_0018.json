His research focused on vertical diffusion of pollutants in the boundary layer, evaporation rates, and the effects of surface roughness on wind and temperature profiles. Pasquill's work has been crucial for predicting the spread of pollutants and understanding weather and climate patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
