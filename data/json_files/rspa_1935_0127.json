The author uses an experimental method to measure the ionization caused by the gamma rays and neutrons, and concludes that the majority of the secondary radiation is produced by neutrons. The study also examines the energy of the gamma radiation and its relation to the atomic number of the elements involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
