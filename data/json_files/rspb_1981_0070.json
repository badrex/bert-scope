The model suggests that genetic reshuffling, such as recombination, is favored in environments with strong interactions between species. This is because mechanisms promoting reshuffling help organisms escape the full force of selected antagonists, allowing them to adapt and survive better in their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
