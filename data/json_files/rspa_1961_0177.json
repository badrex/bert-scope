The crystals have a strong anisotropy causing magnetization in the basal plane and a weak anisotropy producing an easy direction of magnetization within the basal plane. The study found a new reversing range of composition in ilmen-haematite with between about 25 and 15% of ilmenite in haematite, which is different from the range found by Uyeda. This new behavior is due to an ordering of ions on alternate cation layers through an electron transfer mechanism between trivalent and divalent iron atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
