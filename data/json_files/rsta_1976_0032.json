The authors use an array of diodes to capture simultaneous observations at multiple wavelengths, revealing the connection between magnetic knots in the photosphere and chromospheric activity. They also explore the decay of sunspots and the role of magnetic fields in the evolution of active regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
