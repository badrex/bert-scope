The authors discuss the difficulties these individuals face in distinguishing colors and the effects of simultaneous contrast on their perception. The findings suggest that these cases are bordering on tetrachromic vision, where a distinct sensation is created by the sodium flame.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision Science"}
