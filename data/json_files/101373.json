Newton explains his experiments with prisms and how he believes colors are original and immutable qualities of light rays. He also addresses the necessity of mixing all colors to produce white and the potential for creating perfect telescopes using mirrors instead of lenses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
