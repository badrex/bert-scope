They found that complex ions play a role in concentrated solutions, affecting transport numbers and ionic velocities. The study shows a remarkable agreement with Masson's figures for some salts and an approximate agreement with Hittorf's figures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
