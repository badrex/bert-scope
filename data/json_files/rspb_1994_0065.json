These persistent sodium currents contribute to the plateau phase of cardiac action potentials and are more sensitive to block by TTX and anti-arrhythmic agents like lidocaine and quinidine. The study provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of cardiac electrical activity and potential therapeutic targets for arrhythmia treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology > Cardiology"}
