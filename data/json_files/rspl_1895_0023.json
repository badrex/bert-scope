They analyze the relationships between different types of motions and the geometrical laws governing their associations. By understanding these laws, it is possible to create a method for expressing the constitution of a machine movement and to identify the potential combinations of motions that can be used in machine design.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Machine Design"}
