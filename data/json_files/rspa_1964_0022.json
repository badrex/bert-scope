They found that tetrachloroethylene accelerates the reaction, and its key processes involve the formation of hydrogen chloride. The study also shows that the accelerating efficiency of tetrachloroethylene is similar to that of other chlorinated ethylenes. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of propane oxidation and the role of tetrachloroethylene in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
