The research shows that the development of mammary glands is influenced by pregnancy and lactation overlap, with the presence of developing embryos affecting involution. The findings provide insights into the reproductive cycle and mammary gland development in this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
