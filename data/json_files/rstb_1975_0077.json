The authors demonstrate how this technique can be used to analyze the complexity of mRNA populations and identify the genes encoding for adult haemoglobin in ducks and rabbits. They also explore the potential of this method for characterizing DNA fragments carrying structural genes and analyzing mRNA populations from different cell types and developmental stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
