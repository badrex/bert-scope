Arderon, describes an improvement to the Weather-Cord hygrometer, an ancient instrument used to measure atmospheric moisture and dryness. He explains his design modifications, such as using toothed brass pieces to make the index's motion more regular and adding a brass collar to allow the cord to twist without hindrance. This improvement allows for more accurate readings of minute changes in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
