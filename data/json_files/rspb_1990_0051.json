They apply this model to experimental data involving 5-hydroxytryptamine and phenoxybenzamine on aortic tissue, demonstrating the potential for overestimation of agonist affinities when using irreversible receptor antagonism. The implications for pharmacologists and medicinal chemists are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Pharmacology"}
