They find regions of parameter space where the system exhibits relaxation oscillations and large single excursions before approaching a steady state. The study also explores the behavior of the oscillator when fuel consumption is included, showing that it exhibits finite trains of almost periodic behavior before reaching equilibrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Dynamical Systems and Chaos"}
