The author describes the stages of menstruation and the role of the uterus in the process. They also discuss the differences between the menstrual cycles of Macacus rhesus and S. entellus, as well as the changes in discharged follicles during the non-breeding season. The findings confirm that ovulation is a distinct process and does not necessarily occur during each menstrual period.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
