They determined the force constants and calculated the transformations from normal to symmetry coordinates. The results were interpreted in terms of bond moments and their derivatives, revealing a trend in the polar properties of the C-X bonds in the series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
