A new model is proposed, assuming that chemical reaction rates are infinitely fast, and the essential ingredient for successful ignition is an adequate concentration of fuel vapor in the ignition zone. The results show that both quenching distance and minimum ignition energy are strongly dependent on droplet size and are also dependent, but to a lesser extent, on air density, equivalence ratio, and fuel volatility."}
