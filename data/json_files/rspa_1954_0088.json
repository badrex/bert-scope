They found that the monomer reactivity ratios were constant over a wide range of benzene concentrations. The study also showed that the factor, which measures the tendency for termination of chains by interaction of unlike radicals, is independent of benzene concentration but depends on the monomer feed. This research provides insights into the role of environment and structure of radicals in the rate of their interaction during co-polymerization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
