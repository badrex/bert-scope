They observe differences in brain structure and organization, including the presence of globules, elastic matter, and fluid, as well as the arrangement of nerves and ganglions. This research contributes to the understanding of the nervous system and its functions in different organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
