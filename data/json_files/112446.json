They found that a region of slight barometric depression existed from Sumatra to Arakan, with a minimum to the west of the Nicobars. The author concludes that the cyclone was likely formed due to the diversion of wind currents towards the area of low barometer, and suggests that similar wind patterns may play a role in the production of other cyclones in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
