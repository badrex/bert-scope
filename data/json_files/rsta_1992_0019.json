The authors use modern methods of analytical and numerical analysis to study the behavior of the oscillator and its response to initial conditions. They find that the system exhibits chaotic behavior, which is sensitive to small changes in initial conditions, and discuss the implications of this for engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
