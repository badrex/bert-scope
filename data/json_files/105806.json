He discovers that the paper is made from the filaments of the Conferva Plinii plant. Strange examines the plant with a microscope and provides detailed descriptions of its structure, which he believes has been overlooked by systematic botanists. He also experiments with different methods of making paper from the same plant, resulting in various qualities of paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
