He describes the seven-feet transit instrument used for the observations and experiments to determine if the discrepancies were due to instrumental derangement. South concludes that the instrument was accurate and the discrepancies may be due to other factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
