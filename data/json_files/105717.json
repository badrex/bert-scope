The author suggests that the quantity of friction in large engines can be estimated at 1/2 the weight or pressure on the rubbing parts, while in smaller, more precise engines, it may be around 1/3. The author also proposes ways to decrease the velocity of the rubbing parts to increase the power over friction without losing time or velocity in raising the weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
