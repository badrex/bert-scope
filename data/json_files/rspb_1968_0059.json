They found that bound iodine is distributed throughout the tunic, with a higher concentration in the surface cuticle. The tunic contains protein-rich fibers and a matrix with carbohydrate fractions. The authors also identified monoiodotyrosine and diiodotyrosine in the tunic extracts, but thyroxine and triiodothyronine were not found, suggesting that iodine binding in the ascidian tunic is not a form of thyroidal biosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
