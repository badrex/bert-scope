The research investigates the ultrastructure of the chloroplasts and their ability to fix carbon. The findings show that the chloroplasts maintain their structural integrity and function within the animal cells. The study also discusses the mechanisms of chloroplast uptake and the pathways of photosynthetic carbon fixation in both Elysia and Codium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
