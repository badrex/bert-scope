These pigments are not identical to any known decomposition product of haemoglobin and are found in animals without haemoglobin. The author found that these pigments play a role in the internal respiration of tissues and organs, and their presence is associated with yellow or reddish-yellow coloration in the tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
