The author compares their power functions under contiguous alternatives and orthogonal parametrization, finding that the conditional versions have identical power functions up to the second order with the corresponding tests that assume the nuisance parameter is known. The study establishes an optimality property of the conditional test in terms of second-order local maximinity.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
