The author uses energy methods to establish the validity of these approximations and finds that they can be applied to a broad class of ordinary and partial differential equations. The results show that averaging methods can be used on longer time intervals and provide a basis for informed assessment of their usefulness in various physical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
