They analyze the flow structure, focusing on the large aspect ratio limit where nonlinear convective flow occurs near each end of the cavity. The study provides predictions of heat transfer across the cavity and compares them with the results of full numerical simulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
