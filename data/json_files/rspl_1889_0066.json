Thomson", "semantic_tags": ["Magnetism", "Cobalt", "Villari effect", "Magnetic properties of materials", "Pressure effects"], "tldr": "This article investigates the effects of pressure on the magnetisation of cobalt, revealing a critical field where the material's magnetisation changes. The authors found that the Villari effect, a cyclic change in magnetisation due to pressure, occurs in cobalt, similar to iron. The study also examines the relationship between strain and magnetisation, providing insights into the magnetic properties of materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
