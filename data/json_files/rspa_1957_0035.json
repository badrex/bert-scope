They derived heat capacities at constant volume and found that the heat capacities of these liquids vary differently with temperature. The results provide insights into the molecular motion and structure of liquids, contributing to the understanding of the liquid state of matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
