They found that the direction of the changing dipole moment in the crystals could be calculated from simple measurements of optical density of the absorption bands. The results agreed with the crystal structures derived from X-ray spectra when the usual assumptions about angles were made. This method can be used as an adjunct to X-ray methods for crystal structure determination.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
