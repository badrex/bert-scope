The authors used multiple parallel assays to determine the rank order of opioid peptides and found that endogenous opioid peptides interact with at least two different receptor sites. They also studied the effectiveness of naloxone as an antagonist and the cross-reactivity between and receptors. This research contributes to the understanding of the role of opioid receptors in the nervous system and their potential applications in treating pain and addiction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
