They used a combination of methods, including measuring the relative lowering of the solutions' vapour pressures and direct osmotic equilibrium pressures. The results provided valuable data for understanding osmotic phenomena and the behavior of these solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solutions and Colloids"}
