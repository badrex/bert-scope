They found that the mfr was highly conserved and amplified in several lineages of perciform fishes, providing reliable phylogenetic information. The study's findings agreed with other hypotheses based on morphological, mitochondrial, and anonymous nuclear DNA. The authors developed versatile PCR primers for population-level work in many groups of perciform fishes, including cichlids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Genetics"}
