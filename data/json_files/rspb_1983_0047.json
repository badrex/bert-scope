The results show that exocytosis occurs in response to micromolar calcium concentrations and is unaffected by drugs that interfere with the normal function of microfilaments and microtubules. Trifluoperazine, an antagonist of the calcium-dependent regulatory protein calmodulin, inhibits exocytosis in vitro.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
