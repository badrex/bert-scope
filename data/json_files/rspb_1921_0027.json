They investigated the effects of dilute mineral acids and bicarbonates on the rate of bubble formation. The study found that water plants cannot actively split bicarbonates in solution, and the bubble-counting method can be used to study the impact of various substances on plant assimilation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
