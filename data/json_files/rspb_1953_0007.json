They found that the increased carbon dioxide production in the after-effect was derived from two main sources: the oxidation of lactic acid and the respiration of sugar. The results confirm previous observations and provide further insight into the metabolic pathways in plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
