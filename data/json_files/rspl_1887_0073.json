Mucilage is a slimy substance that helps keep the young fern buds moist and prevents excessive transpiration. The authors find that mucilage secretion occurs intraprotoplasmically and that the mature cells are full of the secretion, which forms drops containing gum mucilage and embedded gum droplets. The process of secretion is similar in both types of ferns, although the structure of the mucilage cells and the appearance of the secretion differ.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
