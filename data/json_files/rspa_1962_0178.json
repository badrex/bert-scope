They found that dissolved oxygen reduces the Overhauser effect and that the effect of the solvent on nuclear polarization is influenced by molecular interactions. The power dependence and radical concentration also play a role in the Overhauser effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
