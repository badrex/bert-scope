They explain how atmospheric agitation can cause indistinctness in telescope images and propose that the apparent indistinctness of Mercury's and the Sun's limbs during previous transits was due to atmospheric turbulence rather than a \"luminous crown\" or circle of aberration. The author also provides a comparison between refracting and reflecting telescopes, explaining why the effects of atmospheric turbulence are more noticeable in reflecting telescopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Telescope Design and Atmospheric Effects"}
