The author presents a method of successive approximations to determine the boundary of the turbulent region and the components of velocity within it. The study provides insights into the behavior of turbulent wakes and their implications for fluid dynamics and aerodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
