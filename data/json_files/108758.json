They analyzed the physical and chemical characteristics of the resin and its constituents, including solubility, color, and reaction with various substances. The authors found that Sycoretin is a neutral resin with unique properties, and it cannot be classified with glucosides or other organic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
