The experiments reveal that the combustion products include phenols, peroxides, and aldehydes. The authors propose a mechanism for the main combustion reaction, which involves the degradation of the side chain and benzene nucleus, followed by the rapid degradation of the resulting aliphatic aldehyde, yielding formaldehyde and the ultimate combustion products, carbon monoxide, and carbon dioxide. The results provide insights into the complex nature of combustion products and the factors affecting their formation and survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
