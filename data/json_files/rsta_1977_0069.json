The authors develop mathematical models and computer programs to analyze the various erosion processes, such as impact crater formation, solar wind sputtering, and catastrophic rupture. They also examine the microparticle flux and its recent time dependence, considering possible sources like comets and impact comminution particles within 1 AU. The study provides insights into the erosion processes and probable meteoroid influx rates on the lunar surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Geophysics"}
