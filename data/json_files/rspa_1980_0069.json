It highlights the contributions of Sir Charles Frank and Sir Nevill Mott, who independently came up with the idea of the Frank-Read source, which is a process that preserves and multiplies dislocations in crystals. The article also explains how their ideas were influenced by the work of other scientists and how they eventually collaborated to publish a joint paper on the topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
