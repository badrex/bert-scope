They focus on the use of planktonic Foraminifera, which are sensitive to temperature changes and secrete calcareous shells. The authors describe essential conditions for core selection, such as a constant rate of sedimentation and minimal disturbance, and discuss the significance of their findings for understanding past climate changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
