The authors found that the percentage of total mineral matter decreases in the entire body as animals mature. They also discovered that the ash composition varies between different animal types, with pigs having a lower percentage of lime and a higher percentage of potash and soda compared to ruminants. The study provides valuable insights into the chemical composition of animal food and its impact on human nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Food Chemistry"}
