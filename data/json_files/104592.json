He shares his observations of temperature changes and the state of the barometer, emphasizing the need for better understanding of weather phenomena. This knowledge can help compare the state of the air in different places and improve our understanding of heat and cold extremes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
