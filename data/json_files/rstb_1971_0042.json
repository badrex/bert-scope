It explores improvements in vitrification, fracture processes, and the use of antifreeze agents and high-pressure freezing to overcome limitations and extend the method's range to molecular dimensions. The double-replica method is introduced to evaluate artifacts and provide insight into membrane splitting.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Microscopy"}
