They found that weak acids and bases were more lethal in lower ionic concentrations, and that the lethal effect of different substances was related to their periodic group in the periodic table. This research helps to understand the toxic effects of various substances on living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Toxicology"}
