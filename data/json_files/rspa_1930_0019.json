They tested the accuracy of their method with clays and bentonite, and discussed its application to various chemical and physiological processes, such as buffering of acids by proteins and chemical reactions of blood with gases. The study aimed to improve the sensitivity and accuracy of rapid flow calorimetry for measuring the heat developed in chemical reactions."}
