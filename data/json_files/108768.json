They developed a method using a saturation gauge to measure the exact temperature at which water is completely vaporized, overcoming the challenges of previous experiments. Their findings contribute to understanding the behavior of steam and its applications in steam engines and other industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
