They found that the energy decreases progressively as the difference of crystal orientation decreases. The results support the 'transitional lattice' theory of the crystal boundary and are consistent with Shockley and Read's theoretical predictions based on a dislocation model of the transition boundary.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
