The author explains that these oncogenes alter the differentiation program of the infected erythroid precursor cells, resulting in hormone-independent leukemia cells. The study focuses on the role of the erb B protein, a truncated version of the EGF receptor, in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
