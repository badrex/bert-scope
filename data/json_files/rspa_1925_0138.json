The authors found that the reaction rate is directly proportional to the partial pressure of oxygen and carbon monoxide. They also discuss the limitations of Langmuir's theory and suggest that the mechanism of the process is more complex, involving deeply occluded gases and adsorbed monomolecular films on the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
