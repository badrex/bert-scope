The research focuses on the development of teeth in teleost fishes, specifically the formation of cap enameloid and collar enameloid. The study provides insights into the role of the inner dental epithelium and odontoblasts in the formation and mineralization of enameloid matrix.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Vertebrate Anatomy and Development"}
