The ions were accelerated in the Birmingham cyclotron, and their average charges and the dependence of ionic charge on velocity and atomic number were studied. The results showed good qualitative agreement with Lamb's criterion and provided insights into the influence of ion velocity and atomic number on the charge carried by an ion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear and Particle Physics"}
