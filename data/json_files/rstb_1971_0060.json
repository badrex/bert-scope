They find that these granules contain proteins similar to those found in adrenal chromaffin granules, suggesting a possible storage role for chromogranin A in sympathetic nerves. The release of chromogranin A and noradrenaline together during the secretory response supports the idea that these proteins are involved in the process of synaptic transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
