It compares the similarities and differences between a peripheral nervous site, the superior cervical sympathetic ganglion, and a central nervous site, the septal nuclei. The study examines the process of synapse formation and restoration after injury, highlighting the differences in regeneration between peripheral and central nervous systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
