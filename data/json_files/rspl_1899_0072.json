The research focuses on isolating the organisms through culture, studying their staining reactions, and examining their morphological characters. The findings contribute to understanding the role of blastomycetes in cancer development and the tumor microenvironment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
