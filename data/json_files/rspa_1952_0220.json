They found that the ions influence the water structure around the ionic charge, and the effect of the ionic charge on the rigidity of the hydrocarbon chain and solvent structure play a significant role in determining the entropy and heat capacity changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
