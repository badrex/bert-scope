They found that the spectra of metals in each group are similar to one another and differ from those of other groups, with the positions of lines changing systematically with increasing atomic mass. This study aimed to discover the laws governing the distribution of lines in spectra and the relations between the physical and chemical properties of metals and their spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
