They explain that the Society does not directly manage the printing but recommends reviving it when necessary. They also emphasize that the Society does not give opinions on subjects presented to them and that the thanks given to authors are a matter of civility. Lastly, they discourage crediting reports and public notices as a representation of the Society's approval.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
