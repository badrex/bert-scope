They discuss the relativistic invariance of the commutation relations and provide a modified form of the equations of Dirac, Fock, and Podolsky. The author also introduces negative-energy states for photons and eliminates the longitudinal part of the field in the new electrodynamics of Dirac.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
