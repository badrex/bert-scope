He explains how the lungs expand and contract due to their elastic properties and how this contributes to respiration. Carson also describes the structure and function of the windpipe, lungs, and diaphragm, and how they work together to support life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
