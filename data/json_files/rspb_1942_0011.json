They found that the 4-hydroxyphenyl group is essential for maximum activity in this type of compound. The study also showed that the a-naphthyl group, when replacing the 4-hydroxyphenyl group, only produces weak oestrogenic activity. The research suggests that further investigation of the effect of nuclear substitution on the benzene ring is needed to improve the potency of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
