Tyndall, examines the vibrations and tones produced by the contact of bodies with different temperatures. He tests the theories of previous researchers, such as Prof. Forbes, and conducts experiments to challenge their claims. Tyndall discovers that vibrations do not only occur between substances of different natures and that the third general law proposed by Prof. Forbes is not valid. He also shows that bismuth and antimony, considered inert metals by Prof. Forbes, can produce distinct tones.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
