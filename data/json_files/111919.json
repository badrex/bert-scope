They discovered that the heating effect in voltaic batteries occurs at the positive pole, while in induction coils, it occurs at the negative pole. The author found that the medium through which the discharges pass does not explain the phenomenon, and the cause of the heating remains a subject of further investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
