The author, James D. Forbes, examines previous research and conducts his own observations to determine the relationship between the thickness of the atmosphere and the absorption of solar rays. He concludes that the absorption diminishes as the thickness of the atmosphere increases, and that there is a limit to the amount of absorption that can occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
