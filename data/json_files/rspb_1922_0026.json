The authors found that an increase in carbon dioxide levels can diminish or annul the retarded coagulation of peptone blood. They also discovered that the liver may not be the only organ responsible for producing antithrombin, as previously believed. This challenges the common understanding of the cause of non-coagulability of blood after peptone injection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
