They found that porphyrins are stronger bases than previously thought, with two protons being added to the nitrogen atoms as the pH decreases. They determined pK'a values for various porphyrins and discussed the relationship between these values and thermodynamic dissociation constants. The study also explored the effect of different substituents on basicity and proposed possible structures for the free bases and cations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
