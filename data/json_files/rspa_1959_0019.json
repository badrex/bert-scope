They derive the continuity equation and boundary conditions, and provide solutions for the steady state and temporal growth in various exact and approximate forms. The study considers secondary cathode processes due to fluorescent light and the general case with additional diffusion processes and secondary cathode action.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
