They demonstrate that the Hall conductance of a magnetic Bloch band is given by the quantized phase winding number, and they establish that a weak periodic potential splits each Landau band into subbands whose conductances sum to unity and satisfy a Diophantine equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
