The atomic weight of radium was found to be 226.2, which was determined through a series of experiments and careful extraction methods. This research helped clarify the place of radium in the system of elements and its relation to other elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Nuclear Chemistry"}
