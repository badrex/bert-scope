They found that some substances, such as fluorescent dyes and screens, absorbed R\u00f6ntgen rays more selectively than others, like glass and tinfoil. This evidence suggests that R\u00f6ntgen rays are not all of one kind and may be heterogeneous in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
