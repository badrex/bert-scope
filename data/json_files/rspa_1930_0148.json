The authors describe their experimental setup and findings, which show that the heat loss from a solid surface is proportional to the pressure and the difference in temperature between the gas and the solid. They also discuss the importance of maintaining a clean solid surface for accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
