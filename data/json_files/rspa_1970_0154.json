They used a simple electron-ion recombination model to show that dose kinetics measure the rate of trapping of electrons and derived quantitative expressions for various trapping conditions. The experimental observations were found to be in agreement with the theoretical equations. The study provides insights into the physical behavior of electron traps in polyethylene and helps understand the thermoluminescence process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
