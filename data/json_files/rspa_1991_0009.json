The proof uses the Brunn-Minkowski inequality and parametrized indicator measures, and it generalizes Taylor's result to unbounded sets. The Wulff theorem is important for understanding phase transitions and the behavior of materials with complex surface energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometric Measure Theory"}
