The author suggests that the loss may be due to chemical reactions between the water's components, leading to the formation of sediment and the disappearance of medicinal virtues. The author proposes further experiments to test this hypothesis and explore the role of chemical reactions in the loss of water properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
