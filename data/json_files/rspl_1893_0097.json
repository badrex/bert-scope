They found that sugar, when taken as food, increases the amount of muscular work done and retards the onset of fatigue. The study suggests that sugar could be added to the daily diet of working individuals to improve their muscular power.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nutrition and Metabolism"}
