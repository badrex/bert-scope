This eruption produced a variety of pyroclastic deposits, including two plinian pumice falls, three phreatomagmatic ashes, and several ignimbrite flow units. The vent was located within a lake, and magma-water interaction played a significant role in the eruption's style. The Taupo eruption's complexity and size make it difficult to accurately forecast future eruptions from the Taupo Volcanic Centre.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Volcanology"}
