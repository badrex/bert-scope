Pauli's research on the quantum theory of atoms and atomic spectra led to the discovery of the exclusion principle, which states that no two electrons can be found in equivalent orbits. This principle helped explain the structure of complex atoms and the periodic system, and it remains a fundamental concept in modern physics."}
