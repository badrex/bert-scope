They discovered that the decomposition of an equivalent of water was accompanied by the decomposition of an exact equivalent of sulfate of soda. This research provided insights into the nature of compound electrolytes and secondary chemical combinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
