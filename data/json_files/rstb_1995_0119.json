Hox genes are a subfamily of homeobox genes that play a crucial role in defining the identity of segments in arthropods. The author explains how Hox genes control the structure of segments and how their differential deployment between segments provides a model for the basis of segment diversity. Comparing Hox gene deployment between insects and a crustacean suggests a novel model for the derivation of the insect body plan.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
