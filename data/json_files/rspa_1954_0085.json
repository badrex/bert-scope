The high heat flow discovered is unexpected and suggests a heat flow from the Earth's interior towards the surface. This study has implications for understanding geological processes and the differences in heat flow beneath continents and oceans.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geothermal Heat Flow"}
