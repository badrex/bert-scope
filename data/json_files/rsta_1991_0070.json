The authors propose a model that explains how vortices interact with the wall layer and contribute to the cyclic behavior of turbulent surface flows. They also discuss the importance of understanding these dynamics for potential control and drag reduction methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
