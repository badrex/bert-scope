He finds that nitrous oxide is heavier than the impurities likely to be contained in it and calculates its density. The results show a discrepancy with previous findings, leading Rayleigh to continue his research using liquid air to further purify the gas. He hopes to determine the ratio of molecular weights according to Avogadro's rule in future work.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
