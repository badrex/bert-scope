They discuss the factors affecting coil efficiency, such as the shape of the coil, power dissipation, and the effect of heating on the coil. The authors also explain the source of power and the methods used to determine the maximum field attainable.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromagnetism"}
