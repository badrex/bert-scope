The cell walls contain microfibrils of xylan, while the cuticle is mainly composed of mannan. The structure of these polysaccharides and their arrangement in the cell walls provide insights into the growth and development of the alga.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Algae Biology"}
