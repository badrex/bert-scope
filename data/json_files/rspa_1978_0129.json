They use a method originally devised by Lord Rayleigh and present experimental results for the body-centred cubic lattice of perfectly conducting spheres, confirming the theory. The study also discusses the problem of disordered arrays of spheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
