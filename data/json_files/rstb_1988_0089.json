The research describes the ultrastructural morphogenesis of individual receptive segments, including the growth of microvilli and the development of light-guiding properties in rhabdomeres of Layer I. The findings contribute to understanding the evolution and function of the complex photoreceptor mosaics in these spiders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
