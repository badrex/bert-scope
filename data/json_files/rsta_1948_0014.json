The results show that compression reduces the induction period and lowers the threshold temperature for detonation, increasing the sensitiveness to heat. The phenomenon of 'dead-pressing' of mercury fulminate is also discussed, which involves a decrease in sensitiveness to external stimuli but an increase in sensitiveness to uniform heating. The study provides valuable information on the 'trigger mechanisms' controlling the onset of detonation under various circumstances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
