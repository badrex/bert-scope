They studied the equimolar mixtures of benzene-toluene, toluene-para-xylene, and benzene-para-xylene, finding that the heat of mixing is less than 0.2 kJ/mol. The results provide insights into the temperature dependence of heats of mixing in liquid mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
