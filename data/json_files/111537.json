He refutes Prof. Kolliker's view that smooth muscle is made up of fusiform cells and instead suggests that the bladder's muscular substance is composed of lengthened fibers with fixed and tendinous terminal attachments. He also distinguishes between two types of \"corpuscles\" in the muscular tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
