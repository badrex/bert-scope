The research focuses on how these antelopes lose water mainly by panting and how they conserve water in hot and arid environments. The findings show that the dik-dik's efficient kidneys and low-water exchange help them inhabit hot arid areas. The respiratory tract plays a major role in dissipating excess heat in these antelopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
