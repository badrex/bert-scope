They used a plethysmograph to measure pulmonary ventilation and found that the decrease in oxy-hemoglobin levels during chloroform narcosis was not due to a slowing of respiration but rather to the direct interference of chloroform with the oxygen transport function of red blood cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Respiratory System"}
