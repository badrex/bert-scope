This finding contradicted the belief that the variation was constantly changing everywhere. Robertson's discovery was significant for navigation and boundary disputes in Jamaica, as it provided a reliable method for determining the true meridian and the accuracy of land surveys.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
