They found that reinnervation significantly reduced the amount of Schwann cell outwandering compared to non-reinnervated nerves. This discovery sheds light on the complex relationship between nerve fibers and Schwann cell migration, which is crucial for understanding nerve regeneration and repair.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
