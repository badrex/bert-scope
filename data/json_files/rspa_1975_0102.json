A theoretical condition for deflexion of the crack is derived, and the results are supported by direct observation of a crack traveling through a transparent rubber block to meet an adhesive interface with identical material. The effects of crack speed, depth, and modulus changes along the crack path are also examined.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
