They discovered that the photoionization cross-section has a maximum at the series limit and falls smoothly to around 0.1 Mb at higher energies. Above 87,000 cm\u207b\u00b9, the absorption cross-section curve is dominated by autoionization lines. These findings provide insights into the interaction of radiation with atoms and molecules, which is significant in astrophysics, aeronomy, and plasma physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
