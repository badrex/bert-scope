This article describes its appearance, habitat, and seasonal behavior. The fish is similar to a trout but has a slimy texture and is found in lakes and pools at the foot of Snowden. They appear during winter and are in short supply, making them a delicacy. The author also mentions a pool in his parish called Quellyn, where the Charr-Fish can be found after Christmas and sometimes even in midsummer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish biology"}
