They find that most of the enzyme domains are variations and extensions of a basic theme of a many-stranded, predominantly parallel beta-sheet surrounded by alpha-helices. The study also reveals strong structural similarities between some of the enzymes, which may have evolved from a common ancestor.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
