The authors evaluate the cross-section for the production of bremsstrahlung during the collision and find that the radiative corrections improve the accuracy of the Mossl\u030cller formula for electron scattering and the Bhabha formula for positron scattering. The results provide a test of quantum electrodynamics in physical situations involving large transfers of momentum for the electron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
