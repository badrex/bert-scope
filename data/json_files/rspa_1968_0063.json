It demonstrates that solitary or periodic waves have a maximum height with sharp crests, and waves that are sufficiently asymmetric break into bores. The study provides insight into the breaking of water waves and the conditions required for such breaking to occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
