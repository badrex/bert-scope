They used low-temperature alinement and -ray spectroscopy to analyze the hyperfine structure of the ionic ground state and the nuclear disintegration scheme of 2. The results suggest that the lowest ionic state in the double nitrate lattice is a singlet, and alinement arises through a pseudo-quadrupole mechanism. The decay scheme was confirmed by analyzing the -ray spectrum and determining the cut-off energy and half-life of the isotopes."}
