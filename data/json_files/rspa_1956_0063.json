The author explains how uneven temperature distribution and cooling can cause plastic deformation in crystals, leading to dislocations and other defects. The study is particularly relevant to semiconductors like silicon and germanium, as their properties are significantly affected by the presence of defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystal Growth and Defects"}
