The authors investigate certain analytical solutions that simulate aspects of ingot solidification, such as inward solidification of a liquid half-space with varying wall temperatures or Newton cooling at the wall. They also discuss other approximate analytical approaches and briefly mention a computer procedure for solving these problems. A two-dimensional mathematical model of ingot solidification is developed, and numerical solutions are given for ingots with varying mould surface geometry and composition. The results are in good agreement with radioisotope tracer tests performed at the British Steel Corporation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Metallurgy"}
