The specific dynamic action (sda) response was found to be low and on a longer timescale than previous sda responses. The metabolic scope was restricted, with a peak metabolic rate 1.64 times higher than the pre-feeding basal metabolic rate. The study shows that L. uva uses protein almost exclusively to fuel metabolism, indicating an adaptation to its low energy lifestyle in the Antarctic environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
