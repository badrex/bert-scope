He found no evidence of any optical changes or projections on Mars' disk during the observation. South concluded that either a physical change has occurred in Mars' atmosphere or the accuracy of the observations made by Cassini and Roemer must be considered unreliable.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
