They discovered that failure by fatigue and failure under static stresses have similar changes in the crystalline structure, including dislocation of grains, formation of crystallites, and lattice distortion. The authors also found that specimens subjected to safe ranges of stress exhibit no appreciable progressive change in their structure, providing a criterion to distinguish between safe and unsafe stress ranges.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fatigue of Metals"}
