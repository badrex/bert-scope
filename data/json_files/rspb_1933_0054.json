They discovered that the rate of recovery heat production corresponds to the rate of initial heat production, and the ratio of total to initial heat is significantly higher when recovery is followed for a longer period. This research provides insights into the efficiency of the recovery process in nerve activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
