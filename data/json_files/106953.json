He observed differences in the decomposition process between animal substances obtained from quadrupeds and humans. The author also discussed the potential applications of this fatty matter, such as using it as an article of commerce and its possible connection to steatomatous tumors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
