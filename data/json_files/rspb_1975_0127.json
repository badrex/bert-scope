The enzyme activity released is mainly AChE-5, which is identical to the soluble isoenzyme present in splanchnic nerve trunks and one of the five soluble isoenzymes in the adrenal medulla. The study demonstrates that the adrenal medulla can secrete AChE.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurochemistry"}
