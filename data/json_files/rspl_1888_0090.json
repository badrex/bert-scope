They found that carbonic anhydride had the most destructive influence on the microorganisms, while hydrogen had the least impact. The results suggest that microorganisms may reach their maximum activity when the gaseous products they produce are removed by an indifferent gas like hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
