The authors found that magnetization has a small effect on the extent of the corrosive action of copper salts on iron and steel. They also studied the spectra of flames, particularly those of organometallic compounds, and observed that the vibrations in the flames may be due to chemical changes and not just high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Corrosion Science"}
