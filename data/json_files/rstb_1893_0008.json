They prepared and analyzed various nitrites, including methyl, ethyl, primary and secondary propyl, primary and secondary butyl, iso-butyl, tertiary butyl, alpha-iso-amyl, beta-iso-amyl, and tertiary amyl nitrites. They found that the nitrites' action on blood pressure, pulse, respiration, and striated muscular fiber was influenced by the different chemical structures of the nitrites. This study aimed to provide valuable pharmacological results and insights into the treatment of diseases."}
