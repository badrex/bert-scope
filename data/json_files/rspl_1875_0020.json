They discovered that sound can be intensified at the surface of water under specific atmospheric conditions, such as a temperature gradient with colder air near the surface. This phenomenon can explain the increased audibility of sounds over long distances in certain situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
