It explains the process of ultrafiltration, the factors affecting it, and the role of ultrafilter membranes in fractionating disperse systems and estimating the size of dispersed particles. The author also describes the structure of ultrafilter membranes, the factors influencing filtration, and the importance of surface equilibria, internal equilibria, and adsorption in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
