It examines the effects of pituitary removal and the relationship between the pituitary gland, calcium, and magnesium metabolism. The results show that hypophysectomized animals have a lower calcium content than normal ones, while the magnesium content remains similar. The study suggests that the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland plays a significant role in these metabolic changes and is associated with the activity of the ovaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
