They show that different gauge transformations produce different forms of Hamiltonians, and they focus on the transformations that result in the Coulomb-gauge and Power-Zienau-Woolley Hamiltonians. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the physical significance of the Hamiltonian after the unitary transformation has been made.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
