He analyzed the osteological characters and relations of these fossils, comparing them to existing species of Saurian reptiles. The Iguanodon was determined to be herbivorous, and its unique bone structure suggests it fed on the foliage and trunks of ferns in its environment. These specimens are now housed in the British Museum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
