This response involved an initial depolarization followed by a delayed spike, which was abolished by removing external calcium or adding cobalt or D-600. The study suggests that calcium entry might be associated with a step between membrane depolarization and muscle contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
