They also discussed the taxonomic system of Copeland and Holttum, analyzing the implications of their findings for understanding the evolutionary history of ferns in different climates and environments. This study provides valuable insights into the taxonomy and cytology of ferns, contributing to the broader understanding of their biology and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
