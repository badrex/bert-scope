They found that the mass spectrum of the natural material resembled that of diethyl ether, but it was unlikely that diethyl ether was the active compound. The study provided insights into the possible structure and properties of the chemotactic material, but further research is needed to identify the active principle.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
