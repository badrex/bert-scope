They found that no obvious correlation exists between radiation resistance and thermal stability, mechanical sensitivity, or ignition temperature. The results indicate that explosives can be ordered with respect to their resistance to radiation-induced decomposition, and that radiation resistance is imparted to molecules with benzenoid resonance. However, exceptions to this rule were observed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nuclear Chemistry"}
