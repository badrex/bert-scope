They found that metals initially strain-harden during the early cycles of deformation, but this hardening eventually levels off, indicating non-hardening plastic strain. The researchers also discovered that the total plastic strain that can be achieved without fracture in the non-hardening stage is much higher than in static deformation. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of fatigue and the behavior of metals under cyclic loading.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
