The study considers a machine with parallel magnet cores, uniform sections, and armature bobbins with iron cores. The author discusses two extreme cases to determine the coefficient of self-induction and the electromotive force.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromagnetic Induction"}
