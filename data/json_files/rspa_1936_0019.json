The authors, K. Mitchell and R. H. Fowler, discuss the interaction of electromagnetic radiation with metal surfaces and the resulting emission of electrons. They apply quantum mechanical principles to explain the observed phenomena and provide a deeper understanding of the underlying processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
