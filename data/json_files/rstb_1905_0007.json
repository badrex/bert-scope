They find that the symptoms produced by these venoms are similar to those caused by cobra venom, and that Calmette's antivenin may be effective against them. The study also examines the haemolytic action of the venoms and their effects on blood pressure and respiratory curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
