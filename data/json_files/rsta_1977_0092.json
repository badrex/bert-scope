It discusses the positions of epicenters of shallow moonquakes and compares them with surface phenomena like lunar transient phenomena. The study suggests that while there are similarities between the types of sites for deep moonquakes and surface phenomena, the great depths of moonquakes make a direct one-to-one correspondence unlikely. The article also examines the possibility of gas flow shaping channels into pipes and the connection between tuffsite and kimberlite pipes on Earth and the Moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Seismology"}
