The authors focus on steady, two-dimensional flow and explore the effects of rotation and translation of cylinders in the presence of fixed walls. They also discuss the limitations of the \"slow-motion\" treatment and the potential of more advanced methods, such as the stream function and the principle of successive reflections.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
