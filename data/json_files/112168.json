Frankland and B. F. Duppa, conducted experiments to synthesize various ethers from acetic ethers. They discovered two new compounds, ethylic diethacetone carbonate and diethylated acetone, and described their properties, including their solubility, density, and reactions with other chemicals. These findings contribute to the understanding of ether synthesis and the properties of acetone derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
