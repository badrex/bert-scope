They find that the leading-order contribution to Hawking's integral is the energy density of matter, while in the absence of matter, the dominant contribution is the Bel-Robinson tensor, which can be viewed as a measure of gravitational energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
