The authors describe an experimental and analytical method to measure the reaction force and contact compliance, allowing them to deduce the material properties, such as the Young's modulus and yield stress, which are consistent with data obtained from conventional mechanical testing methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
