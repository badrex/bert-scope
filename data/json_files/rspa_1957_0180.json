The authors consider various temperature ranges and electric fields, finding that interelectronic collisions play a significant role in determining the electron distribution function, even at low electron densities. The study also reveals that the calculation by Yamashita and Watanabe only applies to a limited temperature range.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
