They found that the amount of lithium transformed to the low-temperature phase is not significantly increased by cooling below 30 K, while the amount of sodium transformed is increased. The specific heats of the separated b.c.c. and h.c.p. phases of sodium were deduced, with Debye temperatures of about 90 and 60 K, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
