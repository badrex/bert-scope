The foetus was a result of a pregnancy attended by dropsy of the uterus. The author provides a detailed account of the foetus's anatomy, including the presence of a larynx-like structure, rudimentary limbs, and a mass of unformed tissue in place of the head. The article also discusses the absence of the digestive system organs and the presence of a unique kidney-like structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
