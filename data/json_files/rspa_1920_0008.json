The instrument uses an electromagnet with a silicon alloy core and a method that directly measures the force exerted by the magnet. This new method provides greater sensitivity and practical advantages for measuring magnetic fields in rock samples. The author's work contributes to geophysical surveys and understanding the magnetic properties of rocks."}
