By satisfying the boundary conditions more accurately, the authors find an increase in drop deformation, which partially explains the discrepancy between theory and experiment. However, the smallness of an expansion parameter limits the reduction of this discrepancy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
