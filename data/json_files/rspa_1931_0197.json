The authors developed a transpiration method using a glass capillary and mercury to measure the mass of gas flowing through the capillary under a pressure gradient. The results provide insights into the behavior of gases under high pressure and their viscosity-density relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
