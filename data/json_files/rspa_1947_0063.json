They found that various phases, such as MnAl6, Tx, MnAl4, T2, and MnAl3, can crystallize as primary constituents. The phase Tx, characterized by a ratio of four aluminum atoms to one of combined solutes, plays a significant role in this system. The study provides insights into the formation of intermetallic compounds and their equilibrium relations in the aluminum-manganese-zinc system.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
