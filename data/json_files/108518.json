They discovered that the nuclei of cells, called cytoblasts, aggregate and adhere together, forming elongated masses that eventually become muscular fibers. This finding contradicts the previous belief that the cells involved in muscle development were blood cells. The author's observations were made on fetal pigs and confirmed through examinations of other mammals, including calves, lambs, goats, rabbits, rats, and humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
