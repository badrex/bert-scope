The authors analyze the conditions under which exponential assemblies can be used for this purpose and discuss the results in terms of thermal neutron extrapolation lengths. The study shows that absorption of thermal neutrons accounts for a significant portion of the total effect in different control rod materials, and the sensitivity of the method is comparable to measurements on critical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
