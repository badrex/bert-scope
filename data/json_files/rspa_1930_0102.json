The researchers found that the equivalent height of the ionized regions varied with time and location, and they discovered that 100-meter waves could penetrate the lower ionized region during certain times of the day. This research helped to improve our understanding of wireless propagation and the behavior of the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
