His work on slip bands and the plastic deformation of metals laid the foundation for future research in the field. Rosenhain also played a crucial role in establishing the Department of Metallurgy and Metallurgical Chemistry at the National Physical Laboratory, where he led important research projects and developed new alloys and materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
