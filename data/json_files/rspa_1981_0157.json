The authors derive the effective interaction Hamiltonian and explore the case of small but finite distances using the numerical solution of a Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The results demonstrate the involvement of surface states weakly bound to the material surface, providing insights into the properties of the system and the inadequacy of perturbative techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
