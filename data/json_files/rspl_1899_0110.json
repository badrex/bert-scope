The experiment aimed to test whether using liquid air as a cooling agent could introduce new impurities or errors in the measurement of gas density. The results showed no significant difference in the weights, indicating that liquid air desiccation is a viable method for measuring gas density.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
