They found that spermine oxidase is present in ruminants, while benzylamine oxidase has a wider distribution. The development of these enzymes in newborns is not dependent on rumen development and function. The plasma oxidases differ from intracellular amine oxidase in their substrate specificity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
