He explains the use of a brass scale with fine gold-disk divisions and a marble slab for accurate comparisons. The process involved minimizing errors from the thickness of the bar and maintaining consistent temperature for precise measurements. The results show that the distance from 0 to 36 on the Royal Society's scale is equal to 35.99938 inches of the Imperial Standard Yard.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metrology"}
