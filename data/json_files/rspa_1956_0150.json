They introduce a metric to measure distances in the dislocated state and discuss the implications of using a metric with a specific connection. The study focuses on the compatibility equations for finite strains and the relationship between dislocation density and shape strain in crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
