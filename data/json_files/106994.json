They discovered that the adjustment is produced by three changes in the eye: an increase in the curvature of the cornea, an elongation of the axis of vision, and a motion of the crystalline lens. These changes depend mainly on the contraction of the four straight muscles of the eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
