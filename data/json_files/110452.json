They found that tides are affected by local causes and not by general irregularities, which confirms the exact determination of tides with local meteorological corrections. The author also discovered that the amount of flexure in tides is not the same at different places, and that the discrepancies in the curve representing the tidal inequalities for different places can be reconciled by introducing a local, in addition to the general, semimenstrual inequality. The tide hour varies rapidly around main promontories and slowly along bay shores, which affects the cotidal lines and the differences in tide levels and velocities.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Coastal Geophysics"}
