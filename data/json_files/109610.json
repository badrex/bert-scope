He compared Saturn's shape to that of Jupiter and found differences in their figures. He also measured the dimensions of Saturn's figure and provided a corrected drawing. These observations may help understand the matter in Saturn's ring and the effect of gravity on planetary figures.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
