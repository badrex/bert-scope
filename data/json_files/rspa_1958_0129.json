They found that the absorption of light in the crystal results in the production of excitons, which dissociate into free electrons and positive holes, leading to the initiation of the decomposition process. The primary photocurrent was found to be proportional to the strength of the applied electric field, and the activation energy for photoconductivity was measured as 0.36 eV.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
