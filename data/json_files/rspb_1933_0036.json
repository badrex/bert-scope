The researchers found that the movement of growth substance is polar, with it passing to the lower side and increasing growth, causing upward curvature. The substance is thermostable, lipoid-soluble, and has a high molecular weight. It is active in very high dilutions, and its effects on plant growth are studied using automatic motion picture cameras.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
