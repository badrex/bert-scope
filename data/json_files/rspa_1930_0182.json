They found that hydrogen promotes the combustion of carbonic oxide more readily than oxygen. The results suggest that hydrogen peroxide, formed during the combustion process, plays a crucial role in the oxidation of carbonic oxide. The study provides insights into the mechanism of cathodic combustion and the role of hydrogen, steam, and metal particles in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame Chemistry"}
