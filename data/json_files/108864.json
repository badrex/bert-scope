The author, John Frederick William Herschel, compiled this catalogue to serve as a general index for astronomers and to help identify new objects as they are discovered. The catalogue includes the work of his father, William Herschel, as well as other notable astronomers like Messier, LaCaille, and Auwers. The author also discusses the challenges and methods involved in creating this catalogue, including the reduction of observations to a common epoch and the identification of errors in nomenclature.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
