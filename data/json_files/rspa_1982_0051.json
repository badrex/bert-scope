The model, composed solely of -B2O3 triangles with no boroxol rings, had calculated scattering properties that agreed well with experimental X-ray and neutron data. The model's density was 17% higher than the experimental value, which could be reduced by incorporating a small proportion of boroxol units.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Glass Science"}
