The spectra are presented to assist in the analysis of combustion products and to identify a band characteristic of the peroxide group. Most peroxides have bands of medium intensity in the region 10.5 to 12 microns. The study provides evidence regarding the association in acyl and alkyl hydroperoxide, and the possible molecular structures of organic peroxides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
