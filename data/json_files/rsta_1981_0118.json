It highlights the interaction of endogenic and exogenic processes, the effects of changes in solar radiation, and the influence of biological evolution on the crust. The circulation of meteoric water and sea water through continental rocks and mid-ocean ridges play a significant role in the formation of hydrothermal ore deposits and volcanogenic sulphide deposits, respectively. The article also emphasizes the importance of weathering, transport, and deposition in shaping the Earth's crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
