They used three methods to measure the intensity of the bands and found that the rotational line intensity, partial band intensity, and peak band intensity methods provided consistent results. The study aimed to establish accurate band strengths and oscillator strengths for the Swan system, which is essential for diagnostic interpretation in various fields like astrophysics, gas dynamics, and atmospheric studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
