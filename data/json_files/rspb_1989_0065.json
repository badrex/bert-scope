The results show intense immunoreactivity at the axon membrane at nodes of Ranvier and variable reactivity within nodal axoplasm. Additionally, sodium channel-related immunoreactivity was present within perinodal astrocyte processes, suggesting an active role for these cells in the aggregation of sodium channels within the axon membrane at the node of Ranvier.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
