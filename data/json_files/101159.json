He discovered that blood consists of tiny red globules, bones are made up of transparent globules, and tissues are composed of very fine filaments and cells. These observations provided a deeper understanding of the structure and composition of living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
