They discuss recent research on plant electricity and explore the distribution of electrical tension on the leaf's surface. The study also investigates the electrical phenomena resulting from excitation and the mechanisms behind the leaf's movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
