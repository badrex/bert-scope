It explores how protein sequences can reveal the history and ancestry of organisms, and how this information can aid in understanding early selective breeding and the development of agriculture. The article also highlights the potential of ancient protein material, such as collagen and keratin, for studying the ancestry of plants and animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
