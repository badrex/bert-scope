They propose that the Moon's surface has been significantly altered by meteorite bombardment and suggest that the maria floors consist of fragmented material. The authors also debate the Moon's interior structure, temperatures, and origin, considering various theories and evidence from past discussions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
