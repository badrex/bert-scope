They find that its stem structure and vascular system are consistent with Monocotyledons, and its growth is through the continuous development of a terminal bud. The absence of a fibrous layer and the composition of the vascular bundles are discussed, providing evidence in favor of the Nymphaeaceae family being Monocotyledons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
