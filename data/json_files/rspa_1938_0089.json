They find that the polished surface exhibits a pattern of two diffuse haloes, which suggests that the polish layer is \"almost amorphous.\" The authors discuss various theories and experiments related to the structure of the polish layer and propose a method to further study its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
