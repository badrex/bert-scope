They discovered that the aluminium surface forms a protective oxide film, which affects the rate of hydrogen diffusion. The researchers also found that the rate of diffusion is the same for both freshly scraped and anodically oxidized surfaces, suggesting that the oxide film plays a significant role in the diffusion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
