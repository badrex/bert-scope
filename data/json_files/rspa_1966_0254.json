They calculate the second-order matrix and discuss direct and exchange interactions, including retardation effects. The Breit operator is introduced for both direct and exchange interactions, and the authors analyze the spin-spin, spin-dipole, spin-orbit, and dipole-dipole interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
