They discovered that the cells have a unique structure that allows for efficient gas exchange and circulation. The author also found that the current theory of respiration, which involves decarbonizing the blood, does not align with the anatomy and physiology of the lungs. Instead, they propose a simpler process where oxygen and carbon are exchanged through the lungs and carried to the heart.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
