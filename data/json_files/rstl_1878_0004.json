The reaction also produces other compounds, such as hexyl acetate, hexene, and a ketone. The author also discusses the decomposition of these products during distillation and the formation of other compounds, such as heptyl bromide and heptyl alcohol.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
