They find that no exponentially growing 'normal modes' occur, but since the exponentially decaying modes' completeness has not been proven and there are normal modes with real frequencies, the stability of Kerr space-time has not been established rigorously.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
