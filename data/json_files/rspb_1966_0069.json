The NLT reaction is an immunological response against the antigens of the recipient organism. The research explores the reaction's phases, the effectiveness of immunosuppressive agents, and the relationship between the NLT reaction and homograft reactions. The findings have implications for understanding the immune system and potential applications in immunosuppression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
