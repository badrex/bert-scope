They found that about 20% of the exothermic reaction energy appears as vibrational energy in oxygen. The authors also investigated the mechanism for the production of superexcited oxygen and measured the absolute populations of the excited levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
