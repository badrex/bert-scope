They introduced mercury vapour into an ionisation tube and used a combination of electric fields and positive ray analysis to study the ionisation process and the nature of the ions formed. This method provided more complete information about ionisation and atomic structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Structure and Spectroscopy"}
