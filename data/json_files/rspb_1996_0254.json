They found that by inhibiting nitric oxide synthase, the octopus was unable to learn to distinguish between black and white balls. This study highlights the importance of nitric oxide in various learning and memory processes in both vertebrate and invertebrate animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
