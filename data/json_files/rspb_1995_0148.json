It introduces a game theoretical approach to dynamic optimization, considering organisms as players in a cooperative game. The optimal strategy is characterized as an evolutionarily stable strategy for a constant environment game, maximizing the fitness of the genotype as a whole. The study provides a framework for understanding and predicting the behavior of organisms in unpredictable environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
