They explain the distribution of tides in the North Sea based on the effects of friction, depth, and the Earth's rotation. Their findings provide a better understanding of tidal patterns and help improve the accuracy of tidal predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
