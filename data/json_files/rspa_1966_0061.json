The author presents field measurements and data processing techniques using a four-element array of three-component seismometers. The results suggest that improvements in wave signal-to-noise ratios are possible, and the method offers promise for identifying small seismic events.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
