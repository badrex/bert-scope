The vorticity distribution is effectively stationary in time due to a balance between vorticity production and concentration by the turbulent shear and vorticity diffusion through viscosity. The author computes spectrum functions for two types of shear fields and compares them with experimental data, finding a better fit for plane shear, which produces a vortex sheet. This hypothesis has implications for the applicability of the Heisenberg form for turbulent energy transfer."}
