It explores the selectivity of insecticides, the potential for genetically modifying beneficial organisms to resist pesticides, and the use of semiochemicals to improve the efficiency of entomophagous pathogens. Additionally, the article highlights the prospects of genetically manipulating crop plants to enhance predation and parasitism of pests.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
