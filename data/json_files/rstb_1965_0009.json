The research examines mortality, integumentary characters, growth, fin regeneration, freshwater adaptation, liver reserves, fat stores, and hematological parameters in intact, hypophysectomized, and hypophysectomized fish with pituitary transplants. The results show that the ectopic pituitary transplant in this fish secretes thyrotropin, adrenocorticotropin, and prolactin-like hormone, but does not secrete growth hormone or gonadotropin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
