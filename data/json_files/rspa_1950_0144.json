The results show that the values of polarizability are not very sensitive to the choice of wave-function, suggesting that the LCAO treatment may provide reliable results for other systems, including the hydrogen molecule. The predicted variation of polarizability with internuclear distance agrees approximately with previous calculations, but further experimental data is needed for comparison.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
