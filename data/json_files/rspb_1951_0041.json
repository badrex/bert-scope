The research shows that a direct linear relationship exists between epidermal mitotic activity and oxygen tension, and adequate glucose levels are necessary for mitosis to occur. The findings suggest that energy produced aerobically is important for epidermal cell division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
