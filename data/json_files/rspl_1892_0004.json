They found that removing a portion of the kidney caused minimal immediate effects, but removing both kidneys led to significant nutritional disturbances, including extreme wasting, increased urine production, and a rise in nitrogenous extractions in the tissues. This research provided valuable insights into the importance of healthy kidneys for overall health and well-being.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
