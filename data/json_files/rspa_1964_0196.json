They discovered systematic stratification and bands of enhanced electron density aligned with the geomagnetic field, which suggests that the geomagnetic field plays an important role in the mechanism of production of these enhancements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ionosphere"}
