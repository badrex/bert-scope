The arthropod's unique features, such as its tubular carapace and telson with three large flukes, are discussed. Although the cephalic region's poor preservation leaves its affinities uncertain, it shows the greatest similarity to the branchiopod Crustacea. The classification of Odaraia in the family Odaraidae is vindicated, but its relation to higher taxa remains to be determined.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
