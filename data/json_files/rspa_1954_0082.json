The authors explain how the density of rocks beneath the ocean is higher than those beneath the continents, and how the Mohorovicic discontinuity is shallower under the ocean. They also explore the role of turbidity currents in shaping the ocean floor and suggest further research methods, such as echo sounding and seismic work, to better understand the ocean's structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
