They find that these molecules influence neurite outgrowth and form, suggesting a key role in neuronal development and regeneration. Laminin and tenascin are present in the leech extracellular matrix and have structurally similar but not identical properties to their vertebrate counterparts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
