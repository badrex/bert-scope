They discovered that the cool flame spectrum has a more distinct band structure and lacks the OH bands found in normal flames. The strong sodium emission in cool flames suggests that atoms take up energy directly from the combustion process, which questions the reliability of the sodium-line reversal method for measuring flame temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
