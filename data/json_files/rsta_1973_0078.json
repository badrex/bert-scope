They discovered that complete equilibrium is rarely attained, and two composite hysteresis loops exist in the regions occupied by the (121) and (132) crystallographic shear structure families. The findings provide insights into the thermodynamics and structure of inorganic solids, particularly those that exhibit non-stoichiometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
