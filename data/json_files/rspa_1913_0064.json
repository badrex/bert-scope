They discover that the discharge potential is significantly reduced when a magnetic field is applied, and they propose a spiral path for electrons in the presence of both electric and magnetic forces. This explanation helps to understand the decrease in voltage drop at the cathode and the overall behavior of the discharge phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
