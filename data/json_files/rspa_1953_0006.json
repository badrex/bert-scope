They used a proportional counter to detect the emitted particles and found that the total cross-section for the two reactions is the same within 1%, but the angular distributions of the products are significantly different. This research is important for understanding nuclear reactions and the potential applications in nuclear energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
