The author explains the role of HPr and FPr proteins in the phosphoenolpyruvate-dependent phosphotransferase (PT) system, which is responsible for the uptake and phosphorylation of fructose. The study also highlights the differences between the fructose enzyme II and other enzymes II in the PT-system, emphasizing the uniqueness of the fructose transport system in E. coli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
