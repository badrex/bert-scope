They found that the apparent heat capacity of intra-crystalline water is higher than that of liquid water, and the heat of sorption is approximately 14 to 15 kcal mole-1. The infra-red absorption spectrum of the system revealed that each sorbed water molecule is hydrogen bonded to the aluminosilicate through both hydrogen atoms. The clustering of water molecules, presumably by mutual hydrogen bonding, causes the broadening of the absorption band, which becomes similar to that in liquid water when each cage is filled with a cluster of 21 water molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics and Surface Chemistry"}
