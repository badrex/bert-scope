They discovered that these gases have a distinct minimum solubility and that solubility increases with increasing atomic weight. The study also found that helium and neon have nearly equal solubilities, suggesting that one of the determinations may be incorrect.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
