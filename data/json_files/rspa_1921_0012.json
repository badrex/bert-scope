They observed the presence of various particles and the Brownian movement in these systems, which helped them understand the viscosity and composition of soap solutions. The authors also discussed the limitations of different ultramicroscopes used in their experiments and the importance of using cinematography to study the life history of particles and formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
