The text discusses Fatio De Duillier's ideas on gravity, which were seen by the author on March 19, 1689/90, at Gresham College. The author prefers the oldest version of the text, as it is closer to Fatio De Duillier's communication to the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitation"}
