T. Desaguliers, conducted experiments to determine if there was any difference between the electricity of glass and that of gums and resins. He used a cat-gut string, a silken thread with a feather, and various materials like wax and glass tubes. The experiments showed that both glass and gums and resins could exhibit electrical properties, and the behavior of the materials when electrified was studied in detail.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
