The authors extend previous work on stress and displacement fields at transverse cracks in isotropic and orthotropic media to the case when the crack tip terminates on a transversely isotropic-orthotropic bimaterial interface. They obtain general solutions for the crack tip stress singularities and corresponding stress intensity factors for both in-plane (mode II) and out-of-plane (mode III) shear loading. The results show that stress singularities can be weaker or stronger than the inverse square root singularity for an isotropic material, depending on the ply angle and geometry of the constraining orthotropic sublaminates.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
