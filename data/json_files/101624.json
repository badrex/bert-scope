He discovered that ants can stain flowers with this juice, which he compares to other acidic substances like oil of vitriol. Wray also explores potential uses for this juice, such as creating dyes and tinctures, and suggests further research on its properties and applications in medicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acidic substances and their applications"}
