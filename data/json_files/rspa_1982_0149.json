They find that the wavefunction can be expressed as a partial wave expansion in spherical polar coordinates with Legendre polynomials as the angular functions and radial functions including polynomials and exponential integral functions. This solution can be extended to the eigenvalue problem and other higher-order perturbation equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
