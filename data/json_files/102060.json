The bridge, built by the Romans, has a unique and crooked design, with wide arches and uneven angles. Robinson discusses the potential use of this design in building bridges in Yorkshire, where streams are often torrents with rocky bottoms, making pile driving difficult.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Civil Engineering"}
