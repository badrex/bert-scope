The authors analyze earthquake records from various regions and find that the annual period has a maximum epoch in winter, while the semi-annual period has varying maximum epochs depending on the region. The study also discusses the connection between seismic periodicity and barometric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
