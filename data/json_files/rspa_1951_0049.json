They determined the evaporation coefficient and diffusion coefficient of molecules in air, which could provide insights into phase transformations in solids. The results showed that the rate of evaporation has the same temperature coefficient as the vapour pressure, and the heat of activation for the rate of evaporation is 23,890 mole.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
