The authors demonstrate that a stratified shelf current passing through an area of intense tidal mixing can inject nutrients and create a larger area of high phytoplankton production throughout the summer. This process is significant for understanding the fluctuations in fish recruitment and the overall productivity of the continental shelf seas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
