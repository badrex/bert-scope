The authors used a magnetic deflection method to measure the straggling of rays in mica and found that the energies of the particles are symmetrically distributed about a mean value. The results show a steady increase in the decrease of velocity and agree with Rutherford's law. The authors also discuss the ratio of singly to doubly charged particles and the rate of loss of energy of particles in relation to the ionization produced by them.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
