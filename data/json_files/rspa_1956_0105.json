They found that the hydrogen bonds linking neighboring molecules consist of \"long bonds\" with the proton closer to one oxygen atom than the other. The study provides a more accurate location of hydrogen atoms in the molecule compared to X-ray diffraction methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
