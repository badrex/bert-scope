The author identifies three dominant lines in the boron spectrum and explores the methods used to prepare and analyze the element. The properties of solid boron, such as its extreme hardness and rise in electric conductivity with temperature, are also examined.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
