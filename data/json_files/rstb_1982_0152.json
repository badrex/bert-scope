The authors use various experimental techniques, including electrophysiology and ion uptake measurements, to understand how chloride ions move across cell membranes. They find that chloride ions are transported through specialized channels and that the transport is influenced by the concentration gradient and the presence of other ions in the surrounding environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Physiology"}
