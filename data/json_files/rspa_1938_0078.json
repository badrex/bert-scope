The author assumes a more general form for the energy function, considering ellipsoidal surfaces of constant energy instead of spherical ones. The calculations are then applied to determine the diamagnetic moment for isotropic and anisotropic cases, providing a better understanding of bismuth's magnetic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
