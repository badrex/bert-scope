It is found that larval release occurs almost entirely during daylight, with light being the primary inducing factor. Tidal oscillation has a secondary effect on larval release by controlling ambient light intensity. The daily pattern of larval release changes between unimodality and bimodality according to the amplitude and timing of low tide in relation to photoperiod.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
