The authors apply this method to a simple lattice composed of equal numbers of two types of atoms and compare it with previous methods like Bethe's method. The quasi-chemical method provides a more powerful and convenient approach to understanding the behavior of super-lattices and other types of lattices with long-range order.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
