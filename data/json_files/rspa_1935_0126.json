They discovered that the magnetostriction in bismuth crystals is anisotropic and depends on the direction of the applied magnetic field. This study provides a better understanding of the anomalous behavior of bismuth and contributes to the development of new materials and technologies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
