These discoveries challenge the belief that humans did not exist until after the latest geological changes and the extinction of large mammals. The author presents evidence from various locations, including Abbeville, Amiens, and Brixham Cave, to support the idea that these tools were made by early humans and were entombed with the remains of extinct animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Archaeology"}
