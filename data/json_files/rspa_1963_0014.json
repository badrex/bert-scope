The authors analyze the absorption and fluorescence spectra of mixed crystals, considering the effects of intermolecular forces and the influence of host-guest interactions on the electronic properties of the crystals. The study provides a theoretical framework for understanding the behavior of mixed crystals and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
