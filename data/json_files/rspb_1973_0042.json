The receptor consists of a strand with dendrites of up to 80 bipolar nerve cells. The sensory cells can be divided into movement-sensitive and position-sensitive cells. The structure and function of the scolopidia, which contain the dendritic terminations of sensory neurons, are examined in detail. The research provides insights into the mechanisms of proprioception in arthropods and the role of the PD proprioceptor in monitoring joint movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
