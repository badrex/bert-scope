The author demonstrates that natural selection influences the correlation between organs and is likely the primary factor in the production of correlation. The study uses mathematical formulas and statistical methods to analyze the effects of selection on the correlation and variability of organs in different populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
