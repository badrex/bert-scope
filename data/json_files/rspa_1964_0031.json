They used a model for a globular protein to estimate the electrostatic contributions to the free energy and enthalpy of ionization, showing that the observed differences can be accounted for by the different electrostatic interactions. This study provides insights into the thermodynamics of ionizations of abnormal haemoglobin forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
