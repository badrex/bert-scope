They discovered that an axillary bud's anodic position is influenced by a repelling force originating from an older leaf primordium. This phenomenon explains the large angles between successive leaves, as the anodic axillary bud encroaches on the space available for the next leaf, affecting its position and divergence angle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
