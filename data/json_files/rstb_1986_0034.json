The author discusses the various ways trees interact with each other, such as through resource depletion zones and the hierarchy of dominance-suppression. The importance of recognizing neighboring modules and their effects on growth and form is emphasized for both modular animals and plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
