They analyze the forces acting on the mass and the changes in its shape due to solidification and rotation. The study aims to generalize the theory of the Earth's figure and understand the geological and physical actions that have occurred during its transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
