The technique helps in understanding the effects of residual elements and additives on the properties of steel, such as toughness, corrosion resistance, and life. The method requires uncontaminated intergranularly focused X-ray facilities for accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
