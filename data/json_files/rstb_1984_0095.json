This study aimed to investigate the genomic level of various forms of C1q and understand the possible relation between C1q genes and procollagen genes. The findings could help clarify the genetic defect involved in immune-complex-related nephritic disease and provide insights into the comparison between C1q genes and procollagen genes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
