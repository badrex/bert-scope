They investigated various eye types, including \"red,\" \"black no-white,\" \"albino,\" and \"colourless,\" and analyzed the relationship between the eyes and the central nervous system. The research also explored pigment migration in the retinula and its role in protecting receptor elements in different light intensities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
