They derive a formal solution for the velocity of a surface point at any time, which helps explain the differences observed in seismograms, such as sharp and blunt arrivals of waves. The research focuses on the relationship between pulses and their travel times, providing insights into the behavior of sound waves in a compressible medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
