The tensor is given explicitly in terms of two scalar Green's function potentials, each obeying its own wave equation. The study explores the symmetries and reciprocity properties of the Green's tensor and quantifies the effect of gradients of constitutive parameters on the radiation fields of electric and magnetic multipoles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
