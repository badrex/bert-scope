The authors investigate the efficiency of fluorescent excitation and the probability of internal conversion in argon atoms ionized by characteristic radiations of copper, molybdenum, and tungsten. The results provide insights into the behavior of atoms and the mechanisms of internal conversion and fluorescent radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
