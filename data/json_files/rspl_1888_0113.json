They developed a new chronographic measurement method to accurately measure time intervals, which allowed them to analyze the acceleration period of explosions. The paper focuses on the methods used to minimize errors in the measurements and the potential applications of this research in understanding explosion mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas dynamics and explosion mechanics"}
