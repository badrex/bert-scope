They observed that the yield stress decreased with plastic strain in all experiments, and the maximum strengths were higher than previously calculated values. The results suggest that dislocation generation in small volumes may involve a source mechanism other than the Frank-Read type.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
