Norman Lockyer, conducted spectroscopic observations of the Sun and discovered that the solar spectrum contains the spectrum of hydrogen. He also found that the chromosphere and prominences are composed of hydrogen and other elements like sodium, magnesium, and barium. The study of the solar spectrum and its lines provided insights into the physical constitution and pressures of the outer limits of the solar atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
