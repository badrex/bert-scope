The authors examine ice cores from Camp Century, Greenland, and Bird Station, Antarctica, and discuss the challenges in interpreting isotopic data and dating ice cores. They find evidence of warmer climate conditions before the onset of the last ice age and identify periods of colder conditions throughout the Devensian stage.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
