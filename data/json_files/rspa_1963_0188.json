It explores the factors that influence the strength of solids, such as stress concentration, strain concentration, and the role of plasticity in both ductile and brittle fractures. The author also examines the role of crystallography in the fracture of crystalline solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
