He discovered that the bright lines in the spectra were due to the volatilization of compounds of the metals with oxygen. The author also found similarities in the spectra of earths and alkali metals, suggesting a connection between their chemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
