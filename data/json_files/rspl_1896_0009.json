They discovered that the presence of silver in the alloy helps in creating a uniform distribution of gold, making it easier to estimate the value of the ingots. The study suggests that when the base metal content does not exceed 30%, silver can dissolve it and form a uniform alloy with gold.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
