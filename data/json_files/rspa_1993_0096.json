They discuss the design and functionality of the zero-field polarimeter CRYOPAD, which uses the Meissner effect to separate magnetic fields and analyze scattered neutron polarizations. The technique has applications in magnetic structure determination and can help overcome limitations of previous uniaxial polarization analysis methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
