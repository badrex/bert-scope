The author suggests that the cause of these anomalies lies in the interchange between lower and higher atmospheric strata, driven by convection currents resulting from the daily heating of the Earth's surface. The study also explores the impact of these anomalies on wind direction, velocity, and seasonal weather patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
