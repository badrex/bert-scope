The authors found that the activity of radium decreases with increasing temperature, and they concluded that the equilibrium quantity of radium C at high temperatures is less than normal. This study provides insights into the behavior of radioactive substances and their transformation products under different temperature conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
