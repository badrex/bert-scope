The study focuses on the critical points where the curvature of the surface is infinite, and the flow becomes unstable. The author also discusses the application of the hodograph method to obtain new solutions and the numerical work involved in evaluating slowly convergent series.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
