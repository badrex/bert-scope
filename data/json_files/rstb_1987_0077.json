The cdc2 and cdclO gene functions are essential for the cell to traverse \"start\" and proceed from G1 into S-phase. The molecular functions of these genes have been investigated, with cdc2 being shown to be a protein kinase, suggesting that phosphorylation may play a role in controlling the transition from G1 to S-phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
