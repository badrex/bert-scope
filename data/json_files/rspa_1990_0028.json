The researchers used a phase-Doppler anemometry technique to measure the velocity and size of droplets in both non-reacting and reacting flows. The results provide insights into the combustion of kerosene droplets in furnace-type burners and help guide calculation methods for heterogeneous combustion. The findings can be used to scale the response of droplets to air motion in other flows through dimensionless numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Combustion and Fuel Engineering"}
