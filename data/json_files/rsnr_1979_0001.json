The author discusses the connection between Newton's alchemical work, his exposure to mercury vapors, and the symptoms of erethism, a form of mercury poisoning. The article suggests that further research is needed to establish a clear link between Newton's health problems and mercury exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
