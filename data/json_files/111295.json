The study found that blood combines with oxygen in two ways: by giving off carbon and directly combining with oxygen. This research supports the idea that the blood's color, hematin, plays a significant role in absorbing oxygen and exhaling carbon dioxide, which is different from Liebig's hypothesis that iron in the blood-hematin is responsible for this process."}
