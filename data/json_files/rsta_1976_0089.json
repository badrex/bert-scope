They used a superconducting solenoid magnet to study the Zeeman effect and measured wavelengths and wavenumbers using thorium standards. The research provides a better understanding of europium's electronic energy-level structure and identifies new levels based on both the 4f and 6s6p configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
