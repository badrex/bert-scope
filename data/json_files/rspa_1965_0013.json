The authors introduce a general least-squares procedure for estimating treatment effects and provide a framework for analyzing experiments with linear treatment models and orthogonal block structures. The method is applicable to various types of factorial experiments and can be extended to include quadratic and higher-order terms in independent variables.", "scientific_discipline": "Statistics > Experimental Design"}
