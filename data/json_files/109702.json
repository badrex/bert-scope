He found that Cheshire salt is generally purer than foreign bay-salt and that the differences in properties among salt varieties are mainly due to their mechanical properties, such as crystal size and compactness, rather than their chemical composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
