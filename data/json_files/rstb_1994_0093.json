The authors demonstrate that the necessity for efficient water transport systems constrained the evolution of land plants, similar to the problems of gravity and reproduction/fertilization. They analyze the water budget and water transport problems of the earliest land plants, focusing on the evolution of the protostele, a central water-conducting structure found in early vascular plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
