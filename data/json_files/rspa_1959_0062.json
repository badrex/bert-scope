They used two lattice dynamical models, the Begbie & Born nearest-neighbour non-central force model and the central force model by Leighton. The method provides more accurate results for specific heats, thermal expansion coefficients, and other thermal properties of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
