He worked with Sir William Ramsay on the vapour pressures of solids and liquids and later focused on improving distillation methods for separating mixed liquids. His work on fractional distillation and azeotropic mixtures has had lasting impacts on the field of chemistry and is still used today.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics and Distillation"}
