Instead, they exhibit interesting features in lattice spacings and atomic distribution. A superlattice forms in certain ranges, with aluminium atoms segregating into definite positions. This study provides a detailed quantitative analysis of these lines and sheds light on the stages by which the superlattice is built up.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Formation"}
