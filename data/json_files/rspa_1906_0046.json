H. Walter, developed a method to obtain continuous unidirectional currents from a magnetic detector of the self-restoring type. This method uses a magnetic mass undergoing reversals of magnetism in the magnetic field of the generator, which generates a unidirectional electromotive force (EMF). The generated EMFs are equal and opposite, resulting in a continuous unidirectional current during the time that oscillations act upon the magnetic mass. This discovery could improve telephonic reception and rapid recording work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
