Pigott's observations were used to correct the inaccuracies in maps of the region, which were found to have significant errors in the positioning of towns and the width of the channel. The article also highlights the dangers and challenges faced by ships navigating the area, as well as the need for more accurate maps and astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geographical Mapping"}
