The author, George Gilpin, provides a detailed account of the instruments used and the method he employed to analyze the data. The results show the variation in the compass direction and the dip of the magnetic needle over time, with a summary of the findings for each month. Comparing Gilpin's observations with those of Henry Cavendish from 1775, the mean annual decrease in the dip is calculated to be 4f1.3, and the progressive annual decrease is 1'4 on average.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
