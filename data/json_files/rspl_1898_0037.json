They find that the open packing of atoms in these metals supports the phenomenon of solid solution, and the absorption of hydrogen by palladium demonstrates this concept. The study provides insights into the dimensions of the hydrogen atom and the relationship between crystal structure and hydrogen absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
