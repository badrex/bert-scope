They discovered a unique mechanism of gametogenesis in irregular polyploid species, maintaining the specific somatic number of chromosomes through unequal reduction divisions. This research covers new ground in understanding the processes of embryo-sac formation in the Tribe Rosae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
