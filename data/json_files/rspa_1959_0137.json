They propose a model to explain the observed resistance minimum and thermopower anomalies, which could be caused by the distortion of the Fermi surface due to impurities. The study suggests that the addition of impurities to copper causes the Fermi surface to pull away from the zone boundary, leading to changes in the residual resistance and other transport properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
