They found that sexual populations can evolve and adapt rapidly enough to overcome the two-fold reproductive disadvantage of male production, challenging the hypothesis that sexual individuals cannot evolve quickly enough to compensate for the cost of males before being eliminated by asexual competitors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
