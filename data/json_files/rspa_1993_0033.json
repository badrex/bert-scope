They introduce a geometrical consideration of the algebraic constraint that the Fourier transforms of these solutions must satisfy in the transform domain. This approach allows them to design classes of solutions with better localization properties, including subluminal and superluminal waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave Equations"}
