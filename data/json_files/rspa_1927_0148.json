They found that detonation takes place earlier with increasing pressure, but only up to a certain limiting pressure. The mixtures' velocities behave similarly with the rise of pressure, and the authors discovered a vibratory type of combustion associated with a \"knock\" sound. The results suggest that detonation is not solely dependent on adiabatic ignition and mechanical compression but also requires a certain reaction rate."}
