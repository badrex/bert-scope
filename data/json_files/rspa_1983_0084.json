The research explores the stability of rectified currents, which are slowly varying in the zonal direction and can be excited by weak steady or unsteady localized forcing. The findings suggest that non-parallel effects play a significant role in the dynamics of large-scale geophysical flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
