They determined the quadrupole interactions of nuclei at and lattice sites relative to the substituted impurity. The results were compared with a simple ionic model, and the best agreement with the experiment was found when using the shell model modification of Dick (1966) to the Tessman, Kahn, and Shockley (1953) ionic polarizabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
