They find a strong correlation between the age of the rocks and the helium ratio, suggesting that the Earth is around 700 million years old. The study also discusses the possibility of other minerals, such as beryl, undergoing a similar process of crystallization that concentrates helium.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochronology"}
