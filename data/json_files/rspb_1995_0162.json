It finds that even in polygynous species, worker and queen relatedness are surprisingly high. The reproductive skew does not significantly affect the genetic structure of the colonies. The results suggest that high relatedness and high skew may be mutually reinforcing, but it does not necessarily mean that high relatedness causes high skew.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
