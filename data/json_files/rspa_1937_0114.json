They developed a new method to determine the isotherms and the coexistence line, which allowed them to study the behavior of CO2 near the critical point. The results showed that the empirical law of Matthias, for the rectilinear diameter, holds even in the neighborhood of the critical point. The authors also determined the latent heat and the position of the critical point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
