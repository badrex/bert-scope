The author finds that a powerful afterglow is obtained when there is a minimum of water vapor in the gas phase and a maximum amount of water vapor adsorbed on the glass surfaces. The study also shows that the presence of nitrogen in oxygen is essential for the afterglow to occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
