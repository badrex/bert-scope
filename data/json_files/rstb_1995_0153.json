It explains how the Sry gene, present on the Y chromosome, determines whether an embryo develops as male or female by triggering the testicular pathway. The author also examines the expression of Sry during critical stages of genital ridge development and its interaction with DNA through an HMG box DNA binding domain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Developmental Biology"}
