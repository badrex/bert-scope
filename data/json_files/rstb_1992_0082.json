They can differentiate objects based on angular size in a vertical plane and range in a horizontal plane. This study demonstrates that bees can use this information to accurately estimate the size of objects in both vertical and horizontal planes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
