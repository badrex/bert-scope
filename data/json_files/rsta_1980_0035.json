Satellite Doppler tracking is presented as a crucial method for determining position and reconciling different coordinate systems. The example of the Frigg Gas Field in the North Sea demonstrates how the United Kingdom and Norway resolved the geodetic problem of reconciling geodetic and Doppler data to establish an equitable division of the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
