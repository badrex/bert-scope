They discuss the relativistic quantum mechanics of a single electron in a central field and the expectation value of the energy in a many-electron system. The electrostatic and magnetic interactions between electrons are considered, and the authors calculate the ionization energy in neutral mercury as an example application.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
