They discovered that these amoeboid cells actively participate in the transference and assimilation of food materials, including fats, by migrating into the lacteals and breaking down, releasing nutrients into the chyle. This process is not limited to fats, as other substances can also be conveyed in a similar manner.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
