They measured the isotropic and anisotropic exchange interactions between the ions, providing insights into the antiferromagnetic properties of the concentrated salts. The results were used in the spin wave theory to predict the magnetic ordering and showed a satisfactory agreement with experimental findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
