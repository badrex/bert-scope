They derive equations of motion for the body, which are consistent with the conservation of total charge, total momentum, and total angular momentum (spin). The authors also investigate the uniqueness of the chosen set of moments and simplify the equations of motion using the multipole approximation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
