They propose that earth currents are induced and secondary phenomena, not the direct cause of magnetic disturbances. The author also suggests that changes in the magnetism of the earth, as observed through magnetograph peaks and hollows, may be due to variations in the disturbing force.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
