The study reveals that the distortions in the excited states of CH4+ and NH3 (excited state) are large, while those in CF4+ and NH3 (excited state) are much smaller. The authors determine the equilibrium configurations and potential energy changes due to linear variations in the normal coordinates, providing insights into the molecular vibrations and electronic states of these molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum chemistry"}
