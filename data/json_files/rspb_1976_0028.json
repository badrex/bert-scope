The eye's anatomy, including thin corneal facets, large crystalline cones, and long retinula cells, indicates high visual acuity. The clear zone in the eye allows for light to be guided by the retinula cell column, and a distal collection of rhabdom microvilli acts as a filter for light, potentially aiding in the regeneration of visual pigments. This study provides insight into the diverse anatomy of clear zone eyes and the potential functions of the unique ommatidium in mayflies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
