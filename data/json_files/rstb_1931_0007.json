They collected a large number of fossil plants and animals from the plant-bearing beds and compared the assemblage to other Lower Carboniferous floras. The authors also described the morphology and structure of D. teilianum, including its pinnate fronds and unique branching patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
