The authors compare theoretical predictions from various models, including finite-element approximations and lubrication approximations, with experimental measurements of free-surface profiles. They find that a lubrication approximation accounting for surface tension and inertial effects provides a good representation of the experimental results for a broader range of Reynolds numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
