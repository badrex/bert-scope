The diatom's life cycle involves a size reduction and regeneration process linked to sexual reproduction. Environmental factors, such as light conditions, nutrients, and silica availability, play a crucial role in inducing sexual stages in the diatom. The research demonstrates the importance of understanding diatom population dynamics by quantifying events over complete life cycles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
