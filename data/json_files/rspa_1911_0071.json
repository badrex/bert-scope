They discovered that the transformation of the gas into a brown solid occurs in contact with solid surfaces and is accompanied by the evolution of light and heat. The authors also found that the amount of brown solid formed depends on the form of the apparatus and the amount of solid surface the ozoniser product passes over.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Explosives and Gas Chemistry"}
