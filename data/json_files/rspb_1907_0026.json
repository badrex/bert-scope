They discovered that afferent nerves from one muscle can cause reflex relaxation in its antagonist, while also causing reflex contraction in other antagonistic muscles. This phenomenon, called reciprocal innervation, is observed in various muscle groups and plays a crucial role in motor control and coordination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology and Motor Control"}
