They study the first appearance of larval nephridia and the origin of their flame-cells or solenocytes. The research confirms previous findings that larval and permanent nephridia form a continuous series, and that the head-kidneys and the permanent nephridia form one homologous series. The author also discusses the relationship between nephridia and the coelom in annelids, and the possibility of establishing a common basis for the development of flame-cells type of nephridium on embryological evidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
