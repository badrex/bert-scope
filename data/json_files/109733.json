He discovered that belladonna caused a dilatation of the pupil and impaired the eye's ability to adapt to near objects. The experiment also showed that the sympathy between the eyes was actually sympathy of the retina. Additionally, Dr. Wells observed changes in vision due to age, particularly in short-sighted individuals.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
