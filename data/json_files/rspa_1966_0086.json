They discovered that a balance between the electric stress and a variable pressure difference between the inside and outside of the droplet can maintain equilibrium. The authors found a relation between the ratios of conductivity, viscosity, and dielectric constant for the droplet and surrounding fluid that permits the droplet to remain spherical. They also determined criteria for distinguishing between prolate and oblate droplet shapes based on the stress applied to the droplet's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
