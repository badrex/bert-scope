They find that these disturbances are particularly strong during summer and at sunset, and are often associated with atmospheric electrical effects or the approach of storms. The author suggests that these disturbances may be caused by electrical effects produced in the atmosphere due to ionization from solar radiations and the reaction on this ionization by electric stresses in the atmosphere. They also propose that these disturbances may be related to the diurnal variations of the Earth's magnetic field and the efficiency of wireless telegraphy at night.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Electricity"}
