They found that the concentration of chlorine atoms formed during the decomposition passes through a maximum, and this maximum occurs earlier and is greater in magnitude at higher chloropicrin pressures and temperatures. The findings provide an explanation for the behavior of sensitized mixtures and the ignition limits of the reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
