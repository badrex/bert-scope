It introduces the concept of a 'core' structure, which retains the basic folding pattern of related proteins, and explores how the divergence of protein structures is related to the divergence of their amino-acid sequences. The study provides insights into model building of unknown protein structures and has implications for understanding protein evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Structural Biology"}
