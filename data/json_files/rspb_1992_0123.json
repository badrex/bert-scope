They explain how secretory proteins are transported and sorted, and introduce the KDEL receptor, which plays a crucial role in maintaining the function and organization of these organelles. The author also highlights the importance of molecular chaperones, such as hsp70, in the folding process of proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
