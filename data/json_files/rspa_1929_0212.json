They created an optical system with a quartz etalon and a spectrograph to focus interference fringes from a thin liquid film. This method allowed them to measure refractive indices in the ultra-violet region and improve the accuracy of refractive index measurements. The authors tested their method on nicotine and found that it could be used to measure refractive indices with a high degree of accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
