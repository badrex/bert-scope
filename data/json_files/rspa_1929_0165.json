They found that the rate of decrease in pressure of the acetylene was proportional to the pressure, and the velocity constant of the reaction increased with increasing voltage. The number of molecules reacting was of the same order as the number of ions produced by each electron passing through the window of the cathode-ray tube.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
