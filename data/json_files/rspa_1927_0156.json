They found that the mobility of the actinium recoil atom in air saturated with water vapor is sometimes equal to the mobility of the positive air ion under similar conditions. This research is important for understanding the behavior of individual atoms and the role of positive air ions in atomic processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
