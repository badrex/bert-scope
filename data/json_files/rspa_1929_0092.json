They used a modified Rankine's apparatus to distill the substances and determine their driving pressures. The results provided a means to calculate the atomic diameter of monatomic molecules or the mean collision area of polyatomic molecules. The study also discussed the importance of accounting for the coefficient of slipping of molecules in the calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
