The authors analyze recent observations of the directional spectrum and air pressure fluctuations at the sea surface, and they discuss the implications for wave generation theories. They attribute the initial stages of wave generation to air stream turbulence and the main stage of growth to the shear instability mechanism described by Miles. The authors also consider the role of wave breaking and third-order resonant interactions in the highest frequency range.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
