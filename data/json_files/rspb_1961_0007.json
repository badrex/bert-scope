They found that fetal growth was more affected by the presence of other fetuses in the same uterine horn rather than the opposite horn. The study also showed that the traditional theory of prenatal competition for nutrients in the maternal circulation does not fully explain the observed effects on fetal growth. The results support an alternative theory that suggests the main regulating factor is the pressure at which maternal blood is supplied to the placenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
