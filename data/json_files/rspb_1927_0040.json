The researchers found that gamma rays reduce the number of cells in mitosis, with the effect becoming noticeable after a certain threshold of exposure time and intensity. The study also found that the action of gamma rays is not purely cumulative, and there is a minimum threshold of intensity below which a given biological effect will not occur, regardless of exposure time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
