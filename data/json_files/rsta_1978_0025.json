They explore the effects of radioactivity, erosion, and conductive cooling on the temperature distribution and how these factors may have varied with time. The authors also consider the role of plate tectonics in shaping the thermal gradients within the lithosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
