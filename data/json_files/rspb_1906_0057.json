They found that the growth of cancer is influenced by factors such as the age of the mice, the amount of cancerous tissue implanted, and the site of implantation. The study also revealed that cancerous tumors consist of a parenchyma arranged in alveoli, and the growth of these tumors can be studied through repeated implantation and subdivision of the tissue. This research provides valuable insights into the nature of cancer and its potential treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Oncology"}
