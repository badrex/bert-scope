They found that sensibility lasts longer in colder temperatures and that the vital properties of the spinal cord can influence the duration of sensibility in a limb deprived of circulation. These findings challenge previous assumptions about the influence of temperature on vital properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
