Nerves never penetrate the membrane, and they run closely with blood vessels. The author also discovered that nerves and vessels can be stripped off from the muscle fiber, and that the sarcolemma might be composed of capillaries, nerve fibers, and intervening tissue. This study provides important insights into muscle and nerve functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Anatomy"}
