They found that the distribution functions for these gases are far from Maxwellian, and the inclusion of all collision processes is essential for accurate calculations. The derived properties, such as electron mobility, diffusion coefficients, and Townsend coefficients, agree well with experimental and theoretical values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
