The author conducted experiments on three pipes with different curvature ratios and analyzed the results in relation to previous research. The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of fluids in curved pipes, with practical applications in heating and refrigeration systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
