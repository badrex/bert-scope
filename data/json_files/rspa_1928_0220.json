The author analyzes the forces at the wheel-treads and the interaction between the wheel and rail, considering the effects of creepage and the constraints imposed by the frame. The study aims to provide insights into designing locomotives with stable running, even on poor track conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
