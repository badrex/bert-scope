It explores different types of valid randomization schemes, such as complete block designs, resolvable incomplete block designs, and other block structures. The article also highlights the importance of characterizing structures with a valid randomization theory and the challenges in doing so.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics and Statistics"}
