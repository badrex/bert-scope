The author compares and analyzes various theories, including the thermal theory and Raman's quantum effect theory. The study shows that the thermal theory, based on quantum principles, can explain the background scattering of X-rays in crystals, providing a method for determining their dynamical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
