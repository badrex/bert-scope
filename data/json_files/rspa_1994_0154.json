The authors test conjectures related to the resurgence of periodic orbits and the Stokes phenomenon in quantum billiards, using examples such as the harmonic oscillator, particle on a ring, and billiards on a compact surface with constant negative curvature. The results confirm the divergence of the Weyl series and the role of periodic orbits in the behavior of quantum systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Asymptotic Analysis"}
