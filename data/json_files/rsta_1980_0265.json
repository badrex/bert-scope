They perform a linear stability analysis and find that nonlinear effects tend to decrease the growth rate of surface waves, leading to equilibrium amplitude waves. This research contributes to understanding the complex interactions between wind and water surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
