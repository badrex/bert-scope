They developed an apparatus to collect water from the ocean floor and found that the specific gravities and salinities of sea water varied depending on the location and depth. This research contributed to the understanding of ocean chemistry and the factors affecting sea water properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
