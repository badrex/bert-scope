The authors develop a theoretical model that accounts for compaction in the aquitards and show that the total stress is not necessarily uniform in depth. They also discuss the variations of soil parameters due to various forms of cyclic pumping or recharging.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Mechanics"}
