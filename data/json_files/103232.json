He discovered numerous tiny particles on the tongue's surface and inside its pores, which he believed were responsible for the sensation of taste. Van Leeuwenhoek also observed the tongue's structure in different animals, such as oxen and hogs, and found similar particles in their tongues as well.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
