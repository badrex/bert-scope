They developed a simplified experimental procedure to determine the pressure-concentration equilibria and found that each gas is adsorbed by silica gel at 0\u00b0C in amounts directly proportional to the pressure. The results provide insights into how the adsorption of each gas in a binary mixture is affected by the presence of the other.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Surface Chemistry"}
