They found that the frequency response was flat over a range of frequencies from 0.02 to 1 Hz. Cerebellectomy or reversible cooling of the cerebellum caused a significant reduction in low-frequency gain, suggesting that the cerebellum may play a role in integrating vestibular signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
