They found that the transfer constant remains constant, even with the presence of low catalyst concentrations, which opens up the possibility of using catalysts for chain-transfer studies. The authors also tested the initiation mechanism and found that a bimolecular initiation mechanism is more accurate than a unimolecular one.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
