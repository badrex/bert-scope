They describe the bilateral and metameric arrangement of central distributory motor neurons and their connections to ganglionic complexes. The study provides insights into the unique ribbon axons and their role in the starfish's locomotion and muscle control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Echinodermata"}
