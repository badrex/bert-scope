The results show that decapitation causes a significant decrease in carbon dioxide output, which is not due to the abolition of tonus or fall of blood-pressure. The study also indicates that maintaining postural tonus requires very little energy expenditure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology and Respiration Physiology"}
