It highlights the need for a better understanding of physical mechanisms and the development of constitutive equations to relate material behavior to component performance. The authors also emphasize the importance of incorporating biaxial and triaxial stress systems in design and testing.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
