De Luc's Rules for Measuring Heights by the Barometer", "semantic_tags": ["Atmospheric Science", "Barometry", "Thermodynamics", "Temperature Measurement", "Geophysics"], "tldr": "The author, Samuel Horsley, compares M. De Luc's rules for measuring heights using the barometer with theoretical principles. He constructs tables for the effects of heat and cold, making the application of De Luc's rules more efficient. Horsley also explains the equations related to temperature and reduces De Luc's formulas, providing a better understanding of the elastic fluid surrounding the Earth and its role in various natural processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
