The study finds that rhenium carbonyl, when used as a photosensitizer, results in a higher conversion rate of vinyl polymerization compared to manganese carbonyl. The research also discovers a unique dark reaction that persists for several hours after irradiation, leading to high conversions. The findings provide insights into the photochemistry of group metal carbonyls and their potential applications in polymerization processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
