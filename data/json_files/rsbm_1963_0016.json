Travers worked closely with Sir William Ramsay, and their research led to the expansion of the Periodic Table and the understanding of the properties of these rare gases. Travers's contributions to the field of chemistry are still celebrated today.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
