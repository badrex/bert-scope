They find that the fracture zone extends 1500 miles from the coast near Karachi southwestwards to the middle of the Somali Basin, and conclude that the structure underlying the Owen fracture zone is a system of parallel transcurrent faults affecting the ocean floor only, causing a net right-lateral displacement of 170 miles in the axis of the mid-ocean ridge.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
