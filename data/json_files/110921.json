The blow-hole is situated at the top of the porpoise's head, allowing it to breathe while only a small portion of its head is above water. The blow-hole has a muscular tube with pouches that can expand and contract, helping the porpoise maintain buoyancy and sleep while submerged. This adaptation allows the porpoise to breathe easily while remaining mostly underwater.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
