The results show that single blood cells and latex spheres 20\u03bcm in diameter migrate across the streamlines out of the vortex, while larger spheres and aggregates of red cells 30\u03bcm in diameter remain in the vortex at all Reynolds numbers. The findings provide a mechanism for the accumulation and growth of blood cell aggregates in the vortex, which may be relevant to the formation of thrombi in blood vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
