The authors analyze the disappearance of criticality, ignition locus, and bifurcation diagrams of temperature against Rayleigh number. They compare the results with the Semenov model and find that neglecting the species diffusion term provides a conservative approximation to the ignition locus and criticality boundary. The study also classifies different types of bifurcation diagrams of temperature against Rayleigh number.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Porous Media and Groundwater Flow"}
