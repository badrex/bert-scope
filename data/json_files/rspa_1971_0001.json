The research shows the presence of a dominant surface species involving hydrogen bonding between the hydrogen halide molecule and a surface anion. The findings reveal interesting differences in adsorption on fluoride surfaces compared to chloride to iodide surfaces, providing insights into the interactions between adsorbates and alkali halide surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
