The study involves the use of modular equations and differential equations, with a focus on odd numbers and prime values. The author also discusses the cases of cubic and quintic transformations, providing a deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical concepts.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
