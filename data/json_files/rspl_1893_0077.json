The author conducts experiments on excised liver tissue and observes the conversion of glycogen to glucose. They find that the process can be divided into two periods: an early period of rapid conversion and a later period of slow conversion. The rapid conversion appears to be inhibited by destroying the structure of liver cells, suggesting that it is dependent on the vital action of liver protoplasm. The author concludes that the later slow amylolysis is due to the action of a zymin, possibly developed during the disintegration of liver cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
