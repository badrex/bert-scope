They found that glucose was poorly utilized, while ethanol and C4-dicarboxylates like succinate and malate had varying effects on oxygen demand and N2 fixation. The results suggest that the presence of malic enzymes and a pyruvate dehydrogenase complex in bacteroids may influence the response to these substrates."}
