They found that the reaction was of the first order at lower temperatures and higher pressures, transitioning to a second order at higher temperatures and lower pressures. The activation energy for the first-order region was 67 kcal/mol, and for the second-order region, it was 58 kcal/mol. The results suggest that the reaction is largely homogeneous and occurs through a free-radical mechanism, with the initiation step being the dissociation of propane into methyl and ethyl radicals in the second-order region, and the termination step involving the recombination of radicals in the presence of a third body.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
