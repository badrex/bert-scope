Accurate machine-integrations and new series of three-zone models are used to refine calculations and better understand the Earth's internal mass distribution. The author also discusses the importance of considering the Earth's internal properties, which cannot be assumed to be the same as material at low pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
