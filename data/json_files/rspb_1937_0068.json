Auxins regulate plant growth in various ways, including cell elongation, phototropism, and geotropism. In yeast, growth factors play a crucial role in cell division and plasmatic growth. The article also highlights the importance of further research to understand the full potential of these growth factors in plant and yeast growth."}
