They develop analytical methods to recover the speed of sound in an unknown region using measurements from a time-harmonic source and known solutions on a plane interface between two different acoustic media. The study has potential applications in various geophysical situations, such as detecting metallic ore deposits or pipeline locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
