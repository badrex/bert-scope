The results show that orchidectomy causes thymic hypertrophy, enlargement of peripheral lymph nodes, and an increase in spleen size. These findings suggest that testicular hormones have a significant impact on lymphatic tissues throughout life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
