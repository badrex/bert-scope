They focus on the unsaturation electrons and calculate the location of absorption bands, which aligns well with the observed spectrum. This method offers improvements over previous calculations and provides a more accurate representation of the ethylene molecule's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
