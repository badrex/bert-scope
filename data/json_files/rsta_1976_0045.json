The authors explore how these aspects provide information on particle motion in the corona, the large-scale coronal magnetic structure, and the composition and ionization state of the acceleration region. They also analyze the physics behind particle transport, including diffusion, acceleration, and the interplay between magnetic and electric fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
