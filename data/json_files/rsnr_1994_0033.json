It highlights the focus on Boyle's alchemical interests and theological musings, rather than his contributions to the scientific developments of the 17th century. The review also explores the influence of Christian humanism on Boyle's mentality and his detachment from the scientific ferment of his time.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
