They develop a method to analyze the data using Fourier's theorem and periodograms to discover hidden periodicities, particularly focusing on the 11-year period. This method helps to understand the sun's behavior and improve our knowledge of solar physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
