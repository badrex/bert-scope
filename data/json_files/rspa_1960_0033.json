The authors identify and calculate the binding energies of these hyperfragments, providing insights into the properties of hypernuclei and their decay modes. The study contributes to the understanding of hypernuclear interactions and the behavior of hyperons in the nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear and Particle Physics"}
