They discovered unique features in the cetacean ear, such as the tympanic ligament and sigmoid process, which play a crucial role in their hearing. The study also highlights the differences in the external auditory meatus, ear drum, and middle ear structure compared to terrestrial mammals. The cetacean ear is adapted to detect ultra-sonic vibrations, and its unique anatomy allows for better hearing underwater.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
