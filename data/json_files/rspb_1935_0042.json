They focused on the oxidative breakdown of hexose carbohydrate in leaves and tested the accuracy of various analytical methods for detecting glucose, fructose, sucrose, and starch. Their research aimed to understand the connection between the concentration of readily available carbohydrates and the rate of carbon dioxide production in starving leaves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
