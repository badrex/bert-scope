Noble, conducted research on explosives in collaboration with Sir P. Abel. They investigated the transformation and ballistic properties of various powders, focusing mainly on gun-cotton and modern explosives containing gun-cotton as a primary ingredient. They also studied the erosive power of different explosives and the capacity of materials to resist erosion. The research aimed to improve the understanding of modern explosives and their applications in weaponry."}
