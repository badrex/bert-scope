This tooth has a trituberculate structure with a well-developed talonid, which indicates the presence of a definitive protocone in the upper molars. This discovery sheds light on the evolution of mammalian teeth and their adaptation to different diets during the Mesozoic Era.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
