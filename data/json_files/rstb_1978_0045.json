They discovered that the folded DNA is supercoiled and can be relaxed by intercalating ethidium or nicking with DNase I. The DNA loops, about 85,000 base pairs in size, are constrained by protein-DNA and RNA-DNA interactions. The authors propose a model for the folded Drosophila genome, where DNA is constrained into independent supercoiled loops containing an average of 400 nucleosomes per loop. The study provides insights into the molecular architecture of chromatin and its functional units.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
