They found that each bundle of nerve fibers in a nerve root represents a single simple movement and remains distinct in its course to the muscles it supplies. The author also discovered that the group of muscles supplied by any given nerve root can have both flexion and extension movements, and that these movements alternate in consecutive nerve roots. The results of dividing nerve roots showed that the amount of paresis or paralysis produced is proportional to the number of roots divided and that no incoordination is produced in the remaining muscular combinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
