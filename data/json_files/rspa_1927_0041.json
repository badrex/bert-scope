They used a photographic method to record the spectra and found that the intensities of the beta-ray groups were related to the number of particles hitting the plate. This research provided valuable information about the nuclear transitions and the probability of certain stages in the beta-ray disintegration process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
