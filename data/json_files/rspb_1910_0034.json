The researchers found that endotoxins can reduce phagocytic activity and that this action is specific to certain bacteria. The study also shows that endotoxins are resistant to heat and can act as a \"stimulin\" in some cases. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the immune system and the role of bacterial endotoxins in infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
