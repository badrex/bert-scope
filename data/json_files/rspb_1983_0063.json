The researchers discovered two different types of structures in the coccoliths, one in the upper elements and the other in the basal plate. The lower element is a thin, single crystalline sheet of calcite, while the upper element has a more complex structure. The study provides insights into the formation mechanisms of coccoliths and their biomineralization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
