The theory unifies the disciplines of maneuvering, seakeeping, and structural analysis by considering a flexible body moving through a liquid and accounting for forward speed, free surface wave effects, and distortions of the flexible body. The authors illustrate the theory with responses calculated for two different idealized structures, a uniform box beam and a non-beam-like structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
