It shows that the actin genes are activated at the end of gastrulation and that muscle-specific actin genes are expressed in a cell-type specific manner. The study also reveals that the molecular mechanisms controlling embryonic cell determination occur before genes encoding products of terminal differentiation are activated.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
