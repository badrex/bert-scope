They reconstruct the three-dimensional architecture of the apparatus, which has 19 elements, and propose a functional interpretation of how it operated as an integrated set of mouthparts. This discovery provides a template for understanding other conodont taxa and contributes to the study of vertebrate evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobiology"}
