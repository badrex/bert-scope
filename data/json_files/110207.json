They employed methods to ensure the purity of substances and found that 100 parts of chloride of barium correspond to 137*63 parts of the chloride of silver. The real equivalent of barium depends on the equivalent of chlorine, which is not yet satisfactorily determined.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
