They discuss various experimental methods for studying the ionosphere, such as the angle of incidence, wavelength change, and group retardation methods. The authors also review the magneto-ionic theory, which is the most widely used theoretical method for understanding the propagation of electromagnetic waves through the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
