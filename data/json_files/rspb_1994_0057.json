It finds that in areas where the collared flycatcher is dominant, pied flycatcher males have duller colors to avoid interspecific aggression and interference. This suggests that factors related to species recognition may play a role in the evolution of male coloration in these birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
