They identify two sources of inaccuracy: experimental errors in the values and errors due to being finite. The authors provide methods to estimate the accuracy of structure determinations and suggest that by applying these corrections, more accurate values of atomic coordinates may be obtained.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
