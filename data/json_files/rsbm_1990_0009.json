His work led to the recognition that catabolic and anabolic processes do not proceed via the same reversible pathways but along separate routes. Leloir's significant contributions include the discovery of glucose-1,6-diphosphate (G1,6DP) and uridine diphosphate glucose (UDPG) as coenzymes, and the understanding that the synthesis of polysaccharides, like glycogen and starch, differs from their breakdown routes and involves different catalysts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
