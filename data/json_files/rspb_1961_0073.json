They describe the histology of the bacterial nervous system and discuss the possibility of synaptic connections between medium-sized nerve cells and giant axons. The study provides insights into the function and structure of bacterial flagella and their role in cellular organization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
