They found that during the induction period, the quantum efficiency of hydrogen chloride formation is very small, and the inhibition must be applied at the very inception of the hydrogen-chlorine chain. This work provides a deeper understanding of the reaction mechanism and the role of inhibitors in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
