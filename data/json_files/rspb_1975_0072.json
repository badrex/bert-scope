The results show that vasopressin reduces the affinity of amiloride, while aldosterone increases the number of amiloride binding sites. These findings suggest that vasopressin and aldosterone may alter the entry of sodium into epithelial cells, affecting sodium transport.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Physiology"}
