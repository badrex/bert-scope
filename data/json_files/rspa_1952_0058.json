They examine different mechanisms and conclude that the dissociative mechanism in a concentrated monolayer is too slow to account for the experimental results. The study suggests that a dilute monolayer is necessary for the dissociative mechanism to explain the observed reaction velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
