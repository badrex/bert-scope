The device consists of two tin-plate cylinders with glass disks, and it works by comparing the light from two sources and judging their equality by the movement of a colored liquid in a stem. Ritchie believes this photometer is ideal for measuring the light given off by gas lamps and hopes to create an instrument sensitive enough to detect the moon's rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
