The author applies boundary conditions to this solution and others already known, finding that the only solution in the magnetic case corresponds to a massless magnetic pole, while all electric case solutions correspond to continuous charge distributions. The fields tend asymptotically to that of a point charge in classical theory. The author also examines the solutions' singularities and charge densities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
