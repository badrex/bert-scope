They calculate the total and transverse average recoil-ion energies as functions of the laboratory proton scattering angle and consider the effect of target helium atoms' thermal motion. The CDW-EIS model provides better agreement between measurement and theory for total cross sections, improving our understanding of momentum exchange in ionizing processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
