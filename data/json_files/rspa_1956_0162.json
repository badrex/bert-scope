The authors evaluate the free volume, correlation integral, and communal parameter, and discuss the importance of multiple occupation and correlation effects. They compare their findings with experimental data and the theory of de Boer, concluding that the cell theory offers a promising approach to understanding liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
