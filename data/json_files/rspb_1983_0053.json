They injected mRNA from chick optic lobe and denervated cat muscle into the oocytes, which formed functional drug receptor channels. The study found that the channels activated by GABA and ACh had similar conductances of around 30 pS and different mean open times. These findings contribute to understanding drug receptors in the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
