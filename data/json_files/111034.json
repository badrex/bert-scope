He concluded that the instruments used were uniformly good, observations were faithfully recorded, and the readings were taken with great care. Glaisher reduced the data into useful tables, showing monthly, quarterly, and yearly mean temperatures, and the departure of each result from the mean of all. He also mentioned his intention to present results from the barometrical observations in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
