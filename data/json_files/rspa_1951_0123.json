The author presents a mathematical treatment of the process, considering an atmosphere with varying temperature at different heights. The results are expressed in terms of an 'equivalent gravitational oscillation,' and some numerical results are provided for the case of the solar semi-diurnal oscillation. The study contributes to understanding the complex interactions between the Earth's atmosphere and climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
