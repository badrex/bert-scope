The author discusses the effects of these metals on blood pressure, myocardial disease, and atherosclerosis. The study concludes that cobalt is unlikely to play a significant role in cardiovascular disease, while cadmium has notable effects on blood pressure in animals, and there is some evidence linking environmental lead exposure to high blood pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Health"}
