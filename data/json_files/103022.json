He discovered the unique structure of the pumice-stone, which contains small tubes or pipes, and the growth of sponges on coral. He also found that pumice-stones float on water due to their porous structure and that they contain salt. The author suggests that storms may be responsible for the formation of sponges and their incorporation of shells and stones."}
