The experiments show that strains have varying effects on the overall production of mixed cultures, and specific interactions between genotypes are significant. The average effect of a strain on the production of mixtures is uncorrelated with its performance in pure culture, suggesting that fitness measured in pure culture may not predict success in mixed populations. The results provide insights into the maintenance of genetic variation in natural communities and the potential benefits of genetic mixtures in agriculture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Population Biology"}
