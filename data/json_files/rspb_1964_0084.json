They found that the rate of sodium extrusion was independent of the resting potential level, suggesting that diffusion channels were not the main route for sodium extrusion. The sodium pump was temporarily blocked using azide ions, providing evidence for its contribution to the dynamic maintenance of intracellular ionic concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
