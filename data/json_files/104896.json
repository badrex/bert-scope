The author, John Huxham, investigated the event and observed unusual hailstones that fell in the area. These hailstones were nearly identical in size and shape, leading Huxham to suggest that a saline principle might be responsible for their uniformity. The incident and the hailstones' properties are noteworthy for understanding the effects of lightning and meteorological phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
