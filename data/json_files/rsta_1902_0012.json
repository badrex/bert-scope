The author explores the differences between a compressible gas and an incompressible liquid, and how these differences affect the stability of a rotating mass of gas. The study also considers the role of elasticity and thermal conductivity in the stability of a gaseous nebula.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
