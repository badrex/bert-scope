The first 20% of the reaction occurs through a radical chain, producing propylene and hydrogen peroxide. The second stage involves the secondary oxidation of propylene, altering the kinetics and oxidation products. Gas chromatography was used to analyze the reaction, confirming the validity of the proposed chain reaction mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
