He explains the equable tension of fluid surfaces and how it can be used to determine the elevation or depression of fluids. Young also discusses the adhesion of fluids to solids and the hydrostatic actions of fluid elevations and depressions. The study provides a better understanding of the attractions and repulsions of floating bodies and the cohesion between moistened surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
