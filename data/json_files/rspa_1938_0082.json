The research focuses on the biological cells within the cortex of these fibers, analyzing their composition and behavior. The findings suggest that the cells contain a mix of crystalline and amorphous keratin, and the intercellular material may also have important properties related to the fibers' elasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
