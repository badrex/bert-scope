Vervet monkeys are found to have a striking social knowledge, recognizing individuals, dominance relations, and kinship within their groups. However, they appear to know little about other aspects of their environment outside the social domain. The results support the view that primate intelligence has evolved mainly to solve social problems, making vervet monkeys excellent primatologists but poor naturalists.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
