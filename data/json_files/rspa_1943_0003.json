Newton discovered that white light is made up of different colors that can be separated by a prism. He also found that each color has a different refractive index, which led to the development of the field of spectroscopy. This discovery challenged the prevailing view of light as a single, indivisible entity and laid the foundation for modern optics and color theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
