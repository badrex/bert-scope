The researchers found that removing this area did not significantly impair the monkeys' ability to recognize faces or perform face-related tasks, suggesting that this area may be more involved in perceiving facial expressions and bearing rather than basic face recognition.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Cognitive Psychology"}
