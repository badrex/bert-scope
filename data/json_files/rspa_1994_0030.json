They analyze the asymptotic behavior of the solution as a small constant approaches zero. Under certain conditions, the solution takes values of 1 in a region and -1 in another region, with a thin interfacial region between them. The authors also study the one-dimensional case and show that the -limit set consists of a singleton.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Partial Differential Equations"}
