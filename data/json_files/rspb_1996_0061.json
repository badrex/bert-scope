The research investigates the blockage of sperm movement in the oviduct, which prevents cross-fertilization in certain clones. The findings suggest that a somatic-gametic incompatibility mechanism regulates mating in D. listerianum, possibly involving the differential phagocytic removal of sperm sharing self-recognition markers with maternal tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ascidian Biology"}
