They determined the ionization potential with an accuracy of 1 cm^-1 and found that the previously accepted value was in error by about 2500 cm^-1. This research led to the identification of new levels of Yttrium and improved understanding of its spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
