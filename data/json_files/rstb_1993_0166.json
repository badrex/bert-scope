They identify local optima (nutritional, intake, and growth targets) within a multidimensional nutritional space and investigate the rules animals use to reach these targets or find a point of best compromise. The framework considers the dynamical interactions among mechanisms regulating the intake of specific nutrient groups and the role of decision rules in resolving conflicts between nutrient intakes."}
