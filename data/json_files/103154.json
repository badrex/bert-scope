He suggests that these trees were likely buried by an extraordinary inundation of the River Thames, rather than by Noah's flood. The author also describes the soil and sediment in which the trees were found, and plans to conduct further experiments to better understand the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil and Sediment Analysis"}
