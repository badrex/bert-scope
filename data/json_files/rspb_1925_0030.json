The study shows that excitation is conducted up and down the leaf much faster than the water current, suggesting that the conduction is not related to the movement of a stimulating substance with the water. This research contributes to the understanding of plant communication and response mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
