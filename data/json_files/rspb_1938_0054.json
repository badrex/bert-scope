They discuss the relationship between erythema production and other local changes, as well as the general pharmacological actions of ultra-violet radiation. The study suggests that the erythemal response is due to photochemical decomposition of a constituent in the skin cells, leading to vasodilation and a diffusion time known as the latent period.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photobiology"}
