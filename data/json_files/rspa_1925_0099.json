The author discusses the stability of hemoglobin in various salt solutions and the factors affecting osmotic equilibrium. Experiments are conducted to test the permanence and reversibility of osmometer readings, and the results show that the method can accurately measure osmotic pressure in hemoglobin solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
