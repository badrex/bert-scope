They used a rapid thermal method to measure the velocity of reactions and determined the velocity constants for the reactions. The results showed that the rate of combination was influenced by the ionic strength of the solution. This research provides a foundation for understanding the interaction between carbon dioxide and amino acids in biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Amino Acid Chemistry"}
