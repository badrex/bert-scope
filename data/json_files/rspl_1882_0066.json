The machine aims to construct standard notes and accurately determine the pitch of tuning forks. The author also outlines a theory for the motion of electromagnetic tuning forks, which depends on the time of magnetization of the magnetic system. Experiments and calculations are presented to support the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
