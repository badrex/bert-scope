He observed the clock's performance in various weather conditions and found that it gained time during warm weather and lost time during cooler weather. Wollaston also noted that the clock's rate was affected by external factors such as frost and dampness. His observations suggest that longer experience and more advanced tools may help determine the exact causes of these variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
