The changes were observed to be related to the ability of ions to pass through the protoplasmic surface and the dielectric constant of the medium between the cells. The research provides insights into the electrical properties of biological systems and fish reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
