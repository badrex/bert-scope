They investigated the GR1 and ND1 centers, which are absorption bands formed after irradiation. The research focused on the temperature dependence of the GR1 doublet and the impact of nitrogen content on the diamond's properties. The findings provide insights into the electronic states and structure of the GR1 center and the interaction between nitrogen aggregates and radiation damage in diamonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
