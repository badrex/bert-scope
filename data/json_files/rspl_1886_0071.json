The author conducts experiments on rabbits, dogs, and cats, as well as human eyes, to understand the structure and function of these muscles. The study covers topics such as the nerves, vessels, and physiological actions of the intra-ocular muscles, providing valuable insights into the workings of the eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
