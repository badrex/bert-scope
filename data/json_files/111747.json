They discovered unique features in the alimentary canal and the circulatory system of these species, which challenged existing theories and understanding of Brachiopoda anatomy. The study provided new insights into the structure and function of these organisms, contributing to the field of comparative anatomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
