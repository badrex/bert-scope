Fibroblasts are social cells that interact with each other and their environment, which affects their growth and behavior. The author explains how these interactions can be influenced by long-range and short-range factors, such as growth factors and cell density. By studying fibroblasts and their response to tumour viruses, researchers can gain insights into cancer development and potential treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
