The authors review the current state of relaxational techniques and explore their applications in various fields, including electricity, magnetism, and thermal conductivity. They also present the finite-difference approximation and relaxation patterns for solving these equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
