The results show that acetylcholine has a faster time course of action than other drugs. The difference in time course between acetylcholine and carbaminoylcholine effects becomes insignificant when the muscle is treated with prostigmine, a cholinesterase inhibitor. The study suggests that the difference in time course observed in normal conditions is due to the faster removal of acetylcholine from its site of action by enzymatic hydrolysis in addition to diffusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
