The study focuses on rectangular plates with arbitrary chordwise rigidity variations and simple spanwise variations. The author derives a generalized engineering bending/torsion theory that can be applied in the initial design stages of load-bearing structures, such as aircraft wings, with favorable deformation under load.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
