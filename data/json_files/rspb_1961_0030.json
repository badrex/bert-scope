They find that the high rigidity of these muscles in tonic contraction is due to the tropomyosin-paramyosin system, suggesting that free ATP acts as a physiological plasticizer, affecting the electrostatic interactions between tropomyosin molecules within or between paramyosin filaments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
