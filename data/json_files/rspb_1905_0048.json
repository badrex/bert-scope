They found that the hydrolysis of amygdalin is not due to invertase, and the enzymatic action of yeast varies depending on the preparation. This research contributes to understanding the complex interactions between enzymes and glucosides.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Enzymology"}
