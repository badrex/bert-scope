They discovered that adding impurity significantly alters the penetration depth in both zero magnetic field and when a magnetic field is applied. This finding challenges the London theory of superconductivity. A new phenomenological theory is proposed, which adequately describes the observed effects of impurities on the penetration depth and provides an explanation for the absolute magnitude and anisotropy of the penetration depth in pure tin.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
