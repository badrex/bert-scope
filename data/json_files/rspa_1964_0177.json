They expand the stress function in a series of non-orthogonal eigenfunctions and use orthogonal functions to satisfy boundary conditions. The method is illustrated through four examples, demonstrating the application of St. Venant's principle to the strip.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
