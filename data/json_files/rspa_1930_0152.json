They used a Greinacher-type counter and ionization chambers to analyze the complexity of alpha-rays from radium, thorium, and actinium. This method allowed them to detect the presence of short-range alpha-particles in the dual disintegration of radium and revealed that actinium's alpha-rays are more complex than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
