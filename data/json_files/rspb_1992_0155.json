The authors demonstrate that vertical disparities can produce stereoptic depth effects and that the efficiency of utilizing these signals depends on the visual field quadrant and stimulus position. The findings contribute to our understanding of how the brain processes visual information and how depth perception is achieved.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
