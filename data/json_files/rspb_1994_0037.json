Capsaicin was found to block the open channels of these currents, with the block proceeding slowly and producing a characteristic 'inactivation' of the whole-cell current. The results suggest that capsaicin may be a useful tool for probing channel function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
