He observed that hoar-frost occurs in calm, clear conditions and found that still air in valleys is accompanied by downward air currents along the valley sides. These currents are due to the cooling of the earth's surface and the resulting condensation of air, preventing hoar-frost formation on inclined surfaces. This research provides insights into the atmospheric conditions that cause hoar-frost and the role of air currents in its formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
