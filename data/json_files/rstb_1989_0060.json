The author explains how recombinant DNA technology has allowed for the production of viral antigens, which have been used to create effective vaccines against hepatitis B. The article highlights the importance of surface antigens of viruses in stimulating immunological memory and the potential for other viral antigens to be used in controlling infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
