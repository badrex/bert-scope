Using a thermopile and a sensitive galvanometer, they measured the heat production and mechanical response of stimulated muscle fibers. The results showed that heat production started before any visible shortening, confirming that chemical changes precede mechanical responses in muscle contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
