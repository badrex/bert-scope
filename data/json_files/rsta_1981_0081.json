The study focuses on two types of instabilities: ideal magnetohydrodynamic perturbations and resistive instabilities. The authors find that the properties of growing perturbations can be predicted by theory to within the accuracy of experiment. They also observe self-control mechanisms in the plasmas, which are related to the relaxation of configurations to states of lower magnetic energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
