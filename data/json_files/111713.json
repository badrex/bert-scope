W. Hofmann investigates the transformations of bromide of bromethylated triethylphosphonium, including its reaction with pentabromide of phosphorus and oxide of silver. He also examines the formation of tetraethylphosphonium salts and the synthesis of monobrominated bromide of ethyl. This research contributes to the understanding of phosphorus-based compounds and their chemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
