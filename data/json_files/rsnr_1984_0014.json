The theorem states that if the sides of a polygon are restricted to pass through fixed points while all the vertices but one lie on fixed straight lines, the free vertex describes a conic section or a straight line. The disagreement between the two mathematicians arose not only over the priority of invention but also due to an insult implied by Braikenridge that MacLaurin did not know of the theorem, despite teaching it for eight years. The article examines the correspondence between the two mathematicians and concludes that there is no evidence to support Braikenridge's claim that he had the theorem before 1733.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
