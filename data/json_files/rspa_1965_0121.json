The study focuses on models of organic polymers, virus-antibody reactions, and the cluster theory of imperfect gases and liquids. The author presents a method to determine the complete statistical distribution of cluster sizes in equilibrium, considering various types of units and their interconnections.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
