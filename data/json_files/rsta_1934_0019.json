They used a research water tank and a stream function to study the motion of particles in the fluid, comparing the experimental results with the Navier-Stokes equations. This research provided insights into the behavior of fluids around elliptical shapes and helped validate theoretical models.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
