The authors describe their integrated stress measurement strategy, which involves hydraulic fracturing techniques and analysis of wellbore failures to determine stress magnitudes and orientations to mid-crustal depths. They emphasize the need to understand the validity of Byerlee's law and pore pressure assumptions in the upper crust to better understand the strength and deformation of the lithosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
