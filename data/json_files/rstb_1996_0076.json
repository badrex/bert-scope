The research reveals that natural selection for current ecological conditions is a primary force influencing morphological population differentiation, regardless of phylogenetic history. By studying numerous populations within small, heterogeneous islands, a better understanding of the factors causing geographic variation can be achieved.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
