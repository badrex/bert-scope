They consider the thermal conductivity of the material as temperature-dependent and provide results showing how the maximum temperature rise within heat sink packages depends on the input heat flux and the dimensions and thermal conductivity of the materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
