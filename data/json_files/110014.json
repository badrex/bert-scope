He discovered that the mineral contains a variable proportion of a peculiar bitumen, which can be separated by distillation at high temperatures. By subjecting the residue to a bright red heat, the mineral assumes the properties of pumice, due to the slow escape of the bituminous matter, creating a vesicular structure. The author details the process of analysis he employed for the separation of the constituent parts of this pitchstone and discusses its differences from other varieties of the mineral.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
