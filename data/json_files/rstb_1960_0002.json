They found that these fluctuations can account for the irregularities in homostyle distribution in natural populations and created artificial maps that closely resemble real maps of homostyle distribution. This research provides a better understanding of the evolutionary process and the role of random fluctuations in population genetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
