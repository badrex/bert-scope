Born in Cardiff, Waters attended Cambridge University, where he developed an interest in practical chemistry and organic preparations. He conducted Ph.D. research under the supervision of Hamilton McCombie and made significant contributions to the understanding of reaction mechanisms and structure-reactivity relations. Waters had a successful career in teaching and research, primarily at the University of Durham, where he made important connections and continued his research despite limited resources."}
