They observed interesting phenomena such as instabilities and periodic oscillations in the flow. The study provides insights into the fluid mechanics and heat transfer in heated cavity configurations, which are important in central solar energy receivers, compartment fires, and combustion in furnaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Mechanics"}
