Researchers discovered Plasmodium (Vinckeia) cephalophi and P. (V.) brucei in Malawi, and detailed the course of blood infection in a naturally infected splenectomized antelope. The study also found theileri-like trypanosomes in duikers, which are common in other ruminants. The research includes various aspects of duiker ecology, management, and health, such as feeding habits, behavior, and parasite infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
