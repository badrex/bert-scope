The study uses photographic evidence, temperature, and apprehension experiments to understand how fleas jump. The research reveals that the flea's hind legs are the primary source of jumping power, and the elastic energy released from a resilin pad in the pleural arch accelerates take-off. The findings also show that fleas take off from the trochanters, not the tarsi, and provide insights into the role of the middle leg in the jumping process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Entomology"}
