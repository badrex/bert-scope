The properties are well described in terms of bending, elastic buckling, and plastic collapse of the cell walls. The authors test silicone rubber models and metal honeycombs to validate their analysis, which is essential for understanding the mechanics of three-dimensional cellular solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
