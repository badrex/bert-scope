They describe their methods for comparing different types of cells and discuss the challenges of measuring light in various environments, such as under water and in different regions of the globe. The authors emphasize the need for precise measurements to differentiate light from total energy and the advantages of photo-electric methods for this type of work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
