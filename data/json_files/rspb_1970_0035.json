They found that almost all phytohaemagglutinin-induced mitoses of mouse blood lymphocytes had been processed by the thymus before becoming part of the circulating lymphocyte pool. This discovery may have implications for understanding the phytohaemagglutinin reaction in clinical medicine and the role of the thymus in immune responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
