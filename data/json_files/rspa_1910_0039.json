They determine the velocity of alpha particles using a magnetic field and a zinc sulphide screen. The authors find that the ionization curve for alpha particles is different from that of a pencil of rays, with a rapid increase in ionization followed by a sudden stoppage. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of alpha particles and their role in ionization and absorption processes."}
