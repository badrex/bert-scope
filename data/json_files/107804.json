The poison is a yellowish fluid that is slightly soluble in water and alcohol. It is not acidic or alkaline and has an acrid taste. Despite being more potent than snake venom, it does not cause harm when absorbed into the bloodstream. The toad's skin may serve as a defense mechanism against predators and also help separate carbon from the blood, aiding in respiration. The toad's anatomy includes thick, strong, and hard skin with a layer of cutis similar to bone, providing extra protection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
