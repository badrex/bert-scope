They found that species that rely on flight and those that migrate have more symmetrical wings. Additionally, long-tailed species with aerodynamically functional forked tails have more symmetrical outer tail feathers. These findings suggest that patterns of fluctuating asymmetry in long tails and wings may be better understood in the context of natural rather than sexual selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
