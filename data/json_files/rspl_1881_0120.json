They propose that stellar space is filled with rarefied gaseous matter, which could be attracted by planetary bodies and contribute to the solar system's energy balance. The author also considers the role of meteorites and spectrum analysis in understanding the composition of interplanetary space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
