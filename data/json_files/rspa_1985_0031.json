They found that the presence of stress affects the mechanical force and the fluxes of material species, and confirmed that the phenomenological coefficients remain the same. The three-dimensional kinetic theory provides expressions for the fluxes of the elementary species in terms of the gradients of concentration and stress, and reveals the role of crystal symmetry in determining the form of the flux equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
