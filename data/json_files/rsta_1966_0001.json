They found an empirical correlating equation to determine the enthalpy of steam, with an estimated accuracy of 0.1%. This research contributes to the development of accurate steam tables for power engineers and other users of high-pressure steam.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
