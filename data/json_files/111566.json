One type contains bone-corpuscles, while the other has a structureless, osteoid composition. The author also observes variations in bone structure within different fish tribes and discusses the implications of these findings for systematic zoology and the identification of fossil remains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
