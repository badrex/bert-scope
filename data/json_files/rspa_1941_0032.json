They found that the ignition is confined between a lower and an upper concentration of the catalyst, and the induction periods and limits depend on the pressure and temperature of the reactants. The study shows strong similarities between this system and the hydrogen-oxygen reaction sensitized by nitrogen peroxide, both in terms of ignition conditions and the effect of foreign gases. The results indicate that both systems are suitable for studying the mechanism of ignition in the temperature region of interest.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
