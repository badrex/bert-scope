The author presents nine experiments and explains the disturbances that arise from electrical waves not being suddenly lost after their first incidence on the abnormal part of the secondary. A method to avoid the greatest disturbance is suggested, and the results are compared with a mathematical theory of the phenomena involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
