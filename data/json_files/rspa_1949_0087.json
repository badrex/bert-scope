They calculate the heat of formation of CN using three different methods, including absorption spectra and extrapolation of vibrational levels. The study provides a more accurate estimation of the heat of formation of CN, which is essential for understanding the dissociation energies of CO and N2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermochemistry"}
