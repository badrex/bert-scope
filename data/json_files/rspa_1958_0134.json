They used a'shock-pass, heat-filter' method to investigate the phenomenon, presenting preliminary results using various primer and receptor charges. The study showed that the transition from deflagration to detonation can be influenced by factors such as plate thickness and the presence of liquid explosives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
