The study shows that these processes can produce currents similar to those observed in the Earth's oceans, with clockwise circulation in the Northern Hemisphere and a notable current along the western boundary, resembling the Gulf Stream.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
