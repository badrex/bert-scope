They found that more positive electricity was brought down by the rain, and large currents were less frequent than small ones. The authors also discovered that the charge per cubic centimeter of rain decreases as the rate of rainfall increases, with positive and negative charges behaving differently. These findings contribute to the understanding of the origin of thunderstorm electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
