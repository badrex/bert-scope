They argue that contraction happens on the cessation of stimulation, due to the operation of the attraction principle shared by all matter. The author discusses various objections to the theory and provides explanations for the phenomena of tremor, convulsion, and spasm, as well as the role of nervous influence and muscle polar action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
