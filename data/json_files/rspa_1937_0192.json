They found that the intensity of the bands is influenced by the concentration and structure of the molecules, and that the association band diminishes on dilution in a non-polar solvent or by raising the temperature. The study provides insights into the behavior of hydroxy compounds and their applications in various solvents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
