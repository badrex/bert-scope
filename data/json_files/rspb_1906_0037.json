These strands, also known as pseudopodia, were present in various stages of development and appeared to play a role in coordinating the activities of the embryo. The author found that these strands were similar to the filose filaments described by Andrews in other organisms and believed they were essential for cell communication and coordination during early development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
