He discusses the strains caused by weight distribution, water pressure, and ocean waves, and evaluates the strength and utility of different construction methods, including those proposed by Mr. Seppings. Young concludes that while some experimental methods are promising, further research and cautious implementation are necessary.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval architecture"}
