It focuses on the identification of stable regions in equilibrium paths with a succession of folds, where the degree of instability changes by one at each fold. The author demonstrates the application of this theory to the stability of elastic structures under dead and rigid loading, as well as in the buckling of arches, domes, and gravitational collapse of massive cold stars."}
