By analyzing the angles of the temples and the changes in the positions of stars due to the precession of the equinoxes, the author attempts to find the dates of the temples' foundations. This study provides insight into the ancient Greeks' understanding of astronomy and their use of stars for timekeeping.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeoastronomy"}
