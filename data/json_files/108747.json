They discover that the vast ocean to the south of India and the influence of the Himalayas affect the plumb-line, causing discrepancies in the astronomical and geodetic amplitudes. The study helps in understanding the accuracy of relative positions of places in a map and the influence of local attraction on geodetic operations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
