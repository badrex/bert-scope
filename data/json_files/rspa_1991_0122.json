Their findings support a ground state with a large magnetic moment and an Ising-like spin hamiltonian, indicating a purely magnetic dipole-dipole interaction between nearest-neighbour ions. These results provide insights into the unusual properties of this series of salts and contribute to the understanding of their crystal field and spin hamiltonian behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
