The author explains how equivalent orbitals can be used to interpret the repulsion between electrons in molecules and the role of lone pairs of electrons in determining molecular shape. The article also explores the transformation of molecular orbitals to equivalent orbitals and its implications for understanding molecular properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
