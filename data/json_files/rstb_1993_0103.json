The model suggests that low colonization density and increased aggregation favor female-biased broods, and that the probability of a female being isolated and able to mate with her son increases the value of female colonizers. This can lead to skewed sex ratios in haplodiploid species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
