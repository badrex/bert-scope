They found that the presence of organic matter in the culture medium is essential for the growth of these organisms. The study also showed that Euglena viridis is more holophytic than Euglena gracilis, meaning it relies more on photosynthesis for its nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protistology"}
