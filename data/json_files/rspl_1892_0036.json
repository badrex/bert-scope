They found that the Nova's spectrum had no relationship with the bright-line nebulae, comets, or carbon oxide. The observed spectrum suggested a state of things similar to the erupted matter at the solar surface. The authors also noted the presence of multiple bright lines in the spectrum, which they estimated with approximate accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
