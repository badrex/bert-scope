They used both Hartree and Fock approximations to calculate the energy and analyzed the changes in screening constants in passing from atomic to molecular states. The study provides a guide to the accuracy of molecular orbital methods for more complex molecules and emphasizes the importance of orthogonality in discussing electron exchange.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
