They discovered three types of wandering cells and observed their response to various stimuli, such as the injection of anthrax bacilli. The study also revealed the process of leukocytosis and the role of eosinophile and hyaline cells in combating microorganisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
