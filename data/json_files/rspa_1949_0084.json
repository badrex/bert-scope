By using group theory, the author transforms the equations satisfied by molecular orbitals, providing a connection between molecular orbital theory and localized bonds. This work applies to molecules in their ground states and helps understand the behavior of electrons in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
