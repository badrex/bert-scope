The ratio of population decline to habitat loss depends on the relative importance of density dependence in wintering and breeding areas. The greater the density dependence in a season, the more significant the consequences of habitat loss in that season. Game theory models can be used to determine the density-dependent relations and predict the impact of habitat loss on migratory populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Conservation Biology"}
