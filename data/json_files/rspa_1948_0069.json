The author develops a model of a polyatomic molecule as a classical vibrating system that dissociates when a specific internal coordinate, such as bond extension, reaches a critically high value. The author derives the high-pressure rate at absolute temperature and explores various methods to calculate the rate, examining their relation to each other and to the general formalism of the transition state. The article also discusses the significance of the transition velocity and the partition function of the complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
