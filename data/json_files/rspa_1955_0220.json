They discovered that the salt's conductance depends on oxygen partial pressure and can be altered by treatment with hydrogen chloride. The treatment affects the stoichiometry of the salt and modifies the effect of the thermal transition. The results provide insights into the nature of the transition and the role of lattice defects in caesium chloride.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid State Chemistry"}
