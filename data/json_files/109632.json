It compares the camel's stomach structure to other ruminants and explains how the camel's second stomach acts as a water reservoir. The author also examines the camel's teeth and the differences between ruminant and non-ruminant animals. Additionally, the article mentions experiments on camel urine by Mr. Brand, though the analysis is considered an approximation due to the small sample size.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
