They discuss the consequences of exchange interactions on the spin states during inelastic collisions and present a scattering theory approach to calculate scattering cross-sections for spin-independent and spin-correlated cases. The study is relevant to understanding processes in the upper atmosphere and interstellar space.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Collisions"}
