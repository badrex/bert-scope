It has a unique structure consisting of 24 protein subunits that form a hollow shell. The central cavity of ferritin contains an iron core called ferrihydrite, which can store up to 4500 iron atoms. Ferritin plays a crucial role in maintaining iron homeostasis and is involved in the delivery of iron for hem synthesis. The formation of ferritin from apoferritin is self-catalyzing, and its structure provides insights into how iron is deposited and stored within the protein shell.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
