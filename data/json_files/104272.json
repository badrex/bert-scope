Vievar and Sam Shepheard. The events caused loud noises, violent movements of water, and physical damage. The phenomena appeared to involve interactions between air and water, with one account describing the water becoming \"extremely agitated, as rough as the Thames in a storm, foaming and smoking.\" The events had no apparent connection to lightning or thunder and occurred on a calm, sunny day.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Unusual Weather Events"}
