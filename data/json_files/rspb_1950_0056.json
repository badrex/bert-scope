It explores various growth formulae, their derivation, and the importance of statistical methods in estimating parameters. The author also highlights the limitations of the allometric formula and suggests alternative methods for studying differential growth, such as embedded coordinates and multivariate regression analysis. The article emphasizes the need for long-term programs to study growth and shape changes in individuals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Growth and Development"}
