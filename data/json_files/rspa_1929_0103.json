They found that the maximum current occurs at a depth below the surface and that the frictional force increases from the surface to the bottom. The results provide insights into the complex motion of water in the sea and the role of internal friction in tidal currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
