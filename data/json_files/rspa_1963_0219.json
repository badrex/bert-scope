They measured the rate of increase in the strength of absorption bands of SO and found that the process follows a unimolecular first step. The activation energy was determined to be around 66 kcal/mol, and the authors suggested a possible decomposition mechanism involving a triplet state of the sulfur dioxide molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
