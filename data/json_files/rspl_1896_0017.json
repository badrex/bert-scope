The results show that different types of steel exhibit different behaviors, with some experiencing a decrease in magnetic moment upon initial cooling, while others show an increase. The study provides insights into the properties of materials at low temperatures and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
