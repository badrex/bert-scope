The solution confirms the presence of radiation through the Riemann tensor's asymptotic behavior. The wave permanently distorts the space-time, indicating that it carries energy, but the specific source of this energy remains unknown until background terms can be built into the metric.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
