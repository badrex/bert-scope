It explores the impact of sexual selection and natural selection on the mean and standard deviation of offspring populations. The author also introduces the coefficients of correlation for paternal and maternal inheritance, which help measure the influence of each parent on the offspring's traits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
