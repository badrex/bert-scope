The authors discuss various sources of error and their possible impact on the results. They find that the contractions show a transition stage within a 1-2% range, and the values for refractive indices are not constant but decrease with increased concentration. The results are compared to existing formulas and illustrated with curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid solutions"}
