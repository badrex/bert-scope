The author examines various studies and theories about the Megatherium's habits, comparing its bones to those of existing species to determine its relationships and affinities. The article also discusses the discovery of additional bones and the bony armor found with the Megatherium, which supports the theory that it was related to armadillos.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
