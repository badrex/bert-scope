The research shows that the Earth's surface temperature has risen over the past 100 years and probably for the past 1000 years, with the rate of warming being latitude-dependent. The findings also suggest that the anthropogenic effect, such as the addition of greenhouse gases from coal and petroleum burning, is twice as high in the Northern Hemisphere as in the Southern Hemisphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
