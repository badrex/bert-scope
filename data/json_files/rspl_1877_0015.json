They discovered that the discharge form changes from stratified to unstratified as the charge increases. The experiments also showed that the tension, rather than the quantity, determines the character of the discharge. The findings contribute to the understanding of gas discharge phenomena and electromagnetic theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
