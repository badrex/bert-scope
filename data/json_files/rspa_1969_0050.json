They found that almost all N2O molecules were vibrationally excited, with energy from the reaction entering all three vibration modes. This research provides insights into the partitioning of energy in chemical reactions and the formation of vibrationally excited molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reaction kinetics"}
