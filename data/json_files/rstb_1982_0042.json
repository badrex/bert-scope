It presents a hypothesis explaining the relation between exposure to petroleum and the ecological changes in the area. The study shows that exposure to a large volume of petroleum initially destroys all organisms, followed by a stimulatory period and a gradual return to normal. The Coal Oil Point area's patchy distribution of petroleum, habitats, and species distribution contribute to the overall enrichment observed in some communities.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
