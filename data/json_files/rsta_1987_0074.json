The authors describe their experiments with heavy-ion accelerators, focusing on half-life measurements, radioisotope detection in solar neutrino experiments, and the determination of 41Ca concentrations in natural samples. They also discuss a method of isobar separation using a gas-filled magnetic field region, which improves sensitivity in detecting low concentrations of heavy elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
