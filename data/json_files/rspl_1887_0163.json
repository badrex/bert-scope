They observed the appearance and disappearance of bright lines in the spectrum of the chromosphere and inner corona, confirming previous findings by Mr. Lockyer. The observations were conducted using a 6-inch refractor by Simms with a grating spectroscope, and the structure of the corona was found to be radial to the limb throughout. The author also compares the results obtained with the Rutherfurd grating and Rowland's grating, finding them closely concordant.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
