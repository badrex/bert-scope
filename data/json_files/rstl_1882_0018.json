They establish quadratic relations between these functions and express them in terms of new variables. The study of theta-functions' quadruple periodicity and their periods is investigated, leading to the development of equations and transformations that reveal connections between various mathematical concepts.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
