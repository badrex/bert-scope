They found that the enzyme has a nearly absolute requirement for acetyl-coenzyme A and is inhibited by L-aspartate. These properties are similar to those observed in other pyruvate carboxylases from mesophilic organisms. The study provides insights into the regulation of carbon dioxide fixation in thermophilic bacteria, which is important for understanding their growth and metabolism in high-temperature environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
