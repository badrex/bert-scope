The thermometer's design includes a protected bulb and a unique mechanism for registering temperature by overturning the instrument. This innovation addresses the limitations of previous thermometers used in deep-sea investigations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
