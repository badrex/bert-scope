They discovered that one enzyme, \u03b2-lactamase I, is inactivated by 6-\u03b2-bromopenicillanic acid, with serine-44 being the site of reaction. This serine residue is conserved in other \u03b2-lactamases and is considered a good candidate for an active site group in these enzymes. The other enzyme, \u03b2-lactamase II, requires metal ions for activity, with three histidine residues and the enzyme's sole thiol group binding the metal ion needed for activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
