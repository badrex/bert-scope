They found that seed limitation and soil disturbance play a significant role in the recruitment and persistence of oilseed rape populations. The study also showed that proximity to junctions and traffic direction influenced the density of oilseed rape plants. The findings can help in managing the spread of oilseed rape along motorways and other similar environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
