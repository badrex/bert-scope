Hofmann, explores the isomerism between alpha-nitraniline and beta-nitraniline, two compounds with different physical and chemical properties. He also discovers the isomerism between alpha-phenylene-diamine and beta-phenylene-diamine, which have distinct crystallizing powers. The author examines their reactions with various reagents and discusses their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
