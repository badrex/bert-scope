They developed methods to find the distribution of trap levels at different depths below the conduction band and explored the thermal stability of trapped electrons. Their findings provide a quantitative explanation of phosphorescence in terms of trap distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
