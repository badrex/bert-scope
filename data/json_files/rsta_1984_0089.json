Models of Uranus's interior show that the ratio of ice-forming materials to rock must be greater than three for a rotation period of about 16 hours. This finding challenges some accretional theories that require high temperatures for nebular gas before being incorporated into a planet.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar System Formation"}
