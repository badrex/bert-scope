It reveals that reflex interaction is evident in every instance and between every nerve-pair tried, with the form of interaction varying for different nerve pairs. The research also discovers a restricted ipsilateral flexor inhibition, which is a departure from the broad rule that ipsilateral hind-limb reflexes are excitatory and not inhibitory to the flexor muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
