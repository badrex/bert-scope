Using the Mendelian theory of inheritance, the author calculates the offspring of brother-sister and first cousin marriages, finding that inbreeding increases the relative chances of recessive traits appearing in offspring. The study also compares the percentage of allogenic offspring from first cousin marriages to that of unrelated pairs, highlighting the potential risks and consequences of inbreeding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
