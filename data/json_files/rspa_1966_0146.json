The researchers used the mutual indentation method to overcome the problem of indenter softening. They found that most refractory solids are hard but brittle at low temperatures, while above a critical temperature, they become ductile, and hardness decreases with increasing temperature. The results show that only silicon nitride and carbide of silicon have indentation hardness above 100 at any temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Hardness Testing"}
