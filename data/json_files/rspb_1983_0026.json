They identified two functional types of 'free' nerve-endings, type I and type II, based on their branching patterns, varicosities, and innervation. Type I neurites are'movement' detectors, while type II neurites are 'rapid transient' detectors. These findings provide insights into the structure and function of sensory nerve fibers and their roles in touch and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
