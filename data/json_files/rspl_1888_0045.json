They discovered a process that created a dense, hard form of carbon with increased density and hardness. This material could be used in arc lamps and incandescent lamp burners. The authors also investigated the role of lime and silica in the formation of this hard carbon material.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Hard Carbon Materials"}
