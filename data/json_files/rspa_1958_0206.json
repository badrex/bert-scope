They propose that liquid water consists of co-operatively bonded clusters of ice-like material surrounded by non-bonded fluid. This concept explains various properties of water, such as its dielectric constant and the behavior of aqueous solutions. The author also suggests that the degree of covalency in the hydrogen bond may affect the structure and properties of ice."}
