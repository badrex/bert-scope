They used the heavy-atom technique, focusing on the cobalt atom, to generate electron density maps and deduce the positions of various atoms in the molecule. This research provided insights into the structure of vitamin B12 and laid the foundation for future studies of complex organic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
