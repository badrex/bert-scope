The author presents mathematical models of knife-edge and flexure-strip balances to analyze their sensitivity and susceptibility to tilt and horizontal ground vibrations. The study concludes that the precision of weighing is currently limited by ground vibration noise, but knife-edge balances can potentially achieve a resolution of tens of nanograms."}
