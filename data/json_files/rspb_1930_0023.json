They discover that the structure of these films varies depending on the concentration of nitrocellulose and that the rate of flow of water through these membranes is not inversely proportional to their thickness. This research contributes to a better understanding of filtration and filterable viruses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
