The authors investigate the elastic scattering of two atoms in their ground state and find that the effective cross-section is a mean of the cross-sections for scattering in the singlet and triplet states. The phase shifts and associated cross-sections are presented, and the coefficient of viscosity is estimated using the empirical method of Hirschfelder and Eliason.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Molecular physics"}
