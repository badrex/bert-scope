They found that the inclusion of perfluoromethylcyclohexane, perfluorodimethylcyclohexane, and perfluorocyclobutene in synthetic faujasite crystals was reversible, except for perfluorocyclobutene, which underwent a chemical reaction within the zeolite. The equilibrium isotherms were analyzed, and the results showed that the behavior of these fluorocompounds was general for zeolitic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
