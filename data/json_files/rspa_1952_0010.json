They find that the solutions have an infinity of singular surfaces and do not contain an arbitrary constant corresponding to the mass of the system. The electric field arises from a dispersed charge distribution containing both positive and negative electricity, while the magnetic field can be considered as arising from a point magnetic pole. The solutions are unlikely to have physical significance, as more likely solutions exist in the purely electric case.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
