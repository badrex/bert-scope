They discovered that certain conditions, such as temperature and the presence of bacteria, can affect the amount of cystin precipitated. The authors suggest that a fermentation caused by a large organism, possibly a torula, might be responsible for this process. This research could help improve our understanding of cystin's state of combination in the urine and its role in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
