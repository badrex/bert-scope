They also studied the effect of light on radiometers, discovering that heating or cooling the radiometers caused them to rotate in opposite directions. The author found that the behavior of the cup-shaped radiometers was complex and required further investigation. The study also showed an increase in the secular acceleration of the Horizontal Force, and a semiannual inequality in the magnetic force, with the force being greater when the sun is closer to the earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
