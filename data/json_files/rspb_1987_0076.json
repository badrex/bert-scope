The researchers found that area 19 (W-type input) processes more divergent disparities, area 17 (X-, Y-, and W-type input) convergent disparities, and area 18 (Y-type input) disparities around zero. This supports the hypothesis that these three streams of information process different classes of binocular disparities, contributing to the processing of form and motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Perception"}
