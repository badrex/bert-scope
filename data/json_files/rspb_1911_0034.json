They discovered that only 8% of infected flies develop the parasite further, while 92% of flies experience the trypanosomes' degeneration and death within the first few days. The authors also found that the trypanosomes in the salivary glands revert to the normal blood-type, which is crucial for the fly's infectivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
