They analyzed the morphology of these strains and found significant differences in their size and shape. The researchers also observed that each human strain of the trypanosome had unique characteristics, making it difficult to classify them using a single measurement method. The study aimed to gain a better understanding of these parasites to improve disease classification and treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
