They demonstrate how Dirichlet's and Thomson's principles arise in a complementary manner, leading to upper and lower bounds for the field energy. A generalized (variable dielectric) form of Thomson's principle is also derived.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
