The authors used the molecular Fourier transform to calculate a Fourier projection of a single row of molecules, which provides a clearer picture of the molecular outline. The results show the advantages of using the molecular Fourier transform as a continuous function of one of the axes, allowing for a better understanding of the haemoglobin molecule's structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
