The authors find that chemical scavenging occurs more rapidly at ocean margins, leading to significant net fluxes of certain chemicals from the ocean interior into margin sediments. This process has important implications for understanding how the ocean assimilates added materials and influences chemical concentrations in the water column.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
