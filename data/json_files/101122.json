Francesco Lana, observed two phenomena: the melting of metals by the burning concave of lions and the extraction of a unique salt from a metallic substance. He questioned why kitchen fires melt gold more quickly than iron and discussed the possibility of astral heat being drier than common fire. Additionally, he discovered that the extracted salt turned into a golden-colored liquid upon heating and reverted to salt upon cooling, forming fine threads resembling cobwebs.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
