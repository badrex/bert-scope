The study found that older males' songs have more broken and worn stridulatory pegs, which are used to create the songs. This suggests that females may choose younger males because they produce higher quality songs and possibly better genetic traits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
