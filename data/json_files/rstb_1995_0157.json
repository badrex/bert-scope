They use anti-laminin antibody to visualize the mesonephric duct and tubules in the genital ridge and find that cellular connections between mesonephric tubules and the gonadal primordium exist in both male and female gonads. These connections may be the pathways for the founder cells of the gonadal primordium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
