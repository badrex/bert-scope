They found that the slopes of the crystals' behavior are determined by the hydrocarbon chain, while the polar group influences the slope of the equilibrium pressure. This research provides insights into the properties of long-chain compounds and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
