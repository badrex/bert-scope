The trabecular tissue is identified as a syncytium, and the sponge lacks choanocytes. Unique features include perforate septa, or \"plugs,\" which act as filters or partial barriers between specialized portions of the cytoplasm. The sponge's system for impulse conduction is likely the trabecular syncytium, and collar body flagella regulate water flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Sponge Biology"}
