He explains how these foramina help prevent disease by allowing blood to flow into the heart's cavities and relieve pressure in nutrient vessels. Abernethy also discusses the foramen ovale, a natural opening between the heart's left and right atria, and how it can renew in cases of pulmonary disease to maintain proper blood circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
