They discovered that the magnitude of electrical changes in nerve cells can be used as an index to measure the magnitude of chemico-physical changes under various chemical conditions. The author also investigated the effects of various substances, such as anaesthetics, acids, alkalies, neutral salts, and narcotics on the electrical activity of nerve cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
