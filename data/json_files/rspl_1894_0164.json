They found that the composition of these atmospheres closely matches the composition of air expired from the lungs. The results suggest that extinguishing a flame does not necessarily indicate that an atmosphere is unsuitable for breathing.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flammability"}
