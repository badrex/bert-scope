The runner held their breath while running and placed the mouthpiece in their mouth after finishing the run to collect expired air. The results showed that the oxygen requirement increased with speed, and the maximum oxygen debt incurred by the subject was higher than previous observations. The study provides valuable data on the energy utilization during running and contributes to the understanding of running performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Exercise Physiology"}
