The technique involves drilling a hole in the rock, inserting a double wedge, and then detonating a small amount of gunpowder. This process cracks and breaks the rock, making it easier to remove. The method was invented by Monsieur Du Son and has potential applications in mines of lead, tin, and other materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mining Techniques"}
