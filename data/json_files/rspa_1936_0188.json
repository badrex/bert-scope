They found that the configuration of certain carbon atoms and groups in the steroid molecules has a significant impact on their optical properties. The study also explored the concept of induced dissymmetry, where unsaturated linkages close to an asymmetric carbon atom can cause a change in optical activity. This research provides a better understanding of the relationship between the molecular structure and optical properties of steroids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
