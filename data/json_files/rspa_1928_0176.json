The authors use a photographic method combined with a microphotometer to measure the distribution of optical density along the photographic plates. They find that the straggling and loss of velocity increase with the thickness of the foil and the mass per unit area of the straggling material. The results confirm and supplement previous work on the most probable loss of velocity in beta-particles."}
