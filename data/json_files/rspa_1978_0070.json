It also explores the use of swift rotation in physics, particularly in the development of velocity-spectrometers and velocity-selectors for molecules. The author shares personal recollections and anecdotes from his time working with Rutherford's colleagues.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
