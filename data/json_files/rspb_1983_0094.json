The fossilized leaves and leafy shoots provide insights into the evolution and possible ancestral groups of conifers, contributing to the ongoing debate on their origin. The study examines the structure and stomatal arrangement of the leaves, as well as the similarities to other Carboniferous and modern conifers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
