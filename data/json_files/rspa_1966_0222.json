They observed triplet yields in samples with increased fluorescence and found that the half-life of chlorophyll triplets was 2.02 ms, independent of concentration. The study provides insights into the behavior of chlorophyll in high concentration and more closely resembles conditions in vivo, potentially leading to a better understanding of the chlorophyll organization in the photosynthetic unit.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photosynthesis"}
