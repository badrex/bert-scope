They found that the bands require a modification in the assigned vibrational quantum number v' in the upper state. The afterglow bands are present in the night sky, but some previously attributed bands do not belong to the system. The intensity distribution of the system is discussed, and it is suggested that the bands are excited by the recombination of oxygen atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
