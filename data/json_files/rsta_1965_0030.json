They argue that the serpentinized peridotite layer in the oceanic crust is dispersed by mantle convection currents and that the composition of volcanic gases supports the idea of water being derived from the degassing of rising mantle convection cells beneath mid-ocean ridges. This research contributes to the understanding of the Earth's geological processes and the formation of oceanic crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
