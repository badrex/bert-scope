He discusses the development of a camphine lamp with adjustable slit for optimal light intensity and the use of bromide of silver paper with added iodide of silver for sensitive and durable impressions. The paper is placed around a cylindrical French shade, which is then used to trace magnetic curves. This method allows for precise and accurate registration of magnetometer and meteorological instrument variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
