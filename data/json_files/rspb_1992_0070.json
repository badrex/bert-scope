They found that the sets of chromosomes in the hybrids behaved independently, with some configurations more likely to occur in certain chromosome sets. This study has implications for the potential value of these hybrids in plant breeding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Breeding"}
