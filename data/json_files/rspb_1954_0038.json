They found that the membrane resistance and capacity were affected by the external solution's concentration and the presence of plant-growth substances. The results provide insights into the cell membrane's complex structure and behavior, contributing to our understanding of plant physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
