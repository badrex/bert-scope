They demonstrate that the velocity of propagation does not depend on the specific resistance of the wire and increases with the rapidity of the electrical oscillations. This study helps to explain the differences in propagation rates observed by previous researchers and provides a means to test the validity of Maxwell's theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
