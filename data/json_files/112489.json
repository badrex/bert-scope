They found that the presence of plants and the absorption of sunlight help to reduce the hardness of the water by breaking down carbonic acid produced by fish. The study also showed that during winter months, when plant activity is lower, the water becomes more acidic and harder due to increased carbonic acid production by fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Aquatic Ecology"}
