They found that the degeneration occurs between the 4th and 6th day of natal life and is confined to the cochlea and saccule. The study suggests that the inner ear degeneration is a derangement of the water electrolyte regulating mechanism, and the gene may play a role by reducing enzyme content during critical maturation. Similar mechanisms may be involved in human congenital deafness, both genetically determined and in cases with no apparent genetic factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Development"}
