The author explains the theory behind the absorption of acoustic waves and how they interact with the nuclear spins in the crystal. The study focuses on the ground state of the europium ion and the two stable isotopes of mass 151 and 153, which have nuclear spin 5/2. The author deduces the formulae for nuclear acoustic resonance and discusses the potential applications of this method in studying europium vanadate and other similar crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
