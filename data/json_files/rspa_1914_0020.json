They developed an instrument that eliminates the effect of Earth's magnetic field and can measure resistance accurately. The method involves using two discs, four magnetizing coils, and a Wheatstone bridge. The results show a satisfactory agreement with the International ohm standard, proving the effectiveness of the new method.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrical and Magnetic Fields"}
