They find that sagapenum resin is soluble in alcohol and water, while galbanum resin dissolves only slightly in alcohol. Both resins have a strong odor and give off volatile matter when heated. The author suggests that resins may be made up of multiple compound radicals and proposes further research on this topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
