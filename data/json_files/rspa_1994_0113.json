This method is more accurate and efficient than the conventional one for determining properties like the diffusion coefficient, velocity autocorrelation function, and density profile in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous systems. The simulation uses the Lennard-Jones potential for particle interactions, and the results cover a wide range of fluid states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Computational Physics"}
