These events can evoke action potentials that propagate along the axon of the neuron and play a role in shaping motor output in insects. Plateau potentials are calcium-dependent and can be triggered by depolarizing current injection. This finding challenges the previous belief that plateau potentials do not contribute to motor pattern generation in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
