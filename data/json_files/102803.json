He observed that the worms were being consumed by smaller worms, which later transformed into flies. The author also found that these creatures were responsible for the growth of \"knots\" or tumors on willow leaves, which he believed were caused by the worms' excrement. This research provided valuable insights into the complex relationships between different organisms and their interactions with plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
