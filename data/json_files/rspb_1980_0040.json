It confirms that a normal level of androgen receptor protein is not essential for reproduction in female mice. However, Tfm/Tfm females show impaired reproductive performance and premature cessation of reproduction due to accelerated ageing processes in the ovaries. This work supports the role of androgen in controlling follicular maturation and atresia, mediated by the androgen receptor coded by the Tfm locus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Reproductive Biology"}
