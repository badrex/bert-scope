They find that the inverse square law is not accurately obeyed for small distances, and the problem becomes more complex. The authors provide necessary and sufficient conditions for a real orbit and discuss the limitations of their analysis. The results are suggestive of Bohr's quantized orbits and can be applied to the hydrogen atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
