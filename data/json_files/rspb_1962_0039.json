The direct reaction occurs when antigenic matter from the donor is injected into the recipient, while the transfer reaction happens when living cells from the recipient's regional lymph nodes are injected into the donor. Both reactions are immunologically specific and depend on the local engagement of antigens with sensitized cells. The study also explores the time of onset and rate of decay of sensitivity, the transfer of reactivity by different lymphoid cells, the effects of dead or disintegrated lymphoid cells, the impact of hydrocortisone on the reactions, and the consequences of hyperimmunization.", "scientific_discipline": "Immunology > Tissue Transplantation"}
