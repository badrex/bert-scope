The research found that there are both direct and relayed inputs from periodontal receptors via mossy fibers in a specific region of the cerebellar cortex. These findings provide insights into the complex interactions between sensory inflow and motor commands in the cerebellum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
