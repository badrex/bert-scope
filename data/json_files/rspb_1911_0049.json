These granules are thrown off with force and exhibit motility in the blood. The study was conducted on the Jerboa, an animal in which the disease runs a chronic course. The extrusion of granules is believed to be related to the periodic disappearance of trypanosomes from the circulating blood. Further research is needed to understand the significance of this observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
