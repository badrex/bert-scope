The authors discuss the impact of internal motion, distortion, and external forces on the transfer of momentum and mass across the liquid-liquid interface. They compare the Hadamard and Hill vortex models and analyze the effects of interfacial tension, viscosity, and Reynolds numbers on vortex formation and circulation velocities. The study has implications for understanding mass transfer processes in chemical engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
