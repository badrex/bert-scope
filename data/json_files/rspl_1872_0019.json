They found warm water and an open sea at certain seasons of the year as far north as 81\u00b0. The author suggests that this warm water may flow from the circumpolar region, indicating a circumpolar sea. Further investigation of these warm currents and their impact on oceanic theories and weather patterns in the northern hemisphere is needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
