They explain how the theory of antisymmetric electron wave functions helps describe the spectra of atoms and the chemical combination between atoms. The authors also apply Oppenheimer's methods to calculate the angular distribution of elastic and inelastic scattering, as well as the probabilities of excitation of triplet states in helium and hydrogen."}
