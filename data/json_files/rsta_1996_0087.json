The Surface Evolver program is used to explore the influence of surface constraints. The authors also investigate the structure of wet and dry foams and the transitions between them, as well as the potential for ordered structures in foam science.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
