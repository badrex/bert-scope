The authors recorded 55 species of birds, including 14 species recorded for the first time in the decade. The study provides a baseline for future work on bird recolonization and discusses the implications for island biogeography theory. The authors also describe their survey methods, which were non-destructive to protect the fragile populations on the islands.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
