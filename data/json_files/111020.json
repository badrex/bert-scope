He observed the development of the carapace and plastron in the embryos and young of different Chelonian genera, and his findings challenge previous theories on the nature and homologies of these structures. The study is supported by comparisons with bird and crocodile skeletal structures and is illustrated with figures of the carapace, plastron, and corresponding segments of the skeleton.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Anatomy"}
