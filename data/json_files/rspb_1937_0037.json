The researchers found that certain carcinogenic hydrocarbons inhibited body growth, suggesting that this inhibition might not be specific to tumors. The findings could have implications for cancer research and understanding the effects of chemicals on living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
