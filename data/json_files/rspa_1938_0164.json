They discuss the concept of projected length and its application to geodesics, null geodesics, and optical co-ordinates. The metric in optical co-ordinates is also analyzed, and its simplified form is derived. This new approach is particularly useful for astronomical optics and the study of light rays and wave fronts in a manifold.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
