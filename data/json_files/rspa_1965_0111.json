They found that complex laminar flows can be described by complex dependent variables and that certain properties of real integrals of the complex Navier-Stokes equations can be used to analyze flow patterns around leading and trailing edges of dihedral angles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
