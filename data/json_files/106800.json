The rainbows appeared due to the sun shining while a thunderstorm cloud produced the rain. The primary rainbows were not concentric but touched each other, with a secondary bow to each. The phenomenon was studied and explained in terms of light reflection and the position of the sun and the cloud.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
