The author analyzes previous experiments by Tyndall and McConnel, discussing the factors that influence ice viscosity, such as temperature and shear stress. The author also conducts additional experiments with pitch to understand the behavior of viscous substances under stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
