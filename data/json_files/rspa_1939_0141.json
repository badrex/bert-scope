They discovered that the omission of atoms in these alloys occurs when a certain ratio of valency electrons to atoms is exceeded. This phenomenon is explained by the accommodation of electrons in the Brillouin zone, which maintains a constant number of electrons per unit cell. The results provide insight into the behavior of these alloys and contribute to the understanding of material science.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
