The author conducted various experiments, including section or destruction of the lateral region of the medulla, and observed the degeneration of different tracts in the spinal cord and cerebellum. The findings provide insights into the complex neural connections and pathways within the medulla oblongata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
