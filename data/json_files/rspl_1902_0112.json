They discovered that nucleoproteids are dextrorotatory bodies, meaning they rotate plane-polarized light in a clockwise direction. This research helped expand the understanding of the complex albuminous substances found in the nucleated protoplasm of animal organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
