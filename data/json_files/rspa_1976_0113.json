They applied a relativistic analogue of intermediate coupling with configuration interaction to this spectrum for the first time. The results fit favorably with experimental results and provide a better understanding of the discrepancies between experimental and non-relativistic calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
