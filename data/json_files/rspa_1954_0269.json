They found that multiple exchange by repeated second-point adsorption occurred, and the activation energies and frequency factors of the reactions were determined. The results showed that the cyclic hydrocarbons' adsorption on metal surfaces played a crucial role in the exchange reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
