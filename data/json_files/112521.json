Lassell discusses his observations and analysis of the Great Nebula in Orion. He compares his own observations made with a four-foot equatorial telescope to Lord Oxmantown's recent observations and drawings published in the Transactions of the Royal Society. Lassell also shares his thoughts on the resolvability of the nebula and the potential influence of atmospheric conditions on such observations. He provides a detailed account of the stars he observed within the nebula and offers his original drawing for comparison and study."}
