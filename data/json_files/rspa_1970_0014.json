The study involves a viscoelastic string as a model for the transmitting medium, and the results can be applied to various systems, including nonlinear transmission lines, nonlinear dielectric materials, and relaxing and reacting gas mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave Propagation"}
