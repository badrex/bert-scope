The study suggests that calcium ions entering the cell during the light response play a significant role in determining the response's kinetics. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of phototransduction in invertebrate rhabdomeric photoreceptors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
