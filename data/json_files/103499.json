They critique existing explanations and propose an alternative hypothesis based on the action of the sun on water, which forms small water particles into hollow spheres filled with rarefied air. This theory explains how these spheres rise and eventually form rain.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
