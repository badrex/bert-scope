They discovered two Rydberg series converging towards the 9S4 and 7S3 levels of the configuration 4f76s in Eu n. The first series is perturbed near the series limit, and the second series shows strong autoionization features. A value of 45,734.9 + 0.2 cm-1 is deduced for the first ionization limit. The authors also found unusual autoionization features between the 9S and 7S ionization limits and determined new values for these limits.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
