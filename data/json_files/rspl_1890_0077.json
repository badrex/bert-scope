They argue that there is a membranous structure behind the posterior layer of the lens capsule, which is distinct from the vitreous substance. This discovery is important for understanding the anatomy of the eye and has implications for ophthalmological practice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
