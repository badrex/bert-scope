He discovers that the electricity is not solely due to metallic contact but is also influenced by chemical actions. Faraday's experiments with amalgamated zinc and platina plates demonstrate that the voltaic current can be generated without direct metallic contact, and he establishes a connection between the chemical affinities of the fluids involved and the direction of the electric current.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
