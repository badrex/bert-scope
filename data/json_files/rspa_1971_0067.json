They introduce a transfer-matrix approach to calculate the Whitney polynomial and provide exact solutions for certain limiting cases of the percolation problem in the plane square lattice. The study has implications for various physical and technical problems involving repeating networks and crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Graph Theory"}
