They observed dark bands corresponding to the layers and lines between them due to the perovskite A cations. The lattice images revealed dislocations and domain boundaries in the crystals for the first time. The study provides insights into the microstructure and properties of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
