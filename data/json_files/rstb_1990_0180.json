This method allows for handling variability and provides estimates of the likelihood of environmental events occurring in designated areas. The process uses Fourier Amplitude Sensitivity Test and Monte Carlo sampling techniques to drive environmental models and generate frequency distribution data for output, making it useful for evaluating environmental impact and best management practices.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry"}
