They found that the peptide has a molecular mass of approximately 1600 Da and is composed of glutamic acid, cysteine, and glycine. The phytochelatin's role in copper tolerance in Mimulus guttatus is suggested by the reduced growth of roots when exposed to both copper and the inhibitor buthionine sulphoximine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
