They discovered various types of neurons, including smooth, sparsely spiny, and spiny neurons resembling pyramidal cells. The density of neurons in layer 1 is sufficient to sample the entire representation of the visual field in area 17, providing new insights into the neuronal composition of the adult cat visual cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
