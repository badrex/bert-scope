The model, considering multiple polygenic viability-related traits, shows that choosiness will be favored with any positive mutation rate, but the advantage is slightly reduced in the case of a Red Queen type process. This result implies confidence in viability indicators as an explanation for female preferences in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
