The author analyzes the geological data on both sides of the Gulf of Aden and reconstructs the pre-separation positions of the area to study the geological features and correlations between the two sides. The study provides insights into the tectonic history and the ongoing processes shaping the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
