The reptile is closely related to living species Chelydra, Gypochelys, and Platysternum. The discovery of this reptile is significant as it represents a group of Chelonia not previously found in the Australian fauna. The author also discusses the analysis of the reptile's bones, skull, and caudal sheaths, and compares them to other known species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
