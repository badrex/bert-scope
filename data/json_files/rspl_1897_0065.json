They found that when a fluorescent substance, like uranium glass, transmits light from another fluorescing body, the amount of light transmitted appears different depending on whether the substance is fluorescing or not. This phenomenon was demonstrated through various experiments and photographic methods, providing evidence of a change in absorption due to fluorescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
