The authors observed structure in the total cross section near the threshold region, which they interpreted as resonant s-wave scattering from the 2 3S state. They also measured the relative total metastable production cross section for energies ranging from the 2 3S threshold to the ionization potential, revealing resonant structures associated with the = 3 and = 4 states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
