The authors discuss the phenomenon of attenuation, particularly the decrease in solar radiation intensity as it passes through Earth's atmosphere. They also introduce a term to account for the increase in temperature due to the conversion of radiant energy into molecular agitation. The study has applications in atmospheric and astrophysics, as well as climate science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
