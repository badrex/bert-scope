They find that the \"acid effect\" is very marked in this compound, and the dispersion is considered anomalous. The authors also investigate the effects of neutralization and discuss the behavior of different derivatives in terms of their absorption bands and rotatory power.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
