It shows that the presence of certain terms in the asymptotic expansion of the metric is natural and does not lead to significant difficulties in analyzing the geometry. The study also demonstrates the validity of the Bondi mass loss formula and the peeling-off property of the Riemann tensor in the polyhomogeneous case.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
