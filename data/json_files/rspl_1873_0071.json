They found that the two diseases have a similar pathogeny and that fresh lymph contains spheroidal bodies, which are in organic continuity with micrococci. This study contributes to our understanding of the infective process and the pathology of smallpox.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
