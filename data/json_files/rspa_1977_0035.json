Quantization", "semantic_tags": ["Celestial Mechanics", "Quantum Mechanics", "Atomic Physics", "Semiclassical Mechanics", "Planetary Systems"], "tldr": "The authors study planetary atoms, which are atoms or ions with two or more excited electrons, using celestial dynamics and E.B.K. quantization. They explore the connection between classical mechanics and quantum states, and discuss the challenges and potential of this approach in understanding planetary atoms' energy spectrum and dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
