They derived a solution for the thermal conduction equation of a composite circular cylinder, which provides a theoretical basis for this technique. The method preserves the samples and offers insights into the understanding of heat transportation mechanisms in the lunar regolith.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
