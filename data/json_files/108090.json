The author finds that the diurnal inequality can be accurately represented by taking the moon's declination four days prior to the observation. The study also highlights the significant diurnal inequality of low water at Singapore, which has implications for coastal navigation and geography.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
