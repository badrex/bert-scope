The technique involves controlling variables such as dilution, quantity of blood, time for hemolysis, and temperature. The method is applied to various hemolytic substances, including saponin, sodium taurocholate, and lactic acid, and the results are expressed through mathematical equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
