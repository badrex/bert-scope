The author proposes a hypothesis that explains the Earth's figure and provides a basis for research into geological history. The study also explores the effects of pressures on the Earth's structure and the potential for fissures to form in the solid shell.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
