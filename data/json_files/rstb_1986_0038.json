The research compares the healing process under stable and unstable mechanical conditions, using metal and plastic plates for immobilization. The results show that mechanical stability affects the composition and size of the periosteal callus and the time required for union across a fracture gap. The study emphasizes the importance of maintaining mechanical stability for proper fracture healing and provides a basis for future experimental studies on fracture healing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
