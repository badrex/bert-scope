Walker. These observations aimed to provide independent information on the Earth's figure and local variations of gravity. The results were of great importance and fulfilled the purposes intended by the Royal Society. The article also highlights the methods and challenges faced during the observations and the need for further supplementary measures to complete the operations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
