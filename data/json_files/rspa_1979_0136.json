They find that the amplitude and phase of the wave can be determined to the second order in the perturbation parameter, and that a certain constraint on the coefficients leads to an exact solution. The study also discusses the conservation laws related to the wave's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
