They include new terms in the evolution equation for the wave amplitude and take into account the mean flow caused by the radiation stress of the modulated wave. The study shows that the dominant effect comes from the induced mean flow, which changes the stability properties of the wave train.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
