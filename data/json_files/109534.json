He experimented with different liquids to view the Sun without darkening glasses, finding that diluted ink provided a clear image. Herschel inferred that these observations supported the connection between the Sun's emission and the temperature of Earth's atmosphere, and he hoped that astronomy could provide accurate predictions of seasonal temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
