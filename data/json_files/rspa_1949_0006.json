They found the heat of hydrolysis of cadmium dimethyl by water and dilute H2SO4, and the heat of reaction of cadmium dimethyl and I2 in ethereal solution. This study helps in understanding the bond energies and the formation of RI compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermochemistry"}
