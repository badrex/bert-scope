They found that the frequency of synaptic profiles increased until one day post-eclosion and then declined. Exposing young adult flies to different visual stimuli caused changes in synaptic frequencies, demonstrating that the L2 feedback synapse is plastic during the first four days of adult life. These findings contribute to our understanding of neural development and the visual system in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
