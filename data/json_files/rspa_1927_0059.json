They observed that salt solutions can draw up water against the opposition of gravity and that the tractor action of salt solutions is more effective on albuminous solutions. The author also discussed the limitations and criticisms of their experiments and proposed ways to improve the study of intertraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
