The goal was to explore and study the deep sea south of Europe and the Mediterranean. The expedition aimed to collect samples, investigate the relationship between the Mediterranean and Atlantic seas, and study the distribution of animal life and geological formations at various depths. The findings from this expedition contributed significantly to the understanding of marine life, ocean currents, and the Earth's geological history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
