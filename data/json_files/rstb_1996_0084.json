They found that a single locus genetic model fitted the data better than a non-genetic model, providing the first statistical evidence of genetic variation in susceptibility to BSE. This study aimed to identify potential genetic factors that could be further investigated at the molecular level to better understand the disease and its transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Disease"}
