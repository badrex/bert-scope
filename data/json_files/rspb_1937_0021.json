They found that these tissues share similar systems, such as the phosphagen and adenylpyrophosphate, which play a crucial role in muscle function. This research has significant implications for understanding the evolution and distribution of phosphagens in different organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
