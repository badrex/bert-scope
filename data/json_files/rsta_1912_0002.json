The authors found that as pressure increased, the lines in the spectra broadened, shifted towards the red end of the spectrum, and showed a greater tendency towards reversal. The study also observed changes in the color of the arc as pressure increased, with the arc becoming white at higher pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
