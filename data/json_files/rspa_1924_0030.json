They find that succinic acid has a monoclinic lattice with two molecules in the unit cell, while succinic anhydride and succinimide have an orthorhombic lattice. The molecular symmetry and arrangement of atoms in these compounds are discussed, revealing similarities and differences in their crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
