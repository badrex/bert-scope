The research reveals a high initial excretion rate that rapidly declines, followed by a second peak during the first day of adult life. The low rate of excretion that follows signifies the establishment of full flight activity, mating, and feeding in the female mosquito.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
