He worked primarily in industrial laboratories but conducted fundamental research on polymers and crystal structures. Bunn was known for his unique approach, using optical and non-X-ray methods to solve structural problems. He was elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society in 1967 and received the Ford Prize from the American Physical Society in 1969 for his work on natural and synthetic regular polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
