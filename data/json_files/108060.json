This lens increases the magnifying power of the telescope without increasing the diameter of the micrometer wires, providing a significant advantage when observing minute double stars. The lens also improves the field of view and reduces the strain on the observer's eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics"}
