The gas is found to be composed of about 10% oxygen and 90% nitrogen, with no signs of flammability or smell of sulfur. The author speculates that the gas may have originated from the sea water interacting with the hot volcanic materials, rather than directly from the volcano itself.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
