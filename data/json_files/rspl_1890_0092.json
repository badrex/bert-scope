They discover that these muscle-columns are made up of continuous substance with tubular canals, and the longitudinal striation is due to this canalization. The author also explains the physical changes that occur during muscle contraction and extension.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
