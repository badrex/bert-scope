They find that the force of a muscle is proportional to the area of its cross-section, and the force is also proportional to the cross-section of the tendon conveying its influence to a distant point. However, the ratio of muscle to tendon cross-sections varies depending on the friction experienced by the tendons. The author provides examples from human subjects, a Pyrenean Mastiff, and a Wallaby Kangaroo to support their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomechanics"}
