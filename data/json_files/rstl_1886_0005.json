They discovered that irregularities in previous experiments were due to imperfect lubrication and temperature effects. By considering the viscosity of the oil and the temperature, the author explains the phenomena observed in Tower's experiments and provides a theoretical framework for understanding lubrication in practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
