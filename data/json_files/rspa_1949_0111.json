They explain the film's thickness variation with height and temperature, and suggest a new interpretation of the rate of helium transfer through the film. The theory accounts for the film's unique properties and its behavior in equilibrium with liquid above and below the critical point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
