The researchers found that apparent diffusion rates in biofilms were highly dependent on biofilm preparation, with sucrose-starved biofilms showing a slowdown in diffusion. The FRAP approach provides a convenient method for determining diffusion rates within bacterial biofilms, which can have implications for understanding biofilm permeability and the effectiveness of antibacterial agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
