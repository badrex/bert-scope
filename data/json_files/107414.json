He studied the properties of silicated fluoric acid gas, liquid fluoric acid, and fluo-boric acid gas, and their reactions with metals. The author discussed three hypotheses on the nature of fluoric combinations and provided experimental evidence to support the idea that liquid fluoric acid does not contain water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fluorine chemistry"}
