By comparing the observations of the first satellite of Jupiter made at Wansted and Lisbon, he calculated the difference in longitude between the two cities. This method involved using telescopes, time measurements, and accounting for the irregular motion of the satellite due to the gravitational influence of other satellites.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Satellite observation"}
