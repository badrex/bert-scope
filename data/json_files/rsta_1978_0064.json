The authors develop an efficient numerical method that combines a pseudospectral (Fourier transform) treatment of the spatial dependence with a leapfrog scheme in time. They apply this method to investigate solitary wave interactions, wave breaking, the resolution of initial steps and wells, and the development of nonlinear wave train instabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
