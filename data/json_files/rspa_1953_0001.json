The authors generalize the theory to apply to all excited states, taking advantage of the symmetry properties of wave functions in three-dimensional and six-dimensional space. The study focuses on singlet and triplet states of diatomic molecules with similar and dissimilar atoms, providing a basis for calculating their properties and interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
