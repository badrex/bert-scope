These isoantigens are found on thymocytes and lymphocytes and are determined by two genetic loci. The study found that each system has only two alleles, and none of the four loci (H-2, 0, Ly-A, and Ly-B) are closely linked. The research provides a foundation for understanding the complex world of lymphocyte isoantigens and their role in the immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
