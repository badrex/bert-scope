They discover that platinum can selectively react with certain gases, allowing for the separation and identification of components in gaseous mixtures. This research has implications for understanding and controlling chemical reactions, as well as for the development of new analytical techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
