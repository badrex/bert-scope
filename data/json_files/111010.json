Brodie, investigates the chemical nature of wax, focusing on the difficult-to-solve portion of beeswax called myricine. He discovers palmitic acid, a new wax-alcohol called melissine, and a solid hydrocarbon called melene. Brodie concludes that waxes are chemically related to fatty bodies and are part of a larger chemical series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
