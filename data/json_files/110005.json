The results showed that the pendulum made 86166,078 vibrations in twenty-four hours. By comparing this with the length of a pendulum vibrating seconds in London, the author calculated the ellipticity of the Earth, which is very close to the mean deduced from other observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
