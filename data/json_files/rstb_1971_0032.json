It highlights the limitations of specimen preparation and mounting, as well as the transfer function of the electron microscope. The author describes an experimental instrument that aims to extend the spatial information content obtainable from weakly scattering biological materials. The article also explores the potential of thin crystalline substrate films for supporting biomacromolecules and the use of digital computer processing or optical filtering to enhance image contrast.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
