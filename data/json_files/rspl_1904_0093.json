The author describes the teeth of this small proboscidean, including incisors, milk molars, and permanent molars, and highlights the lateral compression of the tusks as a distinguishing characteristic. The study also suggests that Elephas Cypriotes was isolated and differentiated earlier than other Mediterranean dwarf elephants, possibly due to Cyprus becoming an island at an earlier time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
