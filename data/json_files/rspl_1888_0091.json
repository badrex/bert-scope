The research finds that the Australian spine has a more pronounced lumbar curve, similar to the curve in European females. The lumbar curve in Australians is due to the wedge-shaped form of intervertebral disks, while Europeans have a more uniform curve. The study also highlights the differences in the axial curve composition and the importance of cartilage in the lumbar region of the vertebral column.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Anatomy"}
