They discovered that colorless bodies can have varying levels of permeability to chemical rays, and that some substances, like rock-crystal, ice, and pure water, are highly diactinic, or transparent to these rays. The author also studied the absorbent effects of gases and vapors on the chemical spectrum, finding that some, like coal-gas and sulfur compounds, have a strong absorbent action.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
