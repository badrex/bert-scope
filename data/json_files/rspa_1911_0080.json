They discover that oxygen destroys the nitrogen afterglow, and that the greenish-yellow glow resulting from the reaction between active nitrogen and nitric oxide is due to the nitrogen peroxide molecule. The author also explores the electrical conductivity of glowing nitrogen and the origin of ions in the glowing nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
