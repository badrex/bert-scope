The instrument uses a compact glass tube with two legs connected to separate cisterns filled with water and oil. By adjusting the oil-water mixture, the instrument can detect even the slightest changes in air pressure, making it useful for measuring wind forces and understanding how air moves through spaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
