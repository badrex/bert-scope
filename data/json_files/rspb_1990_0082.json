The mice expressed the foreign class I molecules on thymic medullary stromal cells, which were unable to positively select T cells for passage to the periphery. The mice were tolerant of the cell types expressing the foreign Kb molecules and were also tolerant of Kb presented as skin grafts. This suggests that not all components of thymic epithelium are involved in positive selection of T cells and that transplantation antigens expressed on non-dendritic cells can induce tolerance.", "scientific_discipline": "Immunology > T-cell development"}
