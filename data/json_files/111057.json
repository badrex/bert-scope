W. Hofmann, conducted research on the molecular constitution of volatile organic bases. They found that ammonia can lose 1, 2, or 3 equivalents of hydrogen, which are replaced by equivalents of the same or various compound radicals. This results in a variety of substances with a basic character, modified by the number of radicals and their position in the organic compounds. The author also introduced a method to create thirteen new organic alkaloids and demonstrated how ammonia undergoes changes in these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
