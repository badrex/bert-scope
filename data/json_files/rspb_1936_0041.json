They found that muscle haemoglobin has a hyperbolic dissociation curve and a faster rate of combination compared to blood haemoglobin. The study also showed that muscle haemoglobin satisfies the minimum postulates for a primitive respiratory pigment, making it an essential component in muscle function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
