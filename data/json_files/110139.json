Due to the intense cold, they found it difficult to use certain instruments. They eventually used a modified method proposed by Lieutenant Foster and Captain Parry, which involved observing the moments of star disappearance and measuring the zenith distances of boards. This allowed them to gather a series of observations on the moments of disappearance and reappearance of stars, providing valuable data for navigation and polar exploration.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
