The author demonstrates that the electric organs of these animals are composed of numerous elementary organs, and that under nervous influence, the two opposite electricities separate and re-unite. The author also establishes a connection between the intensity of the nervous force and the electric discharge, and shows the relation between nervous influence and electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
