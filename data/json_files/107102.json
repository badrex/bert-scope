He discovered a new method of preparing the powder using a \"humid way\" process, which resulted in a more homogeneous and constant composition. This new method involved dissolving equal parts of white oxide of antimony and phosphate of lime in muriatic acid and then pouring the solution into an alkaline liquid. The author also found that increasing the proportion of oxide of antimony in the powder increased its medicinal power.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Pharmaceutical Chemistry"}
