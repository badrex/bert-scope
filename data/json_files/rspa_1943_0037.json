They analyzed the spectra of vinyl halides, chloroprene, and chlorinated paraffins, providing valuable information about normal vibration frequencies. The study helps in understanding the correlation between vibrational spectra and molecular structure, contributing to the field of polymer chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
