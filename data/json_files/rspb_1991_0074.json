The channels have a unitary conductance of 135 pS and are found in a small proportion of membrane patches. They activate gradually over 10 seconds and deactivate in a slow, voltage-dependent manner. These channels may contribute to spike frequency adaptation, post-stimulus hyperpolarization, and cell repolarization during the excitatory response to odorants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
