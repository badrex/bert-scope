The author presents the ring-spiral algorithm and magic number rules to predict and count possible isomers and their properties. The article also discusses the stability and selection rules for interconversion of fullerenes and related structures, such as doped fullerenes, metallocarbohedrenes, and decorated-fullerene models for water clusters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
