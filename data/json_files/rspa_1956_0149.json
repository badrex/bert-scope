They propose a model based on conduction by free electrons and the presence of electron traps, which explains the phenomenon and is in good agreement with experimental results. The study also explores the dependence of induced conductivity and its decay on temperature and dose rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
