The method uses Fourier integral transforms and provides alternative forms of solution for different regions, including the illuminated and shadow regions. This approach offers a relatively easy and straightforward application of Fourier integral transforms to the problem, leading to new developments and applications in related problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
