He explains how these substances affect the lines of force in a magnetic field and how they influence the position and attraction of other materials within the field. This research contributes to the understanding of electromagnetic interactions and the behavior of materials in magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
