The presence of viral pathogens, such as barley yellow dwarf virus, creates an advantage for rare or sexually produced genotypes. This suggests that viral pathogens play a significant role in plant populations and may be responsible for maintaining genetic variation and sexual reproduction in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
