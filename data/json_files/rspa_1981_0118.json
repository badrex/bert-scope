The authors develop two particle growth models, COAG and CONCO, based on various assumptions about condensation and nucleation. These models help predict the observed rates of increase in scattered-light intensity and provide insights into soot formation processes. The study demonstrates the validity of postulates related to the absorption and emission of gas-phase polynuclear aromatic hydrocarbons, which are intermediates in the soot formation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
