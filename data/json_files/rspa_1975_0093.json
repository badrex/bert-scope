They discovered that type Ia diamonds changed color to yellow due to scattering from elliptically shaped cracks in the cube planes. The study also provided evidence for bond breaking and crack formation at edge dislocations in type IIa diamonds. Prolonged heating led to a significant reduction in the strength of both types of diamonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Crystallography"}
