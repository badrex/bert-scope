They tested greensand, silver sand, powdered glass, brickdust, coke, animal charcoal, and spongy iron. The results showed that spongy iron and animal charcoal were the most effective in removing microorganisms from water, while coke and brickdust also demonstrated significant filtering powers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Water Treatment"}
