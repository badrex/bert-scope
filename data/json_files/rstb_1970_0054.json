The author examines the historical context of freemartin research and proposes a new understanding of the condition. The freemartin is a result of vascular anastomosis between the foetal circulations of dizygotic twins of unlike sex, leading to an interchange of cells and substances. This causes partial sex reversal of the female gonad, resulting in the secretion of male-type hormones and masculinization of the freemartin. The author suggests that the true explanation of the freemartin condition is a partial sex reversal of the female gonad due to the retention of some medullary tissue, which starts to secrete male-type hormones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Reproduction"}
