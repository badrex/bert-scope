The author measures the adsorption of benzene, acetone, and methyl alcohol vapors at various temperatures and pressures. The results show that the adsorption potential and thermal expansion of the films are influenced by the molecular properties of the adsorbate, such as polarity and polarizability. The findings provide insights into the behavior of adsorption systems and the role of surface chemistry in thermal properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
