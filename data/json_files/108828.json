Walker, investigates earth-currents during a period of magnetic calm. He uses a small horizontal galvanometer to observe the direction and strength of these currents along different telegraph lines. The results show that the prevailing currents are from the northeast or southwest, and the author speculates that these currents may be influenced by local meteorological changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
