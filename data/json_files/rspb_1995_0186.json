They found evidence of a latitudinal gradient in density dependence, with southern populations experiencing stronger direct density dependence than northern populations. The results support the \"generalist predator hypothesis,\" which suggests that increased abundance and diversity of generalist predators in the south lead to more stabilized dynamics and shorter cycle lengths in rodent populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology", "sub_discipline": "Population Ecology"}
