They found that high-energy dislocations and indigenous or created vacancies in the surface act as active centers for oxidation. The studies help identify the actual structural defects that function as active centers and evaluate the degree of enhanced reactivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
