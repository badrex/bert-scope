They propose that the variability is produced by the revolution of one or more smaller swarms around the central swarm, with maximum luminosity occurring at periastron passages. This theory explains the differences in period and range of variability in these celestial bodies. The author further tests their theory by analyzing color observations and the question of irregularity in selected stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
