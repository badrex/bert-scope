They also studied the electronic spectra of these complexes and found a correlation between the nuclear resonance frequencies and the spectrochemical series of the ligands. The results provide insights into the electronic shielding of the cobalt nucleus and improve the value of the cobalt nuclear moment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
