The method provides an alternative to X-ray diffraction and can be applied to various layer structures with specific fault types. The study examines the effect of stacking faults on the reciprocal lattice and demonstrates the potential of the optical method for further research on faulted layer structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
