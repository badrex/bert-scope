The author proposes a new model in which the Y chromosome acts cell-autonomously to bring about Sertoli-cell differentiation, suggesting that sex determination is equivalent to Sertoli-cell determination. The findings of Page et al. (1987) support this model, as their research identified a candidate testis-determining sequence on the human Y chromosome, which is compatible with either of the models presented in the article.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
