Measurements were made on a series of lead specimens, including single crystals and polycrystals, with and without added impurities. The results confirmed that below a certain temperature, thermal current is carried entirely by lattice waves and is not scattered by conduction electrons. This discovery has implications for understanding the theory of superconductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
