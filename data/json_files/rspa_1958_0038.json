They analyzed the rotational structure of the bands and found that the molecule is likely linear or has a symmetric top configuration. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and electronic states of the carbon disulphide ion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
