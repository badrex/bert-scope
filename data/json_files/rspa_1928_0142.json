They found that the bands do not follow a simple harmonic ratio, indicating a more complex movement in these molecules. The authors also discussed the relationship between the intensity of neighboring bands and the deviations from simple harmonic ratios. Their findings contribute to the understanding of molecular structure and the role of rotation in these gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
