The research explains the response of the contact region as a result of the heat generated in the constriction resistance by the current. The critical constriction resistance associated with any current has been found to be inversely proportional to the magnitude of the current. The results indicate that when a short pulse of current passes between the pieces of metal, mechanical collapse will occur only if the current is large enough to cause melting of the metal near the interface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
