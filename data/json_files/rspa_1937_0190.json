They found that the irreversible heating in the substance increased as the temperature decreased and was proportional to the square of the applied amplitude and the frequency of the alternating current. The results provide insights into the behavior of magnetic materials and the potential for improving temperature measurement methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetic Materials"}
