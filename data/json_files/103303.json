He described the appearance of the phenomenon, including the light's arch shape, the vertical streams of light, and the black substance at the base. Folkes also mentioned the ground's odd mist and the difference between this phenomenon and regular clouds. His observations provide valuable insights into early understanding of atmospheric and geomagnetic phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
