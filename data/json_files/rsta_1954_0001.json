They use a method of finite sections and spectral resolution to analyze the solutions and explore asymptotic values and ergodic properties. The study also confirms a result and a conjecture by D.G. Kendall in the theory of queues.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": ">-"}
