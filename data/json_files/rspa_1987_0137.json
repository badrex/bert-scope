The key step involves solving the matrix-valued Riemann problem on the Riemann sphere, which is expressed as a path-ordered exponential contour integral. This work has implications for understanding the physics of Yang-Mills fields and solving other nonlinear differential equations in physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
