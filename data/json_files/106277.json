He discovered that air plays a crucial role in respiration, and the blood absorbs a principle called phlogiston from the air. This principle changes the color of the blood and affects its properties. Priestley's findings challenged previous theories about respiration and paved the way for further research on the role of oxygen in animal life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
