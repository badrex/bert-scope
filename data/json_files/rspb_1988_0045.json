The results show that STa enterotoxin induces a rapid and reversible alkalinization of the jejunal and ileal mucosae. The findings suggest that cyclic-GMP-dependent secretory processes are more capable of inducing surface pH changes than those dependent on cyclic AMP, making STa a useful tool to investigate the microclimate hypothesis for weak electrolyte absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
