The authors study the cases when the associated differential equation is singular at one end-point and in the strong-limit-point case, or when both end-points of the interval are regular. They establish a framework for analyzing the HELP inequalities in these circumstances and obtain results that resemble those in previous work on the regular and limit-circle cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
