The results showed that the intensity ratio of the strong to weak rotational lines in the bands 4900 \u00c5, 4838 \u00c5, and 6554 \u00c5 was 1.63. The optical determination of the relative abundance of isotopes found a ratio of lithium-6 to lithium-7 that was not in agreement with the ratio calculated from the atomic weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
