They found that these vortices start a new furrow and ridge, which leads to the creation of more ripples. The authors also suggested that similar processes might be responsible for the formation of tidal ridges, sand dunes, and cloud patterns in the sky.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
