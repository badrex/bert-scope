The authors analyze the flow structure using an analytical technique and Laplace transform solutions, finding that wall roughness is inefficient in stimulating small wavelength G\u00f6rtler vortices. They also demonstrate that the initial conditions for numerical solutions need to be amended, providing new insights into the development of vortices in boundary layer flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
