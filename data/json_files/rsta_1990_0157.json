FANES combines a hollow cathode discharge inside an electrothermal atomizer tube, allowing for the excitation of both non-metals and metallic impurities. The technique has been applied to the determination of elements such as B, Cl, P, and Si in industrial and clinical samples, demonstrating its potential for improved sensitivity and analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
