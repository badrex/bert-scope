The SSU is a 3-channel infrared radiometer that uses the selective chopping technique to achieve sharp weighting functions within the stratosphere. The retrieved data is used to monitor the in-flight performance of the instrument and to provide stratospheric temperature analyses.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
