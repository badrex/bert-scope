This technique measures the volumetric flow rate of the stream leaving a chromatographic column, allowing for a more accurate analysis of the sample. The authors describe the theoretical development, design, and a severe experimental test of the method, highlighting its advantages over conventional gas chromatography.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
