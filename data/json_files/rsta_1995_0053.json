It presents a macroscopic modeling approach and a stochastic cellular automaton model for simulating grain structure formation in solidification processes. The models help predict the microstructural features and crystallographic textures of high-temperature materials, such as superalloys, used in aerospace applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Solidification and Microstructure Modeling"}
