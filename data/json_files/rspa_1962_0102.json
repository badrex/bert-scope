They found that the effective valency of transition metals decreases with an increase in electron-to-atom ratio and transition metal content. The results demonstrate the dependence of effective valencies on the exact nature of the environment of the dissolved atoms in these alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
