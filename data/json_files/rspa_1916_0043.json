They discovered that the Bunsen flame can excite the fundamental frequencies of these elements, with the exception of zinc. The authors found that the Bunsen flame spectra of mercury, cadmium, and magnesium showed strong intensity for the fundamental frequencies, while zinc failed to produce any characteristic lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
