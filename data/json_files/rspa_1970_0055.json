They tested their method on various compounds and found that their results were in closer agreement with experimental data compared to previous methods. This approach can be extended to other heteroconjugated systems, such as compounds containing boron, fluorine, and third row elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
