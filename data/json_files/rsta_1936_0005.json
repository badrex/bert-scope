They discuss the magnetic anisotropy and the influence of crystalline electric fields on the energy levels of the ions. The study includes measurements on single crystals of manganous and ferric salts, and the results are related to entropy and specific heat at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
