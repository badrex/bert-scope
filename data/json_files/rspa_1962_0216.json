They discovered that the initial step involves the abstraction of a hydrogen atom from propane by nitric oxide, and the termination reaction is between HNO and a propyl radical. The results show that the fully inhibited decompositions of propane and other hydrocarbons are not molecular reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
