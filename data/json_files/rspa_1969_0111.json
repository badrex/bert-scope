They measured the integral rotation of the directional correlation and found the effective internal field. The study also determined the gyromagnetic factors and mixing ratios of the transitions in the 624 rotational band of Hf, providing insights into the properties of deformed nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
