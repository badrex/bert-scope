They study the mummy's construction, comparing it to ancient accounts, and analyze the preservation techniques used. The mummy's outer covering consists of linen cloth and paint, with no traces of hair or skin remaining. The bones were found to be covered in pitch, and the cavity of the thorax was filled with a mixture of crumbled pitch and splinters of bone. The researchers discovered that the mummy had been poorly repaired, with clumsy workmanship and inadequate preservation methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
