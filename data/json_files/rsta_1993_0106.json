The authors find that on the surface of highly doped n-type GaAs(001), there is a high density of kinks in the dimer-vacancy rows of the (2x4) reconstruction, which act as surface acceptors. These kinks pin the Fermi-level of n-type GaAs(001) at an acceptor level close to the mid-gap, regardless of doping level. In contrast, p-type GaAs(001) experiences Fermi-level pinning due to intrinsic surface defects such as step edges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Science"}
