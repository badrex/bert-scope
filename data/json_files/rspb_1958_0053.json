They analyzed the data from three crosses and found that the two closely linked pairs of markers had a significant effect on viability. The results showed that the data agreed with a ratio of 1:2:1, indicating a balanced distribution of genetic markers. This study helps to understand the genetic interactions and recombination in fungi.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
