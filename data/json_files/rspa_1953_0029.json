They found that the second moment of the measured spectrum, which indicates molecular structure, is consistent with a structure having symmetry, tetrahedral bond angles, and specific bond lengths. The study also revealed changes in the second moment and spin-lattice relaxation time as the temperature increased, providing insights into the molecular motion and structure of cyclohexane.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid State Chemistry"}
