They introduce the concept of a coalition-tree to describe coalition structures and propose a new approach to finding the optimal tree representing the chosen structure. The study focuses on linear distribution methods and provides solutions for 3-player games, while highlighting the complexity of 4-player games.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Game Theory"}
