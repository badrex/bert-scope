They found that conditions leading to increased sodium and water uptake, such as the presence of protoveratrine or ouabain, or the absence of glucose, enhanced the frequency of the spontaneous action potentials. Amino acids like L-glutamate, D-glutamate, and L-aspartate also increased the frequency, while inhibitory amino acids like GABA, glycine, and taurine, or substances like ammonium ions and pentobarbital, decreased it. This study provides a means to correlate neurochemical data with electrophysiological data and assess the effects of amino acids on cerebellar electrical activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
