They argue that convincing evidence for extraterrestrial protolife exists in the organic geochemistry and fossil contents of these meteorites. The author also examines the geological record to investigate the existence of prebiological food and heterotrophic life on Earth, and the relationship between protolife and the origin of photosynthesis. The search for protolife and the study of extraterrestrial organic compounds can provide insights into the origins of life in the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Astrobiology"}
