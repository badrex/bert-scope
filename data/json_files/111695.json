The author discusses the effects of permanent and induced magnetism, the quadrantal deviation, and the changes in magnetic force over time. The findings can help improve compass adjustments and ensure the safety of navigation in iron-built ships.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Engineering"}
