W. Richardson and T. Tanaka, study the secondary spectrum of hydrogen and discover regularities in the lines of the spectrum. They analyze the lines, their intensities, and the relationships between them, leading to a better understanding of the behavior of atoms and the development of quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
