They analyze the enzyme suicide-substrate reaction and the Michaelis-Menten reaction, showing that the region where the QSSA holds depends on space and time. This study provides a more accurate analysis for a wide range of biochemically relevant problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
