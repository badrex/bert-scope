It presents a revised stratigraphy and interprets the orogenic events that occurred between 1050 and 550 million years ago, including three main episodes of tectonic activity, volcanic and sedimentary deposition, and plutonic rock formation. The study suggests that cratonization evolved in an intraoceanic, island-arc environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
