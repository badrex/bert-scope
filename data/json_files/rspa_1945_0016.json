The authors use fundamental stress functions to calculate stress concentrations near the hole and compare the results with those for isotropic materials. The study focuses on wood, specifically oak and spruce, and provides numerical values for stress concentrations in different scenarios. The findings can help predict failure types near holes in highly stressed wood plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
