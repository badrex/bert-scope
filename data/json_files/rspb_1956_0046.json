The authors analyze four characters with major effects and mono-Mendelian segregations, such as foliar glands, flesh color, and corolla size, to understand the genetic structure and adaptation of these plants to different environments and selection pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
