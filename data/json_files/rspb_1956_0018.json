The research found that horses are highly sensitive to adrenaline, which causes profuse sweating and a decrease in skin temperature. The study also discovered distinct sweating tracks following the lines of superficial lymphatic vessels, which have not been previously described. This research sheds light on the horse's sweating mechanism and its potential implications for tropical anhidrosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
