They describe the orbital program for satellites at the Astrophysical Observatory of the Smithsonian Institution, which includes routines for determining approximate orbits, improving orbits using differential corrections, and generating ephemerides. The method accounts for various factors such as drag, perturbations, and station positions, making it useful for predicting satellite movements and tracking their positions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
