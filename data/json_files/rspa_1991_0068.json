The authors develop an amended Lindemann rule, which provides a more accurate estimate of melting temperatures. They also categorize elements as normal or anomalous based on their entropy of fusion and analyze the factors affecting melting, such as anharmonicity, crystal symmetry, and electronic groundstate changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
