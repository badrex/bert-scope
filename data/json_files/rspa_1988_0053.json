The research focuses on the kinematics and dynamics of impact, revealing high impulsive pressures and the role of trapped air in pressure oscillations. The findings highlight the importance of understanding the impact process and its implications for ocean structures and marine vehicles.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
