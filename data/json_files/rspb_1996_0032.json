Factors controlling this developmental choice have been investigated using isofemale lines of the parasite. The results show that environmental conditions, such as temperature and culture conditions, can affect the proportion of larvae that develop homogonically or heterogonically. The study also highlights the role of conditions within the host in determining homogonic or heterogonic development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
