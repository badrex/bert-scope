The author explains how this stress system can lead to plate-boundary forces, such as ridge push, slab pull, and trench suction. The study uses elastic-viscoelastic finite-element modeling to analyze the effects of sublithospheric loading and associated flexural topography.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
