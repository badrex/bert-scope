The authors derive an equation to describe this effect and verify it through experiments using rubber hemispheres pressed against a glass flat. The results show a clear reduction in contact area with increasing tangential force, supporting the theoretical conclusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
