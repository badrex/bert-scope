They used spherical steel projectiles to simulate the erosion process and found that the physical process of metal removal is unaffected by scaling over a range of particle sizes and material densities. This research provides a basis for understanding and reducing wear in machinery and improving erosion as a tool.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
