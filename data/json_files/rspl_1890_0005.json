They discovered that the mixture separates into two different ternary alloys of unequal density depending on the proportion of the third metal, C. The solubility of the metals in each other varies with the nature of the third metal and the temperature. The authors provide detailed solubility values for various lead-zinc-tin mixtures and discuss the effect of temperature on the solubility.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
