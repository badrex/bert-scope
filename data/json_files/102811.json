He explains that the obstruction of glands can cause fevers and that crude or vitiated chyle can be a factor. Lister shares his experiment's success with Dr. Musgrave, who also conducted similar experiments at Oxford. Lister emphasizes the importance of doing justice to one's own work and maintaining a fair representation of experiments in scientific interpretations."}
