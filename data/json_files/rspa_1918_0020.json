They propose that the measure of standard temperature can be selected based on this theorem, and that the motive power of a heat engine arises from the fall of heat through a range of temperature. The kinetic energies of molecules in an element of mass mix together rapidly, leading to an equilibrium of distribution. The energy at a dead level of temperature can be recovered or reconstituted into mechanical energy by exploiting the further effort towards equalization of temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
