They discovered that bacteria produce a soluble enzyme that can dissolve gelatin without the need for active bacterial growth. The study also found that the enzyme's action can be isolated and demonstrated on other protein-rich substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
