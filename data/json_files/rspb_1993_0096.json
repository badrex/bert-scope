These conditions include a host population structure that approximates a metapopulation, high levels of dispersal for hosts or parasites, and parasites dispersing independently of their hosts. A computer simulation demonstrates that a large difference between host and parasite dispersal rates favors an obligately asexual host reproductive strategy over an obligately sexual one. This hypothesis may explain the persistence of anciently asexual taxa and the patterns of dispersal seen in obligately asexual groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
