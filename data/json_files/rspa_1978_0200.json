The authors develop a method that applies uniformly and accurately to all values of the quantum number and anharmonicity constant, providing eigenvalues and eigenfunctions for various anharmonic oscillators. This method has implications for understanding quantum field theory and molecular physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
