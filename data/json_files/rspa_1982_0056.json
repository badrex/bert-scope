They develop a model to describe the process of particle settling and derive a set of Langevin equations for the Fourier modes of the surface, which implies that the surface fluctuations behave like the velocities of independent Brownian particles. The model helps explain the logarithmically divergent surface fluctuations and provides insights into the dynamics of the surface as more material is added.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter"}
