They found that both types of venom cause similar physiological effects, such as depression, hurried respiration, exhaustion, and muscle paralysis, ultimately leading to death. However, they observed a greater tendency for local and general hemorrhages in animals poisoned by crotaline venom compared to colubrine venom.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
