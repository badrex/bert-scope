Two types of induced dichroism are distinguished: one-photon allowed transitions and two-photon allowed transitions. The theory explains how the differential absorption rates, optical rotation, and circular differential scattering intensities are affected by the intensity of the inducing laser beam. The findings have implications for nonlinear spectroscopy and the study of atomic and molecular optical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
