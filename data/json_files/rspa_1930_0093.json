They propose a mechanism where electrons either interact with the crystal structure or with free electrons, leading to the emission of secondary electrons and the production of soft X-rays. The author discusses two alternatives for the generation of true secondary electrons and suggests further experiments to test their validity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
