The study reveals the active site of the enzyme and proposes a ping-pong mechanism for its reaction, with two histidine residues participating in the phosphoryl transfer. The C-terminal region also plays a crucial role in the enzymatic reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
