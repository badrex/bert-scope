They propose a model that considers the simplest approximation of defect interactions and show that a crystalline phase is stable only within a limited range of compositions. This model helps predict the occurrence of two-phase regions in equilibrium diagrams and describes the temperature dependence of miscibility in non-stoichiometric phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid state chemistry"}
