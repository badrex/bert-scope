They discovered energy groups corresponding to specific nuclear levels and observed that inelastic scattering is predominantly a process involving the formation of a compound nucleus. This research provides valuable information about nuclear energy levels and helps to understand the scattering process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
