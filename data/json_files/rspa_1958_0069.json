They found that at high supersaturations, the growth and evaporation curves are straight lines, while at lower supersaturations, both lines become curved. The authors discussed the implications of their findings in relation to Frank's theory of crystal growth and the transfer of momentum to the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
