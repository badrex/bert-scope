The authors discuss the techniques used to control oxygen fugacity and iron oxide content in the charges, and the effects of iron loss on the composition of the samples. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the challenges in studying natural basalts and improve experimental control in the field of lunar geology.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
