This innovative solution prevents insects from entering areas where they are not wanted, such as food storage spaces and bedrooms. The Fluon layer can be applied to various surfaces, including wood, paper, and metal, making it a versatile and effective pest control method.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Entomology"}
