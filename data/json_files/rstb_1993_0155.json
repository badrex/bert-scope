They found that plants expressing the coat protein (CP) gene at low levels were resistant to alfalfa mosaic virus (AIMV) infection, while at higher levels, they protected against both AIMV particles and RNAs. The study also showed that plants transformed with mutant AIMV CP genes were resistant to the virus with the same mutation, and plants expressing replicase genes did not result in resistance to infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
