The author explores the effects of the bar's shape, sharpness of ends, and the resulting frequencies of vibration. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of solids and has applications in engineering and technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
