Researchers found that l-NAME, a blocker of nitric oxide synthase, impairs touch learning in octopuses without affecting sensory or motor functions. This suggests that nitric oxide synthase plays a role in the central structures involved in touch learning.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
