The researchers found that alcohol and brandy in moderate amounts had little to no effect on body temperature and caused a slight increase in pulse rate. The study suggests that alcohol's impact on temperature regulation may be less noticeable in healthy individuals with a consistent diet.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
