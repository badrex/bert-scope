It also explores the relationship between the hemisphere side of the lesion and memory of non-verbal visual material. The study highlights the importance of discrete cortical areas in engram storage and the impact of focalized brain lesions on memory functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuropsychology"}
