They investigated a hypothetical structure containing twelve atoms in general positions and found that the maximum error in a complex structure should not exceed 0.03 \u00c5, with a probable error of about 0.015 \u00c5 for atom separations of between 1.0 and 1.4 \u00c5. The study also showed that errors due to incomplete Fourier series and systematic errors in F values can affect the accuracy of bond-length estimations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
