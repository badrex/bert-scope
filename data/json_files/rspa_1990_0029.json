The author presents three well-posed boundary value problems and constructs self-adjoint differential operators to represent each problem. The paper also explores the effects of interior singularities and the change in sign of the leading coefficient on the distribution of eigenvalues.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
