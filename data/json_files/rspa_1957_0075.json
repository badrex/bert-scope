This phenomenon is explained by a stress-strain relation in which the strain is defined in Hencky's logarithmic measure, confirming that air is an elasticoviscous material with an elastic shear modulus and a finite time of relaxation. A rheological equation for air is proposed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
