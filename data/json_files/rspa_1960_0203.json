They found that the ionic current through the oxide depends on the field strength and temperature, and the capacity of the films formed is almost independent of the acid concentration. The results provide insights into the ionic conductivity of oxides and the growth of anodic oxide films on valve metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
