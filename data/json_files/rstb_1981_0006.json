They discovered two groups of scolopidia, with different orientations and possible different intensity characteristics. The fine structure of the scolopidia and their connections to the cuticle are described in detail, providing a comprehensive understanding of the cicada's auditory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
