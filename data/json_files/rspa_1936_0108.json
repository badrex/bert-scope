The simplified specification of the International Astronomical Union is found to be unsatisfactory, and a new Osram cadmium lamp is suggested as a reliable substitute for the Michelson lamp. The author also confirms that a small pressure of air in the tube is advantageous for accurate reproducibility of the primary standard.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
