This singularity is a null surface that acts like an event horizon. The study of this phenomenon reveals time-like curvature singularities along two-dimensional hyperbolic arcs, similar to the ring singularity of the Kerr metric. This research provides a deeper understanding of the interaction of gravitational waves and black holes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Waves"}
