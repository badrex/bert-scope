These theorems are particularly useful for deriving the logarithms of large fractions from smaller ones or vice versa. Hellins demonstrates their effectiveness through various examples and discusses their potential applications in different areas of mathematics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Logarithms"}
