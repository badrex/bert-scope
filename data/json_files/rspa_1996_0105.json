They find that flows with waves do not meet the plate tangentially, and the shape of the free surface is computed using a boundary integral equation method. The exact form of the wave in the far field is derived from the principle of conservation of momentum, and numerical results are consistent with the exact results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
