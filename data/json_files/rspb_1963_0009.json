They found that the tricarboxylic acid cycle operates in a conventional form in these leaves and identified three main pathways for the incorporation of the carbon skeleton of infiltrated pyruvate into cellular constituents. The results support the concept that most of the malate synthesized when CO2 is fixed during dark acidification is transferred to a storage pool.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
