Gronovius, presents a method for preparing fish specimens by drying their skins. The process involves carefully cutting the fish, removing its intestines, and drying it under the sun or near the fire. The resulting preserved fish specimens can be flattened between papers and used for various purposes in natural history and zoology studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
