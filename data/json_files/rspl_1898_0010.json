The author argues that the enamel in Elasmobranch fishes is a joint product of the epiblastic enamel organ and the mesoblastic dentine papilla, and that it has unique characteristics that set it apart from mammalian enamel. The study provides insights into the evolution of enamel and its development in different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
