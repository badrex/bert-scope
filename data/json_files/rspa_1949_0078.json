The stabilizer, along with other improvements in equipment and navigation systems, enabled the authors to conduct more efficient surveys and gather valuable data for understanding the Earth's gravity field and its geological implications.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
