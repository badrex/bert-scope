They found contractile vacuoles in both amoebocytes and choanocytes of freshwater sponges, but not in cells of some marine sponges. The study provides important observations for understanding the relationships of Porifera to Protozoa and Metazoa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
