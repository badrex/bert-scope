They developed a new method for determining the velocities of all types of military projectiles and designed an accurate eprouvette for gunpowder. The experiments led to the discovery of a more efficient vent design and improved methods for measuring velocities and recoil.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ballistics"}
