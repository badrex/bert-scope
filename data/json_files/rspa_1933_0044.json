They used various methods to analyze the data and found that the end-point of the uranium X's normal-ray spectrum was 3 million volts. They also searched for rays with energies between 3 to 7 million volts but found none, setting an upper limit on their number.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
