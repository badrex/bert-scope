They discovered that the alloys' freezing points form a curve with two branches, and that the gold-copper series does not have a eutectic alloy as previously believed. The authors also found that the alloys' tensile strength and extensibility vary, with the eutectic alloy being more brittle than other members of the series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
