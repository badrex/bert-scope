He discovered that the fibers were not annular as previously believed, but rather spiral in shape. This new understanding of the intestinal fibers' structure led to a better explanation of the peristaltic motion, which is essential for digestion. The author's findings challenged the widely accepted theory of the time and provided a more accurate understanding of the digestive system's mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
