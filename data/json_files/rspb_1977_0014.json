They transplanted fat tissue from lean and obese mice into lean and obese recipients, finding that the internal environment plays a significant role in determining obesity. The fat cells of obese donor fat increased in size when transplanted into an \"obese environment,\" while those of lean donor fat decreased in size in a \"lean environment.\" This study suggests that the environment has a more significant impact on obesity than inherent properties of adipose tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Developmental Biology"}
