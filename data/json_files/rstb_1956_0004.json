The mollusca fauna is described as nondescript and not providing clear indications of climate. The mammalian remains are few in number and variety, making it difficult to draw generalizations about their significance. The study highlights the importance of considering local factors and the potential for unusual faunas in isolated locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
