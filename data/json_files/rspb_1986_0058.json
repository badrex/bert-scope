The model describes the frequency distribution of chain lengths in most of the 62 webs previously used to develop and test the model, as well as 51 new webs. The species-link scaling law, a central feature of the cascade model, is not contradicted by the new data.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
