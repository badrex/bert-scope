They used a bar-magnet and a divided scale to measure the changes in the magnet's position, finding that the observations showed periodical variations in the magnetic force. The study provides essential data for understanding the Earth's magnetic field and its connection to solar activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
