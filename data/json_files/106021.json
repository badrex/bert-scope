The author, David Macbride, shares his experience and observations of the snails' reviviscence, as well as the correspondence with Mr. Stuckey Simon, who first discovered this phenomenon. The authors provide evidence and describe the process of the snails coming back to life after being in a dormant state for a long time. This discovery could encourage further research into the vitality of lower animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
