They observe changes in the structure and behavior of cells, such as the spindle cells, stellate cells, and flat cells, during inflammation. The study provides insights into the cellular and histological changes that occur during corneal inflammation and the role of different cell types in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Histology"}
