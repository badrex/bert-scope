They used minisatellite DNA fingerprinting to detect polymorphic loci in cloned lines of S. ratti and found that the progeny of crosses between genetically distinct clones possess minisatellite characteristics of both male and female parents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
