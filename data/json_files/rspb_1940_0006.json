They find that swelling techniques can produce distorted results and should not be used to study the intact plant cell wall. The study focuses on the hemp fiber, which occurs only in phloem tissue and is either primary or secondary depending on its development from procambium or cambium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
