The research includes hydrogen or carbon oxide-air explosions at a wide range of initial pressures, providing new insights into the effects of density and temperature on gaseous media and the dissociation of steam and carbon dioxide. The findings reveal that at higher pressures, the revised estimates for maximum temperatures are lower than previous estimates, due to co-volume corrections. The study also suggests that the remaining unexplained increase in pressure ratios is likely due to an increase in the opacity of the medium with pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
