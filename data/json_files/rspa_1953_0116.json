They found that the reactions were isotropic and their total cross-sections could be expressed by the Gamow theory of penetration of the Coulomb barrier. However, the simple theory assuming the same energy-independent nuclear parameters for the mirror nuclei could not account for the observed cross-sections of these two reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
