The TFTR tokamak has reached its original machine-design specifications and has extended its operating regime in both ohmic and neutral-beam-heated discharges. The focus is on the wide operating range of TFTR, which has facilitated transport and scaling studies, and the results of these confinement studies are presented.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
