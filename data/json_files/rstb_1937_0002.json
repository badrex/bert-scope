They provide a detailed description of the various elements of the nervous system, including sensory cells, supporting cells, bipolar and multipolar ganglion cells, and the motor functions of Lange's nerve and the apical nerve. The study aims to confirm and expand upon the generally accepted view of the distribution and function of the nervous system in starfish, as described by Cuenot.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
