The authors develop a model that explains the adaptation process, the role of calcium in controlling relay adaptation, and the relation between calcium influx and other oscillating components. The model predicts experimental observations and reproduces essential features of the experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
