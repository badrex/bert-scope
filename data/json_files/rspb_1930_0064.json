The researchers compared the rate of heat production with the rate of muscle stiffening and plasma gelation. They found that the heat production is not due to a simple chemical reaction, but rather a complex process involving multiple changes within the muscle fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
