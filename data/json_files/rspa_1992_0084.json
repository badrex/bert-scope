They investigate the FitzHugh-Nagumo model of excitable media and discover that by modifying the equations, they can obtain rotating vortices with linear cores. This research provides evidence for the existence of linear and elliptical cores in cardiac muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
