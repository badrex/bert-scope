They used strains with different genetic markers to detect galactose permease activity and found that the galP gene lies between the genetic markers for fructose 1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (fda) and 3-phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (serA) at about minute 62 on the E. coli linkage map.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
