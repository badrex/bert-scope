The authors used a modified Lo Surdo source and a Hilger E2 spectrograph to examine the spectrum in the range of 2200-3000 \u00c5. They observed complete Stark patterns for many individual lines and measured the displacements of the diffuse series groups. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of atoms in electric fields and the application of quantum mechanics in understanding atomic spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
