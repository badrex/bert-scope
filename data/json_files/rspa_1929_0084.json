The new system has only one progression, similar to the third positive carbon bands and other higher electronic levels of molecules. The study provides molecular constants of the electronic levels and contributes to the understanding of the behavior and properties of carbon monoxide molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
