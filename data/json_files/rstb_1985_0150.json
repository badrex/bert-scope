The fossils, including fish, salamanders, frogs, turtles, lizards, snakes, crocodiles, birds, and mammals, are well-preserved with articulated skeletons and even the outlines of their entire bodies. This provides valuable information for understanding the appearance, behavior, and diet of these extinct animals. The factors contributing to this exceptional preservation are also examined, including the lake's depth, tropical climate, and integration into a river system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
