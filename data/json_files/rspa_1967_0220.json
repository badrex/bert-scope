The model is an incompressible rigid/plastic continuum that is transversely isotropic, with the preferred direction being the fiber direction. The authors develop the kinematics and general three-dimensional theory for the material and apply it to cases of plane strain and plane stress. The theory is used to analyze previously published experimental data on the yielding of thin fiber-reinforced sheets, showing good agreement between the theoretical predictions and experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
