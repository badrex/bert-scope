The authors found that the explosion ranges of these mixtures generally widen with increasing pressure. However, in some cases, a moderate pressure increase may narrow the explosion ranges. The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of combustible gas mixtures under different pressure conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
