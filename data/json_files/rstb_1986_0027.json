In open conditions, the tree exhibits prolific flowering and branching, while in shaded conditions, the growth remains monopodial for a longer time, and flowering is sparse. The tree's growth pattern transitions from Rauh's architectural model to a partly or entirely modular stage depending on the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
