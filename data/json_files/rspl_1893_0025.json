The author also explores the potential of a ring of elliptic cross-section and the motion of multiple vortex rings on the same axis. The findings have implications for understanding Saturn's rings and the behavior of fluids in various contexts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
