The results show that thyroxine injections increase serum phosphatase levels and affect milk production, with the response being more significant in cows with initially lower serum phosphatase levels. The research also explores the relationship between thyroid hormones and milk secretion, providing insights into the mechanisms of lactation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
