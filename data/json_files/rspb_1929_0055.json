They found that X-radiation caused changes in the cytoplasmic inclusions and mitochondria of the sperm cells. The study also observed that X-radiation affected the growth and development of the moths, with some larvae pupating sooner than usual and others experiencing delayed development or death. The authors suggest that further research is needed to understand the effects of radiation on mitosis and the formation of germ cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Entomology"}
