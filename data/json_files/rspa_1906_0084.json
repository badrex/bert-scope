The study aims to understand the changes occurring in the radioactive minerals and identify their products. The author also discusses the methods employed in the chemical analysis of Thorianite and the experiments conducted to determine the radioactivity of its separated fractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radioactivity"}
