The authors found that two processes help to mitigate the loss of genetic variation: selection and changes in the reproductive success of males. These findings challenge the conventional wisdom of population genetics theory, which predicts that fluctuations in population size and mating success should lead to loss of genetic variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
