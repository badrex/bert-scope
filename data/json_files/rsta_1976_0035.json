The authors explore the temperature-sensitive satellite lines of helium-like resonance lines and the non-flare solar spectra, providing insights into the ionization balance and recombination of the plasma. They also describe a collaborative experiment between the Leicester University group and the American Science and Engineering Group, using Skylab data to construct thermal models of the emitting regions and estimate the abundance of elements in the solar atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
