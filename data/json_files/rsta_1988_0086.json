The study reveals the geological history of the area, including the Main Karakoram Thrust, the Karakoram metamorphic complex, the Karakoram batholith, and the northern Karakoram sedimentary terrane. The research also discusses the magmatic history and the implications of geochemical and isotopic data in understanding the development of the Karakoram region.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
