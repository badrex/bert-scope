The study evaluates the buckling behavior at low tension by retaining nonlinear curvature terms and using an expansion in series to reduce the governing equation to a set of linear ordinary differential equations, which are then solved sequentially by employing Galerkin's technique. This approach is also extended to lateral oscillation of the structure when excited by forced horizontal oscillatory motions at the top end.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Offshore Engineering"}
