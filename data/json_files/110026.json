He found that titanium is harder than pyrites and can scratch glass. It is resistant to various acids and can be dissolved using a combination of nitre and borax. Titanium conducts electricity and does not unite with common metals like tin, lead, silver, or copper. The author suggests that titanium crystals form through a reduction of oxide dissolved in the surrounding slag.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
