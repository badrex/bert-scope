The authors describe the mechanisms of signal relaying, chemotaxis, and the role of cyclic-AMP in cell aggregation and development. They also explore the similarities between cellular communication in Dictyostelium and synaptic transmission in higher organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
