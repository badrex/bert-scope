They used radio waves to explore upper-atmospheric electrification and studied the ionosphere. The research was conducted in collaboration with the Union Radio Scientifique Internationale and involved stations in Tromso, Norway, and Simavik, Canada. The findings contributed to the understanding of the Earth's atmosphere and weather patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
