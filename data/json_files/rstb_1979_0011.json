The research station was built to support long-term scientific research on the island, which is home to around 150,000 giant tortoises living in undisturbed conditions. The research conducted at the station has provided valuable insights into the complex linkages between the island's ecosystem components and their relationships with various environmental factors. The article highlights the importance of conservation efforts to maintain Aldabra as a resource for scientific research."}
