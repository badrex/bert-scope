They found that balanced polymorphisms create a strong signal of increased polymorphism in selfing populations, while reducing genetic variability in the overall population. This implies that the effects of balancing selection are highly localized in inbreeding populations, making it easier to detect signals of balancing selection in highly selfing organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
