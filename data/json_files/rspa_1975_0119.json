The authors develop a simple relation between the flow regime required to observe optical absorption and the ratio of absorption to gas collisional cross sections. They propose a furnace design that optimizes optical absorption depth with respect to mass loss rate over a wide range of pressures, providing order-of-magnitude improvements over simple orifice impedances.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
