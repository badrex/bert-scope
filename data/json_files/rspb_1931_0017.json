They discovered the central excitatory state (CES) and its persistence, which allows for the summation of CES produced by individual centripetal impulses. They also studied the refractory period following a reflex discharge and the effects of antidromic volleys on CES and motoneurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
