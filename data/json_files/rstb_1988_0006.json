It highlights the two main approaches to biological control: classical, which involves introducing exotic pathogens, and mycoherbicides, which use artificially high levels of fungal pathogens. The article emphasizes the importance of safety and effectiveness in selecting and using pathogens for weed control and explores the challenges and opportunities in this field.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
