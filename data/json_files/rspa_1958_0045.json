Blundell and G. Skirrow over a temperature range of 289 to 395\u00b0C. They found that the reaction resembled the oxidation of propylene, with excess olefin showing an inhibiting effect. The authors discussed reaction processes and suggested that a peroxide precedes the formation of acetaldehyde, with branching occurring through the reaction of acetyl radicals produced from acetaldehyde.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
