Researchers used 13C nuclear magnetic resonance (nmr) spectroscopy to demonstrate that water retention plays a significant role in the viscid coating of capture threads, and the extra elasticity of capture threads results from water-induced mobility at a molecular level. The study also found that the organization and composition of structural and capture threads are different, even in the absence of coating, and that glycoproteins may have a more important presence and structural role than previously realized.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
