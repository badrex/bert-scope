The system performs three operations: pre-processing, spatial reasoning, and presenting a congruency evaluation map. The authors tested the system on a forested area in British Columbia, integrating Landsat multispectral scanner data with a provincial forest-cover map, demonstrating its potential for updating geographic information systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Remote Sensing and GIS"}
