The authors examine the composition and botanical characteristics of these nodules, focusing on the presence of Trigonocarpon, a type of fossil plant. The study highlights the potential importance of these nodules in understanding the conversion of plants into bituminous coal and the relationship between various plant genera.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
