They found that both types of cells migrate to the anode, but at different rates, suggesting that the negative charge per unit area on the red corpuscle is greater than that on the yeast cell. The authors also discussed the impact of surface electrification on the cell's functions and the challenges in studying living cells in their natural habitat.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
