The fermentation process differs from that of B. coli communis, with a smaller amount of acetic acid and a larger volume of gas containing more carbon dioxide. The authors also found that both acetylmethylcarbinol and a glycol are produced in smaller quantities when fermenting mannitol. Further research is needed to understand the mode of production of these substances from glucose and mannitol molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
