He suggests that these shells and stones were formed through a flood that carried various marine life and materials to different locations, where they were eventually fossilized. The author provides evidence from various sources, including the jawbones of fish and the shells found in Malta, to support his claims.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
