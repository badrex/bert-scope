They discovered that the major features of carbon metabolism in young seedlings involve hydrolysis of starch, formation of new dry matter, and respiration of carbohydrates. The study found that the rate of translocation of carbohydrates from endosperm to embryo plays a crucial role in the growth and development of the seedlings. The authors also observed differences in respiratory behavior between two samples of barley, but both ultimately reached the same upper limit of respiration rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
