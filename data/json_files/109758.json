The main focus is on the measurement of the sun's position and the determination of the arc without the need for a plumb-line or level. The author also discusses the uncertainty of astronomical refraction and the use of Dr. Bradley's observations as a reference.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Observations"}
