They develop a method to determine these points using the equations of the curve and the tangent, and apply this method to various types of curves, including quartic and cubic curves. The author's work contributes to the understanding of the geometric and analytical properties of plane curves and their tangents.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
