The authors study the reactions of carbon monoxide with iron nitrides and ammonia with iron carbides, leading to the formation of iron-carbon-nitrogen alloys with up to 26 atomic carbon. The study also provides a ternary diagram of the iron-carbon-nitrogen system, showing probable phase fields at various temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Chemistry"}
