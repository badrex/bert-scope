They found that choline levels were elevated in these patients, indicating that nerve degeneration is associated with the breakdown of lecithin. The authors also studied the effects of choline on blood pressure and observed that it caused a temporary fall, which could be blocked by atropine. This research sheds light on the chemical processes underlying nerve degeneration and the potential role of choline in treating neurological diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
