They investigate the effect of uniform and geometric sampling on the singular values and singular functions, showing that geometric sampling provides better approximations with fewer data points. The study has implications for recovering exponential relaxation rates from experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Inverse Problems"}
