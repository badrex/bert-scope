He also recognizes Professor John Desmond Bernal for his work in X-ray crystallography, which helped elucidate the structure of complex organic molecules and proteins. Lastly, Dr. Edward James Salisbury is acknowledged for his significant contributions to plant ecology, broadening the study of British plant communities and relating horticultural practices to known physiological and ecological facts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry", "sub_discipline": "Immunology"}
