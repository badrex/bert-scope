They find that the screening effect is less for higher frequencies and that alternating electric currents distribute themselves similarly to static electrification in corresponding electrostatic arrangements. The author also discusses the screening effect of a rotating conducting sheet and its impact on magnetic action.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
