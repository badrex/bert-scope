They discovered that absinthe causes descending degenerations in the brain and spinal cord, affecting nerve pathways and leading to fits in absinthe epilepsy. The study also found that different types of brain and spinal cord lesions result in varying symptoms and responses to absinthe.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
