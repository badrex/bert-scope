They found that the orientation of the benzene rings in the films depends on the balance between the attraction between the rings and the attraction to the water surface. The films' properties, such as solidity and area per molecule, are influenced by the constitution of the benzene heads and the length of the hydrocarbon chains. The authors also discovered that the films' orientation can change with temperature and compression.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
