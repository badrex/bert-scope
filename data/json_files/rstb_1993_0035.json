It highlights how molecular chaperones are prominent antigens and how they may contribute to protective immunity or have pathological autoimmune consequences. The article also explores the possibility of molecular chaperones playing a functional role in antigen processing and presentation during class II-restricted T lymphocyte responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
