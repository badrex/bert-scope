He discusses various scenarios and their effects on the apparent motion of stars, concluding that the observed changes cannot be solely attributed to parallax or the motion of the solar system. This study contributes to the understanding of the behavior of double stars and their relative positions.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
