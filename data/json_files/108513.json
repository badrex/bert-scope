The author observes that the frequency and force of respiratory movements decrease after decapitation, and that irregularities in breathing patterns remain consistent even after the head is removed. These findings suggest a correspondence between the supra-oesophageal and sub-oesophageal ganglia of insects and the brain and medulla oblongata of vertebrates, as well as a possible multiplication and diffusion of nervous centers for respiration in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
