He observed the lunar-diurnal variations of the inclination and total force using a magnetometer over a five-year period. The results confirmed the moon's magnetic influence on Earth and showed that the lunar-diurnal variation is consistent with the hypothesis that the moon's magnetism is derived by induction from the Earth's magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
