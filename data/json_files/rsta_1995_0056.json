The author explains the mechanics and mechanisms of high-temperature design, including the use of reference stress, deformation bounds, and continuum damage mechanics. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms to create efficient test programs and extrapolation techniques for high-temperature materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
