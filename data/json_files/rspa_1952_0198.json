They used a surface-tube technique and found that the surface tube is a reliable method for measuring skin friction even in supersonic conditions. The results also show that disturbances due to a shock wave only propagate upstream a few multiples of the boundary layer thicknesses, even when strong enough to cause local separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
