The method involves using a revolving plate with photographic paper and fine wires to mark the scales of the instruments. The paper also discusses improvements to the lighting system and a new method for determining the scale and temperature coefficients of force magnetometers, which provides greater accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism and Electromagnetism"}
