It compares the regulation of intracellular chloride levels in frog skeletal muscle and sheep cardiac Purkinje fibers using ion-selective microelectrodes. The study finds that chloride distribution in cardiac muscle is non-passive, and much of the net movement across the cardiac membrane appears to be carrier-mediated. The exchange of bicarbonate ions plays a role in controlling intracellular chloride levels in heart tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
