The study finds that boundary modulations can enhance heat transport by convection in certain ranges of parameters. The preferred pattern of convection is determined by a stability analysis, and the results show that the effects of boundary modulations on one side alone can be misleading, as unexpected linear combinations of modulation modes on both boundaries can influence the preferred flow pattern.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
