The author presents a theoretical approach to calculate the additional resistance due to free surface waves and applies it to a model ship. The results show that the resistance can be reduced by up to 30% depending on the ship's position relative to the waves. The study also considers the case of a ship advancing through transverse waves moving with the appropriate velocity for their wavelength.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
