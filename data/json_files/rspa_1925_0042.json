They suggest that the extra lines in the triplets can be considered as extending the triplets into quadruplets, and the triplet series resemble one another closely, except for a difference in scale. The authors also examine the possibility of attributing the close together lines to successive vibrational states of the nuclei within the molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
