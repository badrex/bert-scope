The author presents a novel and simple derivation of tension field theory, which is based on a principle of maximum strain energy. The study has implications for the design of lightweight stretched membrane structures, such as protective coverings, air-cushion devices, and portable inflatable bridges.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
