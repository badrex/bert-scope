They find that a circular pipe carries more liquid when filled up to nineteen-twentieths of its diameter than when completely full, which they call a \"hydraulic paradox.\" This result can be utilized in circular drain-pipes that may be coated with sediments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
