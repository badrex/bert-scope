The model uses a reaction-diffusion equation and takes into account factors such as local density growth, population spread, and the negative impact of high-density inner cores on settlement. The authors discuss the steady-state solutions and the potential for future applications in city planning and understanding urban dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Urban Studies and Planning"}
