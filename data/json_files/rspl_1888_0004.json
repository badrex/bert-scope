They explore the resistance due to friction and the concept of hydraulic mean depth, which is defined as the quotient of the area of the cross-section of the liquid and the perimeter in contact with the pipe or channel. They also analyze the behavior of the rotating pile and its action, which is different from that described in Noad's 'Electricity and Magnetism.'", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus of Variations", "sub_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics > Hydraulic Mean Depth"}
