They use an alternative formulation to simplify the understanding of the physical processes involved and avoid numerical inversion of Laplace transforms. This method allows for a wide range of loadings to be considered and can be applied to fracture problems in porous rocks and fluid-filled materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
