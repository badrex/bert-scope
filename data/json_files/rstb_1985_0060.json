Researchers found that only stimulation in the dorsal hippocampus and pretectal area caused antinociception without significant aversion. Antinociception was significantly correlated with the aversiveness of the stimulation, but strong aversion was seen with no antinociception in 15% of the stimulation sites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
