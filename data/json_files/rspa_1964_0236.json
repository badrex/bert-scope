They examine the stress pulses produced by these impacts and find that liquid and shock impacts generate intense, short-duration pulses, while solid impacts have longer impact times. The authors also investigate the role of stress waves and flaws in the fracture process, using high-speed photography to capture the development of fractures. Their findings have practical implications for supersonic aircraft and erosion in high-velocity systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
