They calculate the non-exponential factors and energy changes related to these equilibria and analyze the vibrational contributions to the equilibrium constants. The study also discusses the dependence of the equilibrium values on the chemical constitution of the participants and the role of vibrational modes in the associations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Equilibria and Thermodynamics"}
