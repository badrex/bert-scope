Liming measures were taken to study whether lime treatment could protect waters valuable for fisheries, nature conservation, or recreational uses. The treatment resulted in successful reproduction and recovery of fish populations in lakes and rivers where the pH was increased. However, liming cannot be a complete solution for acidified waters, and other factors like acid groundwater and toxic metals still pose a threat to fish populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
