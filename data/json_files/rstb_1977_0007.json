The research describes the unique features and feeding mechanisms of each species, highlighting the specialized chelipeds and mouthparts that help them collect and manipulate food particles. The atyid mandibles and fore-gut structures are also analyzed, providing insights into the evolution of these prawns and their adaptation to their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
