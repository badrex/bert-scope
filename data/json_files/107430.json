{"article_id": "107430", "revised_title": "Exploring the Polarizing and Optical Properties of Agate", "semantic_tags": ["Crystallography", "Polarization", "Light refraction", "Agate", "Optical properties"], "tldr": "The author, David Brewster, investigates the unique optical properties of agate, a crystallized stone, and its ability to polarize and refract light. He discovers that the structure of agate produces two distinct images, a bright image and a nebulous one, and that the stone's structure is connected to its optical properties. Brewster also explores the different structures within agate and their effects on light transmission and reflection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
