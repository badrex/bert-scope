The author found that these animals can perceive and respond to specific tones, particularly the bass note of the B flat. The response is associated with a physiological status of the animal itself, and the auditory function is generally located in the first antennae. This research provides insights into the auditory capabilities of aquatic species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
