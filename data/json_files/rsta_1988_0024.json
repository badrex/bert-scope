The system processes satellite images and oceanographic data, allowing users to make meaningful comparisons between the two data sets. It is designed to be flexible and user-friendly, with a menu-driven interface and the ability to handle data from various sources. The system has applications in oceanographic modeling studies and in relating sea-surface temperatures to the three-dimensional water-column structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
