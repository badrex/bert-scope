Ferrall, describes a fibrous tunic called the tunica vaginalis oculi that insulates and protects the eye-ball from the pressure of its muscles while they are in action. This tunic allows the eye's recti muscles to give rotatory motions without causing retraction or injury to the eye. The tunic is perforated by six openings for the tendons of the muscles to emerge and play their course.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
