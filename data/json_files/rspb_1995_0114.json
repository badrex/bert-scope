In a controlled environment, ants were trained to visit a food source while all other orientational cues were eliminated. When the magnetic field was altered, a significant proportion of ants adjusted their orientation accordingly. This discovery shows that wood ants can use magnetic fields for navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
