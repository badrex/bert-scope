The author calculates the work absorbed and evolved by air-engines under various pressures and temperatures, and compares their economical value to steam-engines. The results show that air-engines can be more efficient in certain conditions, but other factors such as heat loss during the evaporation process in steam-engines must also be considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
