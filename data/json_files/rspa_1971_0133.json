The authors describe different optical geometries and evaluate the signal imposed on the photodetector. They demonstrate the relative merits of various arrangements for measuring mean and fluctuating velocity in two directions, providing insights into optimizing optical anemometers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
