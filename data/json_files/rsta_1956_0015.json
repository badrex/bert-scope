They develop a method to derive asymptotic solutions by comparing the equation with a similar one and satisfying it formally using a series with coefficients independent of the parameter. The results can be applied to hypergeometric and confluent hypergeometric equations, and help in determining new asymptotic expansions of Legendre, Laguerre, and Coulomb-wave functions of large orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
