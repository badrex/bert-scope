He found that the leaves play a crucial role in the health of trees, as they help prepare and assimilate sap. Defective leaves can lead to diseases and debilities in old varieties of fruit trees, especially in rich soils or when grafted onto vigorous stocks. The author suggests that a similar process might be responsible for the debilities of old age in animals, possibly due to lung function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
