They found that the crystal structure of acetylenedicarboxylic acid dihydrate expands when deuterium replaces hydrogen, similar to the effect observed in oxalic acid dihydrate. The results suggest that short isotope bonds involve an overlap of two structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
