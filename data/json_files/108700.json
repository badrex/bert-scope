They discovered that the point of maximum motion shifts towards the side of the glacier where the valley turns its convex curvature. This finding helps to explain the differences in glacier motion and crevasse formation patterns observed in various locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
