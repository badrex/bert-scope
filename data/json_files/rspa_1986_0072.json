The research provides evidence about the nature and reactivity of adsorbed intermediates involved in the catalytic reactions, revealing that the dominant mechanism of exchange occurs between adsorbed alkene and adsorbed-allyl species. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the mechanisms of exchange and addition reactions on oxide catalysts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
