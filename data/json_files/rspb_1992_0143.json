The researchers found that the expression of acetylcholine receptors at neuromuscular synapses in skeletal muscle is regulated by innervation, and that the prion protein does not play a significant role in this process. This suggests that neural regulation of acetylcholine receptor expression in skeletal muscle can be mediated by factors not derived from the prion gene.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
