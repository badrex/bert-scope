They found that the angle of complete polarization for Iceland spar depends on the position of the reflecting surface relative to the crystal's axis and the position of its principal section to the plane of reflection. This research expanded upon previous work by Sir David Brewster and Dr. Seebeck, and provided further understanding of the relationship between light polarization and crystal optics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
