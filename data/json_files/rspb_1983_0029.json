They found that both drugs cause a transient block of the channels, with gallamine being more effective. This blockage affects the time course and amplitude of the synaptic currents, providing insights into the action of cholinergic antagonists on neurotransmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
