They developed a theoretical framework and used a plane collector electrode screened by a fine wire grid to separate positive ions and electrons. The study aimed to understand the positive-ion current to a plane probe as a function of the applied voltage, enabling the formulation of a consistent theory of probe action at potentials negative to the space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
