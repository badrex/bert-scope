They found that food, whether vegetable or animal, increases the amount of uric acid in urine, and there is no significant difference between the two types of food. Exercise does not have a marked effect on the amount of sulphates in urine. The author also discovered that certain medications, such as sulphuric acid, sulphate of soda, and sulphate of magnesia, can increase the sulphates in urine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
