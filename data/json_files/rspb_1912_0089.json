They found that feeding flies on blood containing arsenic affected the flagellates in the fly's gut but did not harm the flagellates in the salivary glands. This supports the theory that salivary gland flagellates are the true infecting form of the parasite. The author also discovered that arsenic-containing blood did not prevent the development of flagellates in the fly or create an arsenic-resistant strain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
