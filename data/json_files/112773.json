They discovered that prominences can be divided into two classes: those with intense action and those that are tranquil. The author also found that bright prominences are associated with spots, while dull prominences are not. Additionally, the author observed that bright lozenge-shaped appearances in the solar spectrum indicate a decrease in pressure and are related to solar eruptions and prominences.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
