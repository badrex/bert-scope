The research finds high heritabilities for various morphological traits, suggesting a strong potential for evolutionary change in the population. The findings also indicate that the population may have been subject to disruptive selection followed by stabilizing selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
