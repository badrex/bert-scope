He observed that all lakes receive rivers and have no outlet, causing their waters to evaporate and become saltier over time. Halley suggested that a similar process occurs in the ocean, leading to an increase in salinity. By measuring the current salinity of lakes and the ocean, and comparing it to historical records, Halley believed that the age of the Earth could be estimated.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
