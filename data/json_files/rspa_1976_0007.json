The author discusses the implications of an elasticity of layered media and the different modes of deformation, focusing on the inextensional state of a strongly deformed lamella. The article also considers the energy of the states of inextension, stretching, and tilting of the molecules, and the equations of equilibrium in the inextended state."}
