It shows that a uniform surface current does not disturb the flow around a spherical cap cavity, making it difficult to detect using electrical potential on the plane surface. In contrast, a circular arc crack produces noticeable changes in the surface field, making it easier to detect. Experiments confirm the theoretical predictions for both cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
