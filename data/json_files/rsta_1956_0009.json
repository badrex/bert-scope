It discusses the behavior of these alloys and how impurities can influence the transition temperature and critical field. The study provides evidence for the existence of a range of coherence in the superconducting phase and supports Pippard's phenomenological theory of superconductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
