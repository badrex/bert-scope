They found that these humours are composed of water, albumen, gelatine, and a muriate, with the basis of the aqueous humour being soda. The author also observed differences in specific gravity and chemical composition between the humours of different animals, suggesting a possible relationship with eye size and vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
