The authors suggest that the condition is a result of Mendelian inheritance, with dominant factors for black coat color and short-legged conformation. They also propose that the Dexter breed may have originated from the mating of Black Kerry and Red Devon cattle. The article highlights the challenges in breeding Dexters due to the increased proportion of stillborn or deformed calves resulting from Dexter x Dexter matings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
