This new arrangement overcomes previous difficulties and introduces a new type of series, with five singlet series recorded, including principal, diffuse, sharp, and two combination series. The quadruplet series' complex structure and the presence of a fundamental series of quadruplets support the proposed arrangement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
