Hofmann, discovered new poly-ammonias through reactions involving ethylate of sodium and cyanate of ethyl. These compounds, such as cyantriethyl-diamine and carbotriethyltriamine, have unique properties and can be transformed into other substances like ethylamine and diethylurea. This research expands our understanding of ammonia derivatives and their transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
