They explore various mathematical solutions for different symmetries and discuss the effects of rotation on the distribution of a nebula. The study provides insights into the forms and behaviors of astronomical phenomena, such as nebulae and their evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
