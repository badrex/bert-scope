They discuss the limitations of the infinitesimal model and propose a revised estimation method that accounts for the effects of selection, dominance, and mutation on the rate of increase in heritability. The study focuses on Drosophila melanogaster bristle number traits and provides insights into the maintenance of genetic variation in natural populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
