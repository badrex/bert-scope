They observe a green glow that intensifies with increased pressure and temperature. The author also explores the similarities between this luminescence and the \"wing effect\" in fluorescence of optically excited mercury, suggesting a connection between the two phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
