W. Lubbock, continues his research in physical astronomy, focusing on lunar inequalities and the effects of the cube of the disturbing force. He provides mathematical developments and expressions for the longitude, considering the parallactic inequality and the stability of the system. The study aims to improve the accuracy of astronomical calculations and better understand the behavior of celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
