The author examines the council's policy of excluding the Central Powers, particularly Germany, and how this decision was met with opposition from scientists and neutrals. The article highlights the efforts of scientists like William Bateson, G. H. Hardy, and Sir David Prain, who opposed the exclusion policy and played a role in changing the council's statutes in 1926, allowing the Central Powers to join.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > History of Science"}
