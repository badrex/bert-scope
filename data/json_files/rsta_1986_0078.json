They employ energy methods, conserved quantities, and convexity estimates to derive nonlinear stability criteria, which differ from linearized Vol. 318 stability criteria. The study covers specific examples and Hamiltonian structures for the problems, providing a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics and stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
