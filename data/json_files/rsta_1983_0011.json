The observed spectra were compared with the Garrett-Munk model, which represents the internal wavefield in the deep ocean. The JASIN observations showed higher spectral levels than the GM model, particularly at high frequencies and wavenumbers. The three-mode model was used to explain these features, and the spatial variation of internal wave variance was related to topography.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
