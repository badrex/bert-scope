The study uses vacuum tubes and discharges to observe the lines and compares them to the spectrum of NII. The findings are in accordance with Hund's theory, and the author proposes a modified system of numeration for the terms of NII that can be more generally applied to other spectra. The study also discusses the terms of O III and O IV, and the author provides a simple Rydberg formula to calculate term values for the spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
