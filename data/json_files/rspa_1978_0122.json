They consider a system of non-interacting electrons in a random potential described by a multivariate Gaussian distribution. The density of states is calculated for a model characteristic of a highly doped semiconductor, showing an exponential behavior at negative energies and a proportional relationship to energy (E) at positive energies. The authors also discuss the localization criterion and the mobility edge in amorphous solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
