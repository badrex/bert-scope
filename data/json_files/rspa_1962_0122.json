The researchers used the Rice-Herzfeld mechanism and measured the rate constant in the first-order region. They derived values for propane, three pentanes, and three octanes, discussing the variations of rate constants with structure. The findings provide insights into the decomposition of paraffins and the role of nitric oxide as an inhibitor.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
