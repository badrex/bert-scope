They discovered that plants can absorb water and nutrients through their roots and stems, and that air plays a crucial role in plant growth. The experiments also showed that different plants respond differently to changes in air pressure and vacuum conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
