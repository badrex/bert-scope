The author demonstrates that the orientation of a stem part does not affect its susceptibility to inhibition, and that the critical factor determining inhibition is the ability of the cambial stimulus to enter the stem. The study also shows that a stem part receiving the cambial stimulus is protected from being killed, even if it is out of the line between growing leaves and roots.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
