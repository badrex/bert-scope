They discuss the limitations of the resonance theory and propose a new model that considers temperature variations with both height and latitude. This model aims to address the discrepancies found in the resonance theory and provide a better understanding of the solar semi-diurnal oscillation and its relation to the lunar oscillation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
