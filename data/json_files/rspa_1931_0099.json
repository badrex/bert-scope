They used wave equations from Darwin and Dirac to calculate the displacements in different electric fields and found that the asymmetry has its origin in the fine structure of the hydrogen atom. The experimental results agree reasonably well with the theoretical predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
