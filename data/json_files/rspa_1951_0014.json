They discovered that the crystals experienced significant rotation and deformation in the surface regions, with some parts rotating by up to 90 degrees. The deformation caused by abrasion is similar to the development of \"deformation bands.\" This research contributes to the understanding of materials science and surface science.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
