The authors describe experiments to investigate energy supply and heart rate in isolated perfused rat hearts, validate the perfusion model, and study ischaemia and metabolism in rabbit kidneys to understand the relation between functional and metabolic recovery after a renal transplant operation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry and Physiology"}
