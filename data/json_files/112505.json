Hofmann, discovered new compounds isomeric with the sulphocyanic ethers by studying the reaction between bisulphide of carbon and ethylamine. These new compounds, which he called mustard oil of the ethyl series, have different properties and reactions compared to the known sulphocyanic ethers. The author also found that these new compounds have a similar parallelism with allyl-body, as mustard oil is in the allyl-series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
