They analyzed the small subunit ribosomal DNA of these bacteria to investigate their phylogeny and found that the endosymbionts of five cockroach species make up a coherent group with no close relatives within the eubacterial phylum defined by the flavobacteria. This finding sheds light on the relationships between the endosymbionts and their host taxonomic relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
