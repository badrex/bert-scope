P. Joule conducted experiments on the thermal effects of elastic fluids, specifically dry atmospheric air, using a large-scale apparatus provided by the Royal Society. They observed a cooling effect as the air passed through a plug of non-conducting porous material, and they investigated the factors influencing this effect, such as the pressure of the air and the gas properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
