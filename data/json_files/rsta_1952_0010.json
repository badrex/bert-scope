They discuss direct and indirect methods, including the Aitken-Bernoulli process and the root-squaring process, and consider the challenges and difficulties that arise when solving polynomials with complex coefficients or zeros that are close together. The study aims to provide practical guidance for computer users working with desk calculating machines or other equipment.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
