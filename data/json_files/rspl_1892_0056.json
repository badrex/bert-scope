They found that the potential difference required to produce a spark decreases to a minimum value and then increases rapidly as the pressure diminishes. This effect was further investigated using a new apparatus, revealing that the curves connecting potential difference and pressure exhibit minima and cross each other, showing that shorter sparks require a greater potential difference at low pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
