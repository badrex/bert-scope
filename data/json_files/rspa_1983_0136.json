The research focuses on the particle-particle pair correlation functions and extracts information about the arrangement of water molecules around the ions. The findings provide insights into the hydration of the nickel ions and the coordination of water molecules in the solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution chemistry"}
