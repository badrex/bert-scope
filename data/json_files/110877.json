He analyzes the force of vapor at different temperatures, the \"moist bulb problem,\" and the constitution of mixed gases. The author also examines the question of whether aqueous vapor exists in the atmosphere as a mechanical mixture or chemical solution. Lastly, he investigates methods for determining heights using barometric observations and provides related tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
