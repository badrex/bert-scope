The authors suggest an integrated acridometeorological watch system, built and operated jointly by meteorological and plant protection services at the national level, and coordinated internationally by the Food and Agriculture Organization. This system would not only be useful for Desert Locust survey and control but also for the sustainable use of the Saharan environment for the benefit of nomads and newly settled peasants.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
