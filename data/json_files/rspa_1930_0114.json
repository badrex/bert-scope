They discovered that the color change in the crystals was due to the separation of a colored cryohydrate film on the surface of each crystal, rather than a change in the crystal structure. The study helps to clarify the understanding of the behavior of hydrated salts when cooled.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
