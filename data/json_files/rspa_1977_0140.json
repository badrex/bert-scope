They find that the levels are correlated and exhibit a repulsion between adjacent levels, depending on the arithmetic nature of the frequency ratios of the oscillators. This theory is supported by numerical experiments on two-dimensional systems involving up to 10,000 levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
