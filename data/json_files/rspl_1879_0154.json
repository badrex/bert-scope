It presents a theorem that enables the expression of certain sums involving algebraic functions as algebraic or logarithmic expressions. The author demonstrates the theorem's application to various cases and provides an example of its process. The article also includes an addition from Professor Cayley, showing the connection between the theorem and the deficiency of a curve represented by an equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra and Calculus"}
