They found that the behavior of these metals deviates from the theoretical predictions, with some having positive thermo-electric powers. The authors also observed changes in thermo-electric power when impurities were added to the metals, providing insights into the influence of impurities on electron scattering processes in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
