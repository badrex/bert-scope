It suggests that current control strategies, such as population reduction, may not be effective and proposes alternative strategies based on the birds' biology and migration patterns. The authors recommend tailoring control efforts to specific damage situations and using a combination of methods, including altering crop phenology, destroying breeding colonies, and implementing biological research for other bird pest species.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Crop Management"}
