V. Thompson, discovered that decapod crustaceans, such as the Cancer Maenas, undergo a double metamorphosis. First, they hatch as Zoea, then transform into Megalopa, and finally become the adult crab. This research provides a deeper understanding of the life cycle and development of crustaceans, which can help in the study of their biology and conservation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
