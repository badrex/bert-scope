He explains how the sensation of different colors depends on the frequency of these vibrations in the retina. Young's theory also accounts for phenomena such as refraction, reflection, and dispersion of colors, providing a more comprehensive understanding of light and its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
