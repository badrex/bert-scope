They discovered that nitrites change the color of blood from red to brown and alter the absorption spectrum of hemoglobin. The study also found that ammonia can revert the color back to red. This research provides insights into the chemical reactions and relations of hemoglobin and its interaction with nitrites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
