They found that Vesta appeared as a star of the 6th magnitude with no visible disc. The observations were made using telescopes with magnifying powers of 150 and 300, and a 15-feet reflector. Vesta's apparent diameter was found to be less than 4-T,8, or about half the apparent diameter of Saturn's fourth satellite. The intensity and unsteadiness of Vesta's light, along with its small size, were considered remarkable for a body in the region between Mars and Jupiter, where other recently discovered planets also orbit the sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
