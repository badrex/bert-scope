The authors develop a theory assuming that errors are proportional to the magnitude of the Fourier coefficients and analyze how the error varies with the position of the atom in relation to its neighbors. The study provides a more accurate method for assessing the probable errors in atomic coordinates, which is essential for understanding molecular structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
