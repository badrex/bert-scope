The author presents theoretical relations between term values corresponding to orbits of given quantum numbers in these atoms, which can be used to compare with experimental results and assist in identifying spectral lines. The study is based on the assumption that the atomic field is a central field, and the theoretical work is developed using formulae derived from Bohr's theory of atomic structure and spectra."}
