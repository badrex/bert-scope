They found that both systems exhibit a minimum in diffusivity as a function of composition, which is characteristic of alcohol-water mixtures. Additionally, a local maximum in diffusivity occurs along an isotherm for alcohol-rich mixtures, a behavior not observed before. The data is compared with other transport and equilibrium properties and a simplified form of the statistical mechanical theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
