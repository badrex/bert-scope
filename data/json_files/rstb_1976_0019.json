The authors use molecular orbital calculations to predict and explain the reactivity of different carbon atoms within these pigments. They also explore how metal-ligand interactions can dramatically change the properties of the pigments, such as their redox potentials and reactivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
