They discovered that the muscular contractions in the frog's limb were not due to electrical influence but rather the irritant action of the urticating organs of the Anemones. This finding debunked the idea that these creatures were electrical.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
