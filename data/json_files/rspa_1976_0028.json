The study focuses on the solar wind and uses the method of matched asymptotic expansions to construct a solution describing the flow field from the Sun's surface to infinity. The results show that the flow can either remain supersonic and terminate at a finite point or become subsonic through a diffuse shock layer, approaching a non-zero pressure at infinity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
