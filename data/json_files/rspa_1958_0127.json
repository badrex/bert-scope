They demonstrate that a large number of explosion primers can be caused to detonate by brief irradiation with sparks from energetic electric discharges. The initiation is mainly due to the sudden heating of the compounds, resulting in a photothermic effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Explosives"}
