It examines the biophysical aspects and discusses the factors that may limit the viability of animals during chilling, freezing, and thawing. The research explores the proportion of body water converted to ice and its impact on the survival of hamsters. The findings contribute to understanding the possibility of storing whole animals for long periods in suspended animation in the frozen state.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
