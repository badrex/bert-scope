They discussed the imperfections of the common azimuth compass and proposed a new design for a more accurate compass. The author also observed that the strength of the compass needle's virtue was not always consistent, and they suggested that others make similar observations to determine the cause.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
