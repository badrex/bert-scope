They conducted experiments to test the hypothesis of centromere affinity, which suggests that paternal and maternal centromeres tend to segregate to opposite poles at the first meiotic division. The results support the existence of a new phenomenon involving non-random segregation of unlinked markers, called affinity, and provide evidence for the role of centromeres in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
