They use a Chebyshev series method to accurately represent the pressure spike and film thickness, providing a smooth connection between different areas of parameter space. This method can be applied to a wide range of contacts, from heavily loaded to more lightly loaded ones.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
