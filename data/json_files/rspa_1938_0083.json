The authors discovered that spark discharges consist of two or more components, similar to a lightning flash. They studied the leader and main strokes of the spark discharge and found that the main stroke has a higher propagation velocity than the leader stroke. The authors also observed differences in discharge behavior when changing the polarity of the high-voltage electrode.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
