He found that the interval of disappearance of light was constant and that the distribution of colors in both interference and dispersion phenomena was similar, suggesting a common cause. Young's findings supported Newton's work on thin plates and provided a deeper understanding of the behavior of light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
