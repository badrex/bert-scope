The analysis focuses on the occurrence of Coles' wavy vortices when no Taylor vortex flow is present, with a small eccentricity and a very small clearance ratio. The results are compared with experimental findings, showing a qualitative similarity but differing in magnitude due to the absence of nonlinear effects. The study extends previous research on concentric rotating cylinders and provides insights into the behavior of wavy vortices in eccentric systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
