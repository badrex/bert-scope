They develop a system of metrics and first-order equations that incorporate both the wave equation of quantum theory and the null geodesics of the theory of relativity. This approach suggests a periodicity and discontinuity in the fifth coordinate, leading to principles of minimum proper time and indeterminateness. The authors believe this unification may lead to a better understanding of fundamental constants and the nature of the quantum problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
