The authors emphasize the need for more taxonomists, increased collaboration between various scientific disciplines, and the importance of understanding the effects of human interference on the environment. They also highlight the vulnerability of native species to rapid replacement by northern species and the need to conserve southern continental areas and islands for the study of their native flora and fauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
