The analysis concludes that such accidents are highly improbable, and the plant has been designed to reduce their frequency to around 10^-6 per year. The containment building would only fail in a small proportion of degraded-core accidents, and the release of radioactivity to the environment would be minimal. The individual risk of accidental death near the reactor would only increase by 1 in 100,000, and the risk of death due to cancer would also see a small increase. The article emphasizes the large margin of safety between the risks estimated for Sizewell B and those already present in society.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
