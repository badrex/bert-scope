He discovers that these stars are not just clusters of distant stars but are actually connected systems. He also discusses the difficulty in explaining the condensation of stars in the center of these systems and the connection between the outer parts and the condensed inner parts. Herschel's observations and findings contribute to a better understanding of the structure and composition of celestial objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Objects"}
