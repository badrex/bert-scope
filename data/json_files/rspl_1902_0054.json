The first method involves a closed-box apparatus that mixes air with chloroform vapour, while the second method uses a portable apparatus that limits the surface area for evaporation. Both methods allow for precise control of chloroform concentration in the inhaled air, ensuring patient safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Anaesthesia"}
