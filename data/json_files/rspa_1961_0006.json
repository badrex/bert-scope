The study assumes uniform fields and a steady state for all charged and neutral species. The analysis is based on the Lorentz approximation and considers electron-atom collisions. The mean electron energy and drift velocity are discussed for two cases: constant mean free path and constant collision time. The Hall conductivity is expressed in a general form, and an additional current component is observed, which vanishes when the magnetic field is parallel or perpendicular to the electric field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
