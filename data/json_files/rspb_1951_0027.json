They discovered that the decrease of extensibility due to stimulation begins to appear after a quarter to a third of the latent period has elapsed. This research was conducted on tortoise muscles, which allowed for slower stretches and reduced vibration. The author found that the increased resistance to stretch sets in considerably before any detectable shortening occurs, leading to a better understanding of muscle contraction and its underlying mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
