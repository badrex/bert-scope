It explores the systematic changes in clay mineral assemblages and their reactions with other minerals, organic matter, and pore-water during the burial process. The article highlights the importance of understanding these reactions for predicting the type and amount of clay minerals present in reservoirs and their impact on petroleum formation and extraction efficiency."}
