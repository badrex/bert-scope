They discovered that one type of sap, called the true sap, is generated in the leaves and stored in the alburnum during winter. This stored sap is used to create new leaves in the spring. The author also found that winter-felled wood is superior due to the absence of sap during that season. The experiments conducted by the author provide insights into the movement of sap and the role of leaves in preparing nutrients for tree growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
