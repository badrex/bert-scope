They found that the currents measured by the Board of Trade balance were approximately 1% higher than their values in terms of the Ayrton-Jones balance. This result is satisfactory as it confirms the intended standards for the Board of Trade ampere and the ampere as determined by the Ayrton-Jones balance.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
