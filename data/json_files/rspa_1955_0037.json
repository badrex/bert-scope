They use crystal field theory and quantum mechanics to calculate the Coulomb energies and determine the positions of the energy levels. The study helps in understanding the behavior of europium ions in different crystal fields and provides insights into the structure and properties of europium salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
