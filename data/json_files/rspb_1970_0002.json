The results showed that the two semicircular canals in the lamprey can respond to angular accelerations in all planes, despite the absence of the horizontal canal. The vibration sensitivity of the lamprey labyrinth resembles that found in elasmobranchs, and the responses to angular acceleration were found to be similar to those in the gnathostome labyrinth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
