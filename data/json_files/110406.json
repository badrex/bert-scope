He demonstrates that white refracted light is formed by the superposition of fringes of colors or rays of light that compensate each other. Diffracted white light is also formed by the superposition of fringes that are not uniformly refracted but still maintain mutual compensation. The purity of the light's color in both cases depends on its continuity, and any interruption can produce colors in its further progress.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
