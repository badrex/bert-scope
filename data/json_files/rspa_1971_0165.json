They measured relaxation times and found that both rotational-vibrational and translational-vibrational energy transfer are important. The results show that para-hydrogen is not an order of magnitude less efficient than ortho-hydrogen in deactivating the bending vibration, contrary to previous theoretical calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas Dynamics"}
