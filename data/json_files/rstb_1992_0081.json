The results show that certain adrenoceptor agonists, such as noradrenaline and adrenaline, inhibit these currents, while the cells possess predominantly transient, low-threshold-activated inward calcium currents. This research provides insights into the understanding of excitation-contraction coupling in smooth muscle cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
