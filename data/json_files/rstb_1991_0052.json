It is suggested that testosterone may act as an attractant or a releaser of reproductive behavior in fish. The olfactory sensitivity to testosterone in precocious male parr is lost two weeks before spawning, while the role of testosterone in female Atlantic salmon remains uncertain. Further research is needed to establish the behavioral or physiological role of waterborne testosterone in Atlantic salmon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Behavior"}
