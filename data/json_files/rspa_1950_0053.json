It shows that under certain conditions, the overlap factor is irrelevant in calculating bond orders and charges for most conjugated hydrocarbons, but it can significantly affect heteromolecules. The article also discusses the energy values calculated with and without the inclusion of overlap.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
