The author suggests that an entire galactic stellar cluster undergoes gravitational contraction as a whole, and that this process is driven by the pressure exerted by hot interstellar material surrounding the cloud. The article also explores the fragmentation of this compressed material into individual stars and the implications for cosmic evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
