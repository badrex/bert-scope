They improve the simple semiclassical theory and find that the anticaustic singularities are softened and decorated by oscillations that depend on the number of freedoms. This study is relevant to understanding the behavior of quantum wavefunctions in ergodic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
