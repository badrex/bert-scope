They discuss the foundation of the theory of compound colors laid by Newton and the work of other scientists like Young, Brewster, and Helmholtz. The author presents a diagram to express the results of their experiments on color mixing, showing that a color chromatically identical to white can be formed by combining yellow and indigo. They also discuss the concept of complementary colors and how colors can be represented and combined using mathematical methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
