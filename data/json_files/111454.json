They discovered that these sea creatures can cause muscular contractions in frogs when their tentacles come into contact with the frog's nerves. The author concludes that the Actiniae have electrical power, which can be demonstrated through various experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior and Electrophysiology"}
