This method uses a rod with a heater and two thermometers, allowing for the determination of thermal diffusivity and thermal conductivity. The technique was tested on copper and aluminum specimens in the liquid-helium temperature range, providing accurate results with fewer systematic errors compared to the static method.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
