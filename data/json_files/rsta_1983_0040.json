It highlights the development of a remote sensing methodology at the Macaulay Institute for Soil Research, which has been applied to peat resource mapping, land-cover mapping, and crop monitoring. The article also reviews the current use of remote sensing data by the Peat Survey Section and the Soil Survey Department for peat, soil, and vegetation mapping. The methodology has proven to be cost-effective and efficient in mapping and monitoring various land-cover types and resources in Scotland.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Remote Sensing"}
