They use the tight-binding scheme and extended Huckel method to calculate band structures and estimate the relative stabilities of different polymer configurations. The study covers polymers with carbon skeletons, including polyacetylene, polydiacetylene, polyphenylene, polyacene, and graphite, among others.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
