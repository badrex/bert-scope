The authors found that significant anharmonic vibrations generate the \"forbidden\" reflexions, which are not present in the harmonic version of the structure factor. The study provides a basis for understanding the behavior of these materials under high-temperature conditions and helps in detecting anharmonic phenomena in Bragg scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
