He suggested using circumpolar stars and telescopes with micrometers to measure the stars' positions at different times of the year. Wallis believed that this method could prove that fixed stars have different distances from Earth and help improve the understanding of celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
