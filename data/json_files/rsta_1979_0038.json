The authors provide a set of criteria for identifying potential uranium deposits and describe different types of uranium ore formations, such as conglomerates, palaeosurface-related vein-type deposits, sandstone deposits, and others. They also emphasize the importance of evaluating exploration areas based on the presence of indispensable conditions for ore formation and preservation.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Ore Deposits"}
