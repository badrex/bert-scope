Burch, presents an improved design for a capillary electrometer, focusing on the construction and adjustments of the instrument. The new design features a lightweight, flexible trough that supports the capillary, making it easier to adjust and clean. This improved electrometer offers better definition and is less fragile than previous models, making it a promising tool for future research."}
