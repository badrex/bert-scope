Smeaton conducted experiments to understand the natural powers of water and wind in turning mills and machines. He designed a model to study the effects of water and wind on a water wheel and found that the power of water and wind can be measured by the weight raised and the height it reaches in a given time. This research helped in understanding the efficiency of water and wind power in practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
