They found that serum from healthy individuals could agglutinate red blood cells from other healthy individuals, but not their own. The authors also discovered that heating serum at 60\u00b0C could enhance the agglutinative action, and that red blood cells exposed to high temperatures could still exert specific agglutinative actions. However, they found that sand heated to similar temperatures was inert.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
