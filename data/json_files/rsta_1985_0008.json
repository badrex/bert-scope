It explores the unique characteristics of TMTSF series conductors, which have open Fermi surfaces and exhibit one-dimensional properties. The article also reviews the anisotropic properties of these conductors and their relation to low-dimensional physics, focusing on the interplay between ground states of different natures and the influence of fluctuations on the electronic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
