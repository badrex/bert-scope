A simplified model is used to determine the critical Rayleigh number for nonlinear convection, which is essential for understanding the complex interactions between the Earth's climate, sea levels, and subsea permafrost. The study provides insights into the behavior of convection in the layer between the sea bed and permafrost, which is crucial for understanding the Earth's history and predicting future environmental changes."}
