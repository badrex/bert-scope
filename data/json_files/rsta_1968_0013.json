The authors employed both plane and defocused spherical Fabry-Perot interferometers to study the output spectral brightness of these lasers. They compared rotating prism and Pockels cell-switched systems and demonstrated the mode selection properties of resonant reflectors. Time-resolved spectroscopy revealed time and intensity-dependent blue and red frequency shifts, which were explained by the combined effects of rapid bleaching of the central region of an inhomogeneous distribution of population inversion and nonlinear anomalous dispersion in the ruby. These findings limit the spectral brightness obtainable from giant pulse ruby lasers and suggest methods to reduce frequency shifts and increase spectral brightness.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
