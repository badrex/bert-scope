Chr. Facio Duillier observed the total solar eclipse from Geneva. He described the surrounding darkness, the red and violet hues of the clouds, and the appearance of a white atmosphere around the moon. Duillier also discussed the possible height of the moon's atmosphere and the appearance of a crown around the sun during the eclipse, suggesting that it might be caused by vapors surrounding the sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational astronomy"}
