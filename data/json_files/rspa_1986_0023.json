The results show more covalent spin transfer than in similar systems, with higher 'overlap' populations. The interactions resemble those in the Ni-O bond, and the absence of spin in hydrogen atoms correlates with the essentially zero spin in the orbitals. The study provides insights into the bonding and spin density in transition metal complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
