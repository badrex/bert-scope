They found that the molecule is not planar, with the seven carbon atoms of the ring being coplanar, while the copper and oxygen atoms form a different plane. The molecule's departure from planarity allows for more effective van der Waals bonding between successive molecules. The bond lengths and angles were calculated and compared to previous two-dimensional analysis, resulting in more reasonable values.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
