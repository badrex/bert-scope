The first reaction is deceleratory and controlled by diffusive water loss, while the second reaction is a nucleation and growth process. A kinetic and mechanistic study has been undertaken to understand the dehydration mechanism, including electron microscopic examinations of the cleaved surfaces of partly reacted crystals. The findings provide insight into the structure of the dehydration interface and the mechanism of water release.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid state chemistry"}
