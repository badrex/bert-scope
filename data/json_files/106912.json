He described the phenomenon in a letter to the Rev. Samuel Vince and the Rev. Nevil Maskelyne. The light appeared to be a small star-like object, and it disappeared suddenly. Wilkins sought the opinion of Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, on the possible causes of the phenomenon, including volcanic activity on the Moon. This observation sparked further interest in lunar phenomena and celestial events.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Lunar Observation"}
