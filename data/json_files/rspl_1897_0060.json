Schuster uses Fourier analysis to calculate the probability and expectancy of earthquakes occurring within specific time intervals. Although the study does not definitively prove the influence of lunar and solar cycles on earthquakes, it highlights the importance of further research into the relationship between these factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
