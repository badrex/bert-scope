They found that glycogen disappears more rapidly from the liver of tumor-bearing rats than from the liver of normal rats. This result suggests that carbohydrates are used for the synthesis of protoplasm in growth, similar to the metabolic conditions observed in pregnant animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Carbohydrate Metabolism"}
