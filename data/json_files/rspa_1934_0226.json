They discovered two strong bands at 10,385 \u00c5 and 11,645 \u00c5 and found that the rotational structure of the bands could be explained by introducing the rotational constant to account for the stretching caused by centrifugal force. The authors also observed a pressure effect on the line width of the absorption bands, which they attributed to pressure broadening. This study provides insights into the molecular structure and properties of HCN.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular physics"}
