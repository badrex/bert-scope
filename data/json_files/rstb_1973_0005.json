It describes the structure and function of the sarcoplasmic reticulum and its relationship with the surface membrane, as well as the potential role of mitochondria in regulating intracellular cation levels. The study finds that smooth muscles with a larger volume of sarcoplasmic reticulum can contract even in calcium-free solutions, suggesting a connection between the structure and function of smooth muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Smooth Muscle Physiology"}
