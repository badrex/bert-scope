R. S., Dr. Schuster, and Mrs. Sidgwick to determine the value of the British Association unit of resistance in absolute measure. They used an improved apparatus and took three series of observations. The mean resistance of the standard at 13 inches, corrected for self-induction, was found to be 23.612 (in units of 10^9 CGS). The resistance in terms of B.A. units was 23.935, which led to the calculation that 1 B.A. unit equals approximately 0.98651 CGS units.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
