They studied gelatin gels, as well as agar, agarose, and acrylamide gels. The research showed that particles do not move with respect to the gel network in firm gels. The apparent motion arises from the deformation of the gel network due to electro-osmotic pressure build-up. The findings have implications for understanding gel structure and its behavior under electric fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
