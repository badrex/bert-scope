They discuss the basis of this method, its applications, and potential errors. The authors provide examples of how this method can be used to calculate angles between covalencies in various compounds, such as methylene chloride, bromide, and iodide, and chloroform, bromoform, and iodoform.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Geometry"}
