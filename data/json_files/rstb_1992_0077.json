The researchers found that the mean magnitude of the unmasking across their neural population was similar to the human psychophysical binaural masking level difference under the same signal and masker conditions. The results provide insights into how the auditory system processes complex sounds and contributes to the \"cocktail party\" effect, the ability to focus on one sound source in a noisy environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
