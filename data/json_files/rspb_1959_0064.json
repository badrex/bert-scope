They found that the banding patterns of the giant chromosomes in Canadian populations differ significantly from those in European populations, suggesting little migration between the two continents and possibly the existence of different races or incipient species. The study highlights the importance of genetic divergence in understanding the evolution of animal populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
