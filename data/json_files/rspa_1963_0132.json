They created an ion source with a differentially pumped electron beam filament chamber and line-of-sight access from the sampling pinhole to the ionization region. This design significantly reduced contamination of the sample by pyrolysis products formed from the sample on the hot filament, improving the accuracy of the mass spectrometer for studying chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
