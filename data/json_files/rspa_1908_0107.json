They used monochromatic or multichromatic light to illuminate the polarimeter's field, enabling the use of metallic arc spectra for polarimetric observations. This method was particularly useful for measuring the rotatory power of substances in the ultra-violet region.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
