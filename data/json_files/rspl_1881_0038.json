The authors study the effect of external discharges on the internal discharge and observe that the striae can cast shadows in the radiant showers coming from the inside of the tube. The experiments provide insights into the nature of the striae and the relationship between the internal and external discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
