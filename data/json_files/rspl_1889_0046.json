The deposits were formed through the process of double decomposition, involving barium carbonate and calcium sulfate. The deposits were mainly composed of barium sulfate, with smaller amounts of strontium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and other minerals. These deposits were of interest due to their potential use as a cementing material in sandstone and their impact on the functionality of water-boxes and pipes in coal-mines.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
