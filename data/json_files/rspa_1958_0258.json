They utilized the explosives as waveguide filling, taking advantage of their low-loss dielectric properties in the centimetric spectrum. This method provided high-resolution distance measurements of the detonation front, contributing to the understanding of how detonation starts and grows through its transient condition to steady high-order detonation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
