They found that the distribution of arteries is precise and that the final areas of arterial supply correspond to structural areas of functional value. The study emphasizes the importance of using correct nomenclature and criteria for homology in understanding arterial distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
