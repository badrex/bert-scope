It focuses on triply periodic minimal surfaces (TPMS) and their significance in biological materials and other non-crystalline structures. The authors discuss various methods for generating and analyzing TPMS, including Weierstrass parametrization, analytical derivation, and finite element methods like the Surface Evolver.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
