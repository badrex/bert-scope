The Mesozoic-Tertiary evolution of the basin is divided into four major episodes, influenced by tectonic activity and changing environments. The basin's geological knowledge has been crucial for hydrocarbon exploration, leading to the discovery of over 20 economic accumulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
