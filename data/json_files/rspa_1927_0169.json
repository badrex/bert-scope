They found that these collisions are elastic within the limits of experimental error. The study also showed that if any kinetic energy is lost during the collision, it must be less than a certain value. This research contributes to the understanding of atomic interactions and nuclear energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
