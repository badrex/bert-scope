The authors discuss the linear and nonlinear theories of unstable detonations, as well as the interaction of asymptotic and numerical methods in predicting detonation instability. They also highlight the importance of understanding unstable detonations for improving numerical methods and developing better models for real-world applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
