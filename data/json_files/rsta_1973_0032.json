They found that the gas samples contained varying amounts of water, carbon dioxide, and sulfur dioxide, and that the concentration of sulfur dioxide was lower during the eruption compared to previous years. The researchers also noted that the water content of the gases was influenced by the nature of the material through which the conduits passed, such as snow layers and ash-lava layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
