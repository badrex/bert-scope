They discovered that environmental factors, such as wind and air turbulence, play a crucial role in spore dissemination. The authors also highlighted the importance of understanding the variables responsible for the rate of disease development, including the host, pathogen, and environment, to effectively control and prevent epidemics in glasshouses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
