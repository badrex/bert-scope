It focuses on the role of Legendre dual transformation and the systematic method of deriving reciprocal variational principles. The paper also discusses the relevance of optimization theory and its potential applications to boundary value problems in continuum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Optimization"}
