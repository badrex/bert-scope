They measured the infrared chemiluminescence and kinetics of relaxation to understand the rates of formation and quenching of vibrationally excited molecules. The results provide insights into the energy transfer and relaxation processes in molecular systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
