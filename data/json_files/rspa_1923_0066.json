The authors prove that these two hypotheses are equivalent and discuss various consequences of the Lindel\u00f6f hypothesis. They also establish the equivalence of several propositions related to the zeta-function and its applications to the divisor problems of Dirichlet and Piltz.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analytic Number Theory"}
