The researchers discovered that hydroquinone, and not catechol, is responsible for hardening the puparium. They also found that larval cuticles can produce catechol and hydroquinone from phenylalanine and tyrosine, suggesting that these dihydroxyphenols play a role in the hardening process. However, direct evidence for their involvement is still lacking.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
