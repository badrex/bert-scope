They found that the lutein cells are formed by the enlargement of the follicular epithelium, and the theca interna cells play a role in the formation of the corpus luteum. The authors also observed differences in the theca interna cells and their functions in various species. The study provides insights into the reproductive biology of mice and rabbits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
