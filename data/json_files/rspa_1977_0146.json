They derive a unique set of field equations with 16 variables, representing a natural generalization applicable to various physical purposes. The theory is based on the concept of variational derivatives and introduces new elements to maintain consistency with the general principle of covariance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
