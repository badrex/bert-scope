They discovered that the cooling phase (Q2) consists of two components: one that depends on the external resistive load and another that is independent of it. The existence of the open-circuit cooling raises questions about its origin, possibly involving a coupling between the efflux of K+ ions and a chemical reaction, such as ATP synthesis by reversal of the sodium pump.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Bioelectricity"}
