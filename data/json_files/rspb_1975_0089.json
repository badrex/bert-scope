They found that the drone fly's color vision is more similar to typical flies than bees, with more blue-sensitive receptors and less green-sensitive ones. The study also revealed that the polarization sensitivity of the cells with two spectral peaks is influenced by the presence of three visual pigments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
