They describe the various bones and structures that make up the skull, including the rostrum, parietals, squamosals, frontals, ethmo-nasals, nasals, prenasal bone, premaxillaries, vomers, maxillary chain, pterygoid, meso-pterygoid, preopercular, and more. This research provides valuable insights into the anatomy and evolution of fish skulls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Development"}
