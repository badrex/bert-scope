He found that the length of the needle significantly affects its deviation, and the efficacy of a small mass of iron as a compensation for more distant masses depends on its distance from the needle. The author also proposed equations to determine the deviations of a horizontal needle due to the action of an iron sphere or shell, and his hypothesis is consistent with all the experiments made.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
