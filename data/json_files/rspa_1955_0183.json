The study focuses on the role of aluminium impurities in the formation of these colour centres. Using paramagnetic resonance, the researchers discovered that each colour centre is associated with an aluminium atom, and the model suggests that the aluminium atom is at a silicon site in the lattice with the unpaired electron in a localized orbital on one of the nearest oxygen atoms. The findings provide insights into the optical absorption spectrum and the interaction between different colour centres in smoky quartz.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
