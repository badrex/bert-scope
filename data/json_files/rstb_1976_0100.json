The authors explore the different conformations of the virus and the forces responsible for its structure, including hydrophobic and electrostatic interactions. They also investigate the formation of empty capsids and the conditions required for in vitro morphogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
