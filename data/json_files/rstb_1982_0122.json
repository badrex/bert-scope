The author explains two types of stabilization mechanisms: microtubule-independent and microtubule-dependent processes. The article also highlights the importance of cytoskeletal elements in determining cell shape and directionality during spreading and locomotion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
