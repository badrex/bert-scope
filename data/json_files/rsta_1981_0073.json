It examines the extensional tectonics, stress patterns, and structural processes responsible for the deformation in the area. The study highlights the differences in the timing and stress orientations between the northern and southern subprovinces of the Basin and Range province, which are related to plate interactions along the western boundary of North America.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
