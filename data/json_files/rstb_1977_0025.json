The author highlights the importance of understanding these processes for the successful evolution of allopolyploids and the regulation of chromosome matching. The article also challenges the assumption that synapsis is a precondition for crossing over and proposes alternative models for the relationship between synapsis and crossover events.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
