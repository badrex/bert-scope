The author explains the enzymatic processes involved in the rearrangement of porphobilinogen into uroporphyrinogen III, which is crucial for the formation of haem, chlorophyll, and vitamin B12. The article also highlights the use of carbon-13 labeling and the study of intermediates to understand the biosynthetic process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
