It demonstrates that blastocoele fluid contains a toxic factor that selectively kills cells with trophectodermal potential, leading to cell death and tissue renewal. This finding has implications for understanding programmed cell death and tissue renewal mechanisms in the embryo and adult organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
