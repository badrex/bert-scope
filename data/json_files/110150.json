The instrument measures the distances of equal radiation and helps determine the ratio of the heats radiated at equal distances. By conducting experiments with heated iron balls and flat surfaces, Ritchie concludes that the law of the decrease of heat by radiation is based on fact and that a constant portion of heat is radiated directly out from the surface without divergence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
