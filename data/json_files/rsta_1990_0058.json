The authors predict that deep-sea animals, such as echiurans and sipunculids, may use caching as a strategy to store rich food from seasonal or episodic pulses. This behavior can have significant effects on sediment stratigraphy. The authors also discuss other possible strategies, such as rapid assimilation and population growth, and the role of deposit feeders in altering the deep-sea environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
