They found that heavy hydrogen, later known as deuterium, has different properties than regular hydrogen, such as a different boiling point and spectral lines. This discovery expanded the understanding of hydrogen's isotopes and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nuclear Chemistry"}
