The authors review the progress made in understanding isotopic constitution, the relative abundance of isotopes, and the application of optical methods to determine the presence of isotopes. They also explore the use of wave-mechanical ideas to explain nuclear problems and the role of energy levels in the structure of nuclei. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding the origin of gamma rays and its potential to shed light on the detailed structure of the nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
