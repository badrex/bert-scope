The authors discuss the processes involved in particle formation, the impact of biological processes on downward carbon transport, and the transformations that occur during sinking and upon arrival on the deep-sea floor. The study highlights the importance of understanding these processes to better comprehend the exchanges between the ocean and atmosphere and their impact on atmospheric CO2 content.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
