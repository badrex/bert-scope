They observed the effects of different light frequencies, durations, and intensities on the perception of color patterns in the zooplankton Hippolyte. The findings provide insights into the physiological luminosity and brightness differences between binocular and uniocular vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
