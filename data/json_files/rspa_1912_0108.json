They placed copper plates above and below the heater to maintain a uniform temperature and reduce the impact of uneven thickness in the metallic layers. This method allowed them to estimate the heat loss and improve the accuracy of their measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
