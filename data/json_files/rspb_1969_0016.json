The study found that the pore radii are larger in sapwood than in heartwood, and the average number of pores per tracheid varies with species but is always around one. This research provides valuable insights into the structure and function of conifer wood.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Tree Physiology"}
