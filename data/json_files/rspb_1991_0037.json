They developed an in vitro system to study this process and found that the RNaseH activity is necessary for removing the 5' RNA sequences from the cDNA-RNA hybrid, allowing it to translocate to another RNA with a complementary target sequence. This research provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of retroviral replication and the role of RNaseH activity in the first template-switching event.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
