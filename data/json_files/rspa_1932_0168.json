He finds that the term for interchangeability can be identified with the electrostatic and electromagnetic energy of two charges, and that the coefficient of this term is the integer 137, known as the fine structure constant. This work contributes to the understanding of the behavior of electric charges and their role in quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
