Beale, investigated the structure of the grey matter in the brains of humans, sheep, cats, and dogs. He discovered that nerve cells are connected by fibers and that these fibers can be traced for a considerable distance. The so-called \"granular matter\" in the grey matter is made up of very fine nerve fibers. In the adult brain, cells are not often connected with the nearest neighboring cells. The nerve cells only influence the nerve fibers that are structurally continuous with them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
