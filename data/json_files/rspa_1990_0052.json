The researchers used a water-tunnel and a new paint-coating method to visualize the surface flow patterns and answer questions about open and closed separation. The findings provide a better understanding of the flow behavior and help improve the design of aerospace vehicles and other engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
