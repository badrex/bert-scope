They examined the cross-reactivity of the antisera with other phospholipase A2 enzymes and polypeptide neurotoxins. The antisera inhibited both the neurotoxic effects of P-bungarotoxin at the frog motor endplate and the enzymatic activity of the toxin on model phospholipid membranes. This study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms of P-bungarotoxin's neuromuscular action and the role of enzyme activity in this action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuropharmacology"}
