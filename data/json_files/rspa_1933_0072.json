They discovered strong backward scattering at certain angles and observed that the diffraction patterns change with the energy of the electrons. This work provided evidence of the diffraction of electrons and contributed to the understanding of electron scattering in gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum mechanics"}
