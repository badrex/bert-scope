Bacteria produce siderophores, which remove iron from iron-binding proteins, and new outer-membrane proteins to help in iron uptake. Additionally, alterations in tRNA molecules occur during iron restriction, which may play a role in cellular regulation and metabolic flexibility.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
