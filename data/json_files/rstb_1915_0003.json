The authors conducted experiments to understand the impact of environmental factors on crop development and yield. They found that spacing significantly affects the flowering, bolling, and weight of the cotton, leading to improved agricultural practices and potentially increasing crop yield.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture"}
