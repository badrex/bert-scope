The author finds that the liquid state has a limit, an isothermal line passing through the critical point. They also discover a novel classification of matter into four states: gaseous, vaporous, liquid, and solid. The research includes experiments with various liquids and gases, such as alcohol, hydrogen, and nitrogen, to observe the behavior of surface tension and capillarity under high pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
