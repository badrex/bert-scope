The author, S. A. Sworn, conducted experiments to determine the effects of capillarity and to compare English flint glass and French Jena normal glass thermometers. The findings contribute to the development of more reliable and precise thermometers for temperature measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
