It explores the possibility that pulsars, particularly the youngest ones, could contribute to the cosmic rays. The author also examines the distribution of pulsars and their properties, suggesting that the apparent shoulder in the cosmic-ray spectrum may represent the addition of pulsars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
