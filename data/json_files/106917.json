The author explains how evaporation causes a less refraction near the surface of the sea, leading to objects appearing elevated above the horizon. The author also provides a theory and observations of this phenomenon, using a vessel as an example to explain the refraction of light in horizontal refractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
