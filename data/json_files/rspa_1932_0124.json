They study the distribution and behavior of the resulting luminosity and discover the presence of metastable atoms in the glowing mercury vapor. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of fluorescence and the properties of long-lived excited atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
