He described the different types of papillae, their structure, and the blood vessels and nerves within them. Waller also observed the passage of red and white blood cells in the capillaries and the role of compression in increasing congestion. This study provided a deeper understanding of the organ of taste and its functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
