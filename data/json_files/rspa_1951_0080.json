The research explores the effects of viscosity and diffusion on the quenching process, providing insights into the relation between molecular encounter frequencies in gas and solution states. The findings contribute to the understanding of quenching processes and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
