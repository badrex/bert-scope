They used gas-liquid chromatography, adsorption, and reversed-phase partition film chromatography to determine the composition of the hydrocarbon fraction and the nonacosane derivatives. This study provides insight into the importance of nonacosane and its derivatives in plant lipids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
