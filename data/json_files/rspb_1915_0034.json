The researchers found that the insects reared from the eggs were all parthenogenetic females. They discovered that there are at least two main categories of color varieties: those with green pigment and those without. The study also found that the color patterns of the insects remain the same when they hatch, and color changes occur during the moulting process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Inheritance"}
