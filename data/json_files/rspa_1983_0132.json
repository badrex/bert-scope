The wave set-up drives an offshore bottom current called the undertow and influences the inshore circulation. The research also shows that the set-up can create an internal flow or circulation of water within the beach, affecting the porosity of the beach material.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
