The researchers found that mAChR II and mAChR IV preferentially couple to calcium currents, inhibiting them. This inhibition may contribute to the autoinhibition of transmitter release and increase membrane excitability by reducing calcium-activated potassium currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuropharmacology"}
