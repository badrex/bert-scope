It explores the mechanisms by which microorganisms maintain a stable water content and the role of solutes in growth-limiting water activity. The article also examines the adaptation mechanisms, such as the accumulation of compatible solutes like proline, that allow microorganisms to survive in low water activity environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
