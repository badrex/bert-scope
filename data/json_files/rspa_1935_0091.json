The study reveals that the carbon atoms in the compound are distorted from a regular hexagon, with evidence of contraction at the double bonds and alterations in the valency angles within the ring. The findings also provide insights into the dimensions and situation of the oxygen atoms in benzoquinone.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
