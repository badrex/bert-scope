They found that the compounds have an open structure with chains of carbon atoms loosely packed and parallel to each other. The intensity distribution of the X-ray reflections is explained by the arrangement of the carbon atoms in sets of equidistant layers, with strong reflecting planes containing the chain axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
