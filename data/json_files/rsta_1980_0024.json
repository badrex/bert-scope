It explores the changes in palaeo-oceanography, margin stratigraphy, and palaeophysiography during the Tertiary period, focusing on the impact of bathymetric evolution, geographical development, and climatic fluctuations on the region's oceanography. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the geological history of the area for better correlation and interpretation of sediment records.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
