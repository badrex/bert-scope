They demonstrate the appropriateness of the method for various problems in rigid body dynamics and explore the composition of twists and wrenches. The theory is also used to resolve wrenches and twist velocities about six screws of reference, and to find the single screw reciprocal to five given screws.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Vector Calculus"}
