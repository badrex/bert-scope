They find that the organism remains pathogenic when injected into mice, rats, and hamsters. Cortisone treatment enhances the number of liver lesions produced by the infection. Penicillin is found to be effective in treating the infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
