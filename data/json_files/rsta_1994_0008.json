It explores the anomalous flavor ratio observed for atmospheric neutrinos and investigates the potential role of neutrino oscillations in explaining this anomaly. The article also examines the impact of nuclear effects on the predicted ratio of interactions and the importance of precise measurements and calibration of detectors to clarify the situation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
