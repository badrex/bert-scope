They examine the process theoretically and show how the partial differential equations of this kind of problem can be reduced to a set of ordinary differential equations, which can be more easily handled numerically. An approximate solution is obtained, demonstrating how the average particle size depends on the rate of cooling and the time of quenching.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
