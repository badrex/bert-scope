The unit cell contains 2 zinc ions, 6 insulin molecules, and about 283 water molecules. The crystal structure reveals the formation of a compact dimer and the further aggregation of three dimers to form a hexamer around two zinc ions. The authors also discuss the distribution of hydrogen bonds within the protein molecules and between water and protein, as well as the relation of the crystal structure to the biological activity of insulin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
