The author calculates the pressure produced by uterine contractions and abdominal muscle tension, determining that these forces are sufficient to complete the first stage of labor and expel the fetus during the second stage. The study provides valuable insights into the mechanics of childbirth and the role of various muscles in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
