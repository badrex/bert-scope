The researchers found that the concentration dependence of the critical resolved shear stress at the yield point for both alloy series can be described by a power law. The results establish the stress equivalence behavior of single crystals of these alloys and provide insights into solute hardening and the development of high-yield stress alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
