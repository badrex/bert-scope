The author presents a theoretical analysis of forced waves and distinguishes between the \"minor tremor\" and the \"main shock.\" The study contributes to the understanding of earthquake mechanics and the application of elastic theory to real-world conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
