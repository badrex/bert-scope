The experiment proved that the scattering was not due to dust but a property of pure air, and its intensity was of the expected order of magnitude. The author also ruled out the possibility of fluorescence by performing a spectroscopic examination of the scattered light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Optics"}
