At least 77 genera in 8 orders were identified, with Rakata being the richest in terms of orders and genera. The majority of nematodes found belong to the Rhabditida and Dorylaimida orders. The authors discuss the possible survival of these organisms after the 1883 eruption and their potential role in the islands' biogeography.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
