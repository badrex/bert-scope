They observed and compared the spectra produced by different gases and flames, including hydrocarbon flames, cyanogen flames, and carbonic oxide flames. The study aimed to understand the nature of the spectra and the chemical composition of the compounds involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
