It explains how homeotic genes are responsible for the development of specific groups of precursor cells and how cell lineage analysis has been useful in studying the mode of action of these genes. The main findings include the cell autonomy of most homeotic genes, their action on anatomical units defined by compartment boundaries, and the requirement of some genes until the end of the larval period. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the realms of action of homeotic genes and how they coincide with compartment boundaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
