They found that copper induced convulsions and death in pigeons and inhibited pigeon and rat brain mitochondria. The study also showed that chelating agents like penicillamine and lipoate could protect against the toxic action of copper. The results suggest that copper may directly affect cell surfaces, rather than altering the charge on some membrane surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Toxicology"}
