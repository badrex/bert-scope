The author, Wyville Thomson, observes the growth and changes in the larva, from its initial stages to the formation of the Crinoid skeleton. He also introduces the concept of \"pseudembryo\" to describe the independently organized zooids found in echinoderms. The study provides insights into the morphological and physiological relations of the larval zooid and its role in the development of the species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinoderm Development"}
