They found that predicted water structures were highly sensitive to the input parameters used to define non-bonded and electrostatic interactions. The study highlights the importance of investigating potential functions and their parameters for accurate predictions of solvent organization in complex water-protein systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry", "sub_discipline": "Molecular Modeling and Simulation"}
