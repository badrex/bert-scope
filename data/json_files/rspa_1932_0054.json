They studied the magnetostriction along the crystal axis and found that it follows the square law. The author also observed a more complicated magnetostriction phenomenon perpendicular to the crystal axis, which showed a deviation from the square law and a saturation effect at lower temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
