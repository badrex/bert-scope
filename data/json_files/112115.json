He discovered a pale yellow oil with an aromatic and slightly alliaceous odor, which contained a considerable amount of sulfur. The oil reacted violently with nitric acid, producing a crystalline mass. Two colorless crystalline substances were separated from the solution, resembling chlorate of potassa in appearance. Stenhouse is currently examining these substances and plans to share the results of his investigations with the Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
