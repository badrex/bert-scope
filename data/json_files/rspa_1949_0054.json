They discovered that the turbulent motion within the jets is solely responsible for the turbulent transfer of momentum, while diffusion of turbulent energy and heat is carried out by the bulk movement of the jets. The study provides a self-consistent description of the wake, which represents the main features of wake motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
