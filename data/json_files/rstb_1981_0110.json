It highlights the importance of prostacyclin in regulating platelet aggregation and suggests that an imbalance in prostaglandin metabolism may contribute to bleeding tendencies in uraemic patients. The article also explores the potential role of prostacyclin in the pathogenesis of thrombotic microangiopathy and pre-eclampsia, and the possible involvement of plasma factors in regulating prostaglandin synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Hematology and Vascular Biology"}
