The author, J. Norman Lockyer, found that as the sun-spot period changes from minimum to maximum, the lines of known terrestrial elements disappear, and new lines appear that do not have terrestrial equivalents. This suggests that the solar atmosphere's temperature and disturbance level affect the presence of elements in the solar spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
