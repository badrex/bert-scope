The study provides insights into the molecular and mechanistic details of PIC regulation and its coupling to phosphoinositidase C activity. This model system offers valuable information on the substrate specificity of PIC and its mode of regulation by hormones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
