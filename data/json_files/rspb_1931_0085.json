They used a closed air space chamber to perfuse the systems and measure blood flows, pressures, and respiratory pressures. The results showed that the pulmonary arterial pressure response to changes in aortic or bronchial arterial pressure is complex and varies between animals and during the course of the experiment. This research helps to understand the functioning of the respiratory system and the interactions between the pulmonary and bronchial circulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
