The hailstones were large, some weighing five ounces, and caused significant damage to windows, crops, and livestock. The hailstorm was part of a cloud that traveled over 60 miles, and its unusual persistence and the size of the hailstones were considered the most extraordinary aspects of the event.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
