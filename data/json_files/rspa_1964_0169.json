They found that the Fermi surfaces of potassium and rubidium are nearly spherical, with departures from sphericity of about 1% for potassium and slightly less for rubidium. These results are compared to band structure calculations, providing insights into the behavior of these materials under magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
