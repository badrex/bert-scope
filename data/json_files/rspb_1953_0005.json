They use infrared examination to study the properties of the inhibitor and provide evidence that the compound is barium fluoro-citrate. This research helps to understand the mechanism of fluoroacetate poisoning and the effects on citrate metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
