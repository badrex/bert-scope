They discovered two mechanisms of acetylcholine release: one dependent on extracellular calcium and activated by light or depolarization, and another independent of calcium and unaffected by large depolarizations. The latter mechanism, similar to the \"acetylcholine leakage\" at the neuromuscular junction, accounts for about two-thirds of the total acetylcholine release in the dark. The findings provide insights into the role of acetylcholine in the retina and its potential effects on retinal ganglion cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
