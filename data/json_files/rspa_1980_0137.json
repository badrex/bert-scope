The author integrates the equations of motion using a Runge-Kutta technique and discusses the effects of round-off errors and viscosity on the calculations. The study shows that a process of rolling-up of vorticity occurs, and the results provide insight into the behavior of vortex sheets in fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
