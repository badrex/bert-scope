The authors found that the diffusion coefficient increases in the direction of stretch and that the overall range of concentration is less due to the restricted swelling of the polymer. The degree of anisotropy is studied for chloroform and acetone, providing new evidence on the nature of the sharp boundaries seen under the microscope when a penetrant enters a polymer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
