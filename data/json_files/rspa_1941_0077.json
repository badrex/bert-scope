They propose that the crystal is broken up into small, approximately parallel elements, and that the essential feature of the phenomenon is the supposition that these elements scatter independently. The author also discusses the phase relationships between waves scattered by atoms throughout the crystal, which remains a single structure but is distorted by heat waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
