The research explores the tilting and wrinkling of ionization density surfaces, as well as the horizontal movements in the ionosphere, which can impact the direction of propagation of reflected waves. The findings provide insights into understanding the complex behavior of the ionosphere and its impact on radio communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
