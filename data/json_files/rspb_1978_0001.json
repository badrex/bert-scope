It shows that glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase activity is higher in heterocysts than in vegetative cells, and the electron transport system operates equally well in the light and dark. This research provides insights into the role of the photosynthetic electron transport chain in providing reductant for nitrogenase and the regulation of the electron transport system in heterocysts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis and Plant Physiology"}
