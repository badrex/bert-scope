They used spectrograms and a Fabry-Perot interferometer to study the isotope shifts and hyperfine structures in the spectrum, providing a more accurate understanding of the term structure and its implications for the interpretation of isotope shifts and associated hyperfine structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
