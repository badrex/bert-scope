Hugens explains the odd phenomenon of quicksilver remaining suspended above the usual height in Torricellian experiments. He suggests that there is a second pressure, stronger than air pressure, exerted by a more subtle matter that penetrates glass, water, quicksilver, and other bodies. This additional pressure, combined with air pressure, can support the height of the mercury in the experiment. M. Hugens provides three experiments to support his theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
