They found that the intraperitoneal route was the most effective method of infecting the hamsters. The study also showed that the striped hamsters could be infected through percutaneous and subcutaneous routes, and that the Chinese striped hamster is highly susceptible to infection with flagellates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
