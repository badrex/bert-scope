This structure consists of three infinite periodic minimal surfaces, partitioning space into three congruent regions. The authors also discuss the potential for equilibrium structures with intermediate values of the dimensionless boundary line density and the role of handedness in these structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
