The equilibrium constants and heat of association of these complexes are determined, revealing that diethyl ether forms the strongest bond with hydrogen fluoride. The far-infrared spectra of these complexes are also recorded, observing a band associated with the intermolecular stretching vibration of the complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
