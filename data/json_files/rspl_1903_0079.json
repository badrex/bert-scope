The authors conducted experiments using sealed glass tubes exposed to heat in steam at various temperatures and times. The results showed that anthrax bacteria were rarely found to survive even at temperatures of 100\u00b0C for as short as 20-30 seconds. This research provides valuable insights into effective sterilization techniques for water purification in military settings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
