The authors found that the relationship between crystal strains and irradiation dose can be used to estimate high-temperature behavior of graphites and improve their understanding of dimensional changes in various polycrystalline graphite materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Materials Science"}
