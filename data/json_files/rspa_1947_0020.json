They develop a treatment that accounts for both translational and rotational processes, providing better agreement with experimental results in moderate fields. The study focuses on the planes (100), (110), and (111) and reveals anomalies in the normal component of magnetization, which could not be explained by the existing single-vector treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
