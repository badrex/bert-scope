The authors argue against the commonly-received opinion about the outlet of the ovarian system and propose new views on the structures that serve this function. They provide evidence through injections, dissections, and observations of the reproductive process in Anodonta Cygnea, a common fresh-water mussel. The paper supports the idea that the anatomy of these bivalve mollusks corresponds with that of higher tribes in the same series.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Mollusks"}
