They found that the conducting-power of both metals decreases with increasing temperature. The results showed that thallium and iron follow different patterns of conductivity, with thallium having a higher percentage decrement in conducting-power compared to iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermoelectricity"}
