He pioneered electrophysiological techniques and equipment, and his research on lung afferents and cardiopulmonary receptors provided valuable insights into respiratory distress and heart failure. Whitteridge also collaborated with Ludwig Guttmann to analyze and explain the disturbances of blood pressure and temperature control in paraplegic patients.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
