The author reviews their radio and optical properties, electromagnetic spectra, and the relation between their various nuclear components. The article also explores the spatial scales of the materials emitting in different wavebands and their possible connections to the thermal gas responsible for optical emission lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > X-ray Astronomy"}
