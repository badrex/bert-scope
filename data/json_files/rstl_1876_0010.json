They describe the stages of dental development, the role of enamel-organ, and the differences in tooth formation between these fish groups and mammals. The research provides valuable insights into the evolution of teeth and dental development in vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
