The author reviews classical genetic studies and recent work on plant transgenes, exploring the molecular basis of these phenomena in terms of modern hypotheses on chromatin organization. The article highlights the importance of understanding epigenetic variants in plants, as they may reflect fundamental mechanisms of plant developmental control and have implications for processes such as transitions from juvenility to adulthood and the elaboration of pigmentation patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
