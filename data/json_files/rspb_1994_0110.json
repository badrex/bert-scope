The author conducted experiments using artificial nests with two-way radios hidden inside to measure changes in predation rates with changes in begging. The results showed that begging was costly for ground-nesting birds but not for those nesting in trees. The cost of begging for ground-nesters was an increasing function of the begging rate. This suggests that nest predation could act as a check on the exaggeration of begging traits and enforce the honesty of begging signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
