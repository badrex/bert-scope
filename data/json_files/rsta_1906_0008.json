The results were analyzed to determine the differences between the observed and computed values of gravity. The author also examines the controversy surrounding BASEVI's pendulum results and the physical meaning of the deficiency of gravity found in Himalayan regions. The article concludes by discussing the importance of pendulum observations and their impact on understanding the force of gravity in India.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
