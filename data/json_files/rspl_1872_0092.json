They discovered that placing the leaf or leaf stalk on electrodes creates a current, which they called the normal leaf-current. When a fly enters the leaf, the plant reacts by closing its mouthparts and causing a negative variation in the current. This research showed that the Venus Flytrap can sense and respond to electrical signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
