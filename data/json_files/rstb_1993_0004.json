Invariance-seeking methods assume that a specified property of the surface texture is invariant, while value-seeking methods assume that the value of a specified property (anisotropy) is known. These methods are tested on images of planar textured surfaces, demonstrating their effectiveness in shape estimation from texture.", "scientific_discipline": "Computer Science > Computer Vision"}
