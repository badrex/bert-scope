The telescope used a 4-foot reflector and an equatorial mount, and it was designed to be more cost-effective and easier to construct than an achromatic telescope. The Great Melbourne Telescope contributed to advancements in celestial photography and provided valuable insights into the study of nebulae.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Telescope design"}
