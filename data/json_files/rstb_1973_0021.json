The study finds that the light chains occur in non-stoichiometric amounts in a myosin molecule and have different chemical compositions. The exact function of the light chains remains speculative, but there is evidence suggesting that the presence of one of the light chains is not required for the hydrolytic activity of this myosin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
