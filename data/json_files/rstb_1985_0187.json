It examines the patterns of expression of homeotic and segmentation genes and suggests that the domains of homeotic gene expression are related to lineage boundaries and compartment boundaries within segments. The study also highlights the differences in patterning mechanisms underlying the expression of different genes and the importance of understanding when lineage restrictions are established in relation to these expression patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
