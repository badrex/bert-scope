They propose a new term for this process and explain how it can cause significant changes in rocks, particularly in mountain ranges. The author also explores the role of heat generated by compression in geological transformations and its potential impact on the understanding of volcanic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
