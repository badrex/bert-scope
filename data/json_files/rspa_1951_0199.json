The authors transform the equations of unsteady compressible flow into those of a steady flow with non-conservative external forces and a field of sinks. They analyze the flow patterns and characteristics, including the possibility of Prandtl-Meyer flow and sonic curves, in both subsonic and supersonic cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
