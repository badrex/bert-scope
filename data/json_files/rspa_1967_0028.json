They found that only enstatite achondrites showed strong luminescence, with the red and blue luminescent grains being responsible for the different spectra. The study suggests that the difference between these two types of grains is due to the manganese content. Other meteorite classes were found to luminesce weakly, and their spectra changed with proton damage.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
