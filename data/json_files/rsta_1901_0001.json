They discuss the conditions of atmospheric permanence and the critical velocity-ratio, considering the escape of molecules from planets. The study also explores the modification of Boltzmann-Maxwell distribution to account for axial rotation and its implications on planetary atmospheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas dynamics"}
