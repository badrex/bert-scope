These plants provide valuable information about the early evolution of angiosperms and their possible origin in the Mesozoic era. The author also developed a new technique for studying the internal structure of these fossils, which has potential for future paleobotanical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
