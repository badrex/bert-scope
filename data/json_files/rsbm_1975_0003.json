Born in 1888 in Dumfriesshire, Scotland, Brown's early life was marked by self-sufficiency and hard work on his family's farm. He went on to study at the University of Edinburgh, where he excelled in mathematics, physics, and chemistry before transitioning to plant physiology and botany. Brown then worked as a research student under Professor V.H. Blackman at the Imperial College of Science and Technology (University of London) and later became a professor of plant pathology. His work and influence on the field of mycology and plant pathology are likely to be long-lasting, and his life story serves as an example of the intersection of science and personal history."}
