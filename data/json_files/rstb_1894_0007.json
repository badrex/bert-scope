The researchers found that different types of wandering cells have distinct morphological and functional characteristics, and they play a crucial role in the immune response and inflammation. The study contributes to a broader understanding of the natural history of wandering cells and their role in immunity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
