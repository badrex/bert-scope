The researchers found that axenically cultured Symbiodinium microadriaticum strains could be separated into 12 strains based on isoenzyme and soluble protein patterns. These findings suggest that there may be genetic differences among the strains, which could impact their symbiotic relationships with their host organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
