They describe experiments with a model plant and discuss the factors that contribute to water movement, such as the difference in vapor pressure between the soil and the leaves. The author also addresses common misconceptions and recent evidence supporting the cohesion-tension theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
