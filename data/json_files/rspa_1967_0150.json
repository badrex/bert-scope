The results show that increasing the strain rate leads to higher yield stress, a wider temperature range for twinning, and a more extensive region of brittle behavior. The research also provides evidence that cleavage fracture is always preceded by twinning.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
