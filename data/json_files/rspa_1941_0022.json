It also explores the natural frequencies of vibrating systems with restricted freedom and the determination of dielectric constants of conducting liquids. Additionally, the article presents X-ray spectroscopy techniques for analyzing the level systems of substances in the solid state.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
