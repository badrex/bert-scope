They study the development and structure of sporangia and synangia, and explore the relationship between Ophioglossaceae and Lycopods. The author concludes that both families likely share a common ancestor and that Ophioglossum may represent a series of increasing complexity in the family.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
