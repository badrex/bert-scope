He used sound and dry specimens, measured their dimensions accurately, and applied straining power to find the deflection. The modulus of torsion in woods ranged from about 9,000 to 30,000 pounds, following the order of specific gravity. In metals, the modulus of torsion is one-sixteenth of the modulus of elasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
