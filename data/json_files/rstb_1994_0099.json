The author explains the structural and molecular aspects of apoptosis, highlighting the involvement of genes that are part of the oncogene and oncosuppressor gene families. The article also explores the genetic regulation of apoptosis and the role of oncogenes, such as c-myc, and oncosuppressor genes in controlling cell death.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
