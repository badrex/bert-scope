The main finding is a 10% increase in the total proton-proton cross-section in the energy range studied. The article also reviews the features of the CERN Intersecting Storage Rings and the methods used to measure the cross-sections and elastic scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
