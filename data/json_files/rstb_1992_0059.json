They found that while some of Marr's assumptions were incorrect, his conclusion that each Purkinje cell can learn to respond to a large number of different patterns of activity in the mossy fibers is substantially correct. The simulation provided insights into Marr's theory and demonstrated the cerebellum's role in motor control and learning.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
