They analyzed the properties of the muscle fiber, including resistance and capacitance, and suggested that these properties could indicate the resistivity of the myoplasm and the capacitance of the surface membrane of the fiber. The findings have implications for understanding the structure and function of muscle fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
