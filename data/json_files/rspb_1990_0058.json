Both fractions were found to cause egg hatching and release of larvae from isolated barnacle egg masses. The study found that the natural eicosanoid responsible for egg hatching in barnacles in vivo is not an MHFA, but a THFA fraction, which is secreted into the mantle cavity and expelled with the larvae into the sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
