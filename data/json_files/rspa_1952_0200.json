They found that impurities significantly increased the reaction rate and altered its kinetic relationships. The extracted charcoal showed a fractional order with respect to carbon monoxide and steam, while the original charcoal had a higher order with respect to carbon monoxide and a lower order with respect to steam. This suggests that impurities provide a more reactive surface for the oxidation of carbon monoxide by steam.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
