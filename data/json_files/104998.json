He challenges the theories of Buffon and the author of Telliamed, who believe that the earth was covered in water for thousands of years, leading to the gradual formation of fossils. Wright argues that Orthoceratites and other marine fossils are found near the surface, suggesting a sudden catastrophic event, such as the biblical flood, transported them there. He also notes that mountains, which are composed of vitrifiable matter, do not contain marine fossils, further refuting Buffon's theory that they were formed by sea currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
