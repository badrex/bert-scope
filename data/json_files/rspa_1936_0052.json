They found that the initial product of hydrocarbon combustion is the corresponding alcohol rather than the aldehyde. The experiments also showed that the duration of the induction period, a key characteristic of chain reactions, is influenced by surface conditions and can be affected by the presence of moisture, ultra-violet radiation, and certain third substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
