It explores the impact of population growth, per capita cereal production, and the role of irrigation in rice production. The authors argue that increasing yields in existing irrigated areas and improving rain-fed areas can help reduce the demand for irrigation, while also considering the potential for irrigation development in Africa and Latin America.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Soil Management"}
