The author found that the ability of an insect to transmit the virus and the susceptibility of the plant to the virus play a significant role in the transmission process. The study also discusses the factors that determine the success or failure of virus transmission and the potential impact of plant susceptibility on the results of experimental trials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
