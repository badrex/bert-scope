The authors used a machine that applies direct alternating stress to a steel bar and measured the fall of temperature between the center and ends of the test piece to determine the rate of energy dissipation. The results show that the energy dissipated by hysteresis increases with the fourth power of the stress range, and there is no evidence of cumulative changes in the material's properties under the tested conditions."}
