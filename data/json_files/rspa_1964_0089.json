They investigate the conditions needed to produce tightly coiled spheres of amorphous polymers, which are suitable for quantitative analysis. This method provides a valuable alternative for determining molecular weights and their distribution in high molecular weight polymers, where conventional methods are unreliable.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
