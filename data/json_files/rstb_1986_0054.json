The system has two interconnected pathways, one frontal and one abfrontal, both arising and terminating in the primary vessels of the gills. The researchers used various techniques, including scanning electron microscopy and acrylic corrosion casts, to analyze the blood flow and circulation within the gills. The findings provide a better understanding of the gills' anatomy and blood circulation in eulamellibranch mollusks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Mollusca"}
