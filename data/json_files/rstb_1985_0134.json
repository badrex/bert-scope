The authors present a conceptual classification system for these deposits and analyze three examples from the Jurassic of southern Germany, focusing on the echinoderm Lagerst\u00e4tte of Gmund, which is an obrution deposit. The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors responsible for the formation of these unique fossil deposits and their significance in the study of paleobiology and paleoenvironments.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Sedimentology"}
