They found that the formation of these compounds leads to a significant decrease in electrical resistance in both principal directions. The research supports the theory that bromine abstracts electrons from the full-band of graphite, creating positive holes. The authors also determined the number of electrons transferred from the -band to the atoms of the adduct, providing insights into the nature of the bonding between bromine and graphite.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
