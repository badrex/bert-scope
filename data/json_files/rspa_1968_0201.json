They found that the ion composition is strongly controlled by geomagnetic latitude and showed a significant departure from hydrostatic equilibrium. The study also confirmed earlier findings of diurnal and seasonal variations in the ion composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ionosphere and Space Weather"}
