They found that the presence of incombustible gases, such as methyl bromide, narrows and ultimately extinguishes the limits of flammability of combustible gases in air. This research has implications for fire safety and the development of fire extinguishing techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
