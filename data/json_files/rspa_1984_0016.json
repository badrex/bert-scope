The authors use a renormalization group method to analyze the eigenvalue equation and provide a physical interpretation of Azbel's result. The study has implications for understanding electron behavior in one-dimensional solids with incommensurate structures and in models for energy bands of Bloch electrons in a magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
