The authors found that phase shifts in response to induced wheel-running and neuropeptide Y injections during the subjective day were greatly reduced by a subsequent light pulse. This suggests that light must act downstream from the release of neuropeptide Y into the suprachiasmatic nucleus to block activity-induced shifts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
