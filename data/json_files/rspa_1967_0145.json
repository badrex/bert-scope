The authors demonstrate that the absorption coefficients for radiation with its electric vector perpendicular to the symmetry axis are greater than those for parallel polarization. They also discuss the wavelength dependence of the absorption coefficients in the high-frequency region and the effects of anisotropy in the effective mass and relaxation time on the absorption. The results provide insights into the conduction bands in silicon carbide and help determine the effective mass and relaxation time in the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
