The authors extended the principal series of potassium and discovered new lines that do not correspond to known emission spectrum lines. They also discussed the implications of these findings on the understanding of series lines and the limits of the series. The authors used a metallic potassium vaporization method and a carbon arc as the light source to achieve accurate measures and observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
