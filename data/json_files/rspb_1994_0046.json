They used an anisotropic model for intra-fur flow and pressure distribution data from a solid cylinder to obtain more realistic velocity profiles within the fur. The results can be used to develop a comprehensive model of transport processes in animal or artificial fur and other porous media under various environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
