The author examines the influence of viscosity and hydromagnetic forces on the hydrodynamic motion produced by a small disturbance in the fluid's equilibrium. The study focuses on the effects of electrical conductivity, magnetic field strength, and fluid density on the behavior of hydromagnetic waves and the restoration of equilibrium in the fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
