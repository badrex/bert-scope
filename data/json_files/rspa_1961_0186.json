They derive equations that show how perigee distance, orbital period, and eccentricity vary with time. The influence of atmospheric oblateness is found to be significant, affecting the lifetime and air density at perigee. The study is important for understanding the behavior of satellites in orbit and for designing long-lasting satellite missions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Space Technology"}
