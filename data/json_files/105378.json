The meteor appeared as a bright, tennis ball-sized ball of fire with a train of four to five feet in length. It moved in an arc from the northwest to the southeast, and several sparks of blue fire issued from it before it disappeared. Mr. Colebrooke and other witnesses did not hear any noise or smell any sulfuric odor. This meteor was also seen by many people in the area and was widely discussed the following day.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
