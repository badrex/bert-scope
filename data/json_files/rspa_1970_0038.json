The technique does not require measuring fields but only determines the Q-factor of the resonator. By measuring the Q-factor with and without the obstacle in two different positions, the extinction cross-section can be deduced. This method provides absolute values of scattering cross-sections and is essential for understanding the attenuation of microwaves in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Microwave Engineering"}
