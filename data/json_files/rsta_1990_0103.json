The authors use numerical integrations and analytical methods to study the effects of cavitation, fluid inertia, and geometrical asymmetries on the motion of the rotor. They reveal a wide range of qualitative behavior and establish the foundations for further investigation using dynamical systems theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
