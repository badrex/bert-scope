They observed that the critical velocity, at which this change occurs, depends on the pipe's diameter and the fluid's viscosity. The findings help to understand the behavior of fluids in various applications, such as engineering and environmental sciences.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
