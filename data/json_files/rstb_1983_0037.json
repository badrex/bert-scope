It focuses on the pyruvate and branched-chain 2-oxoacid dehydrogenase complexes and their regulation through reversible phosphorylation. The article explains how these complexes play a role in glucose degradation, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and the interconversion of the branched-chain complex in response to supply.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
