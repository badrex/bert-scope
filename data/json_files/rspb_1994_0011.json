The results show that a functional endogenous serotonergic system is established in the spinal cord, which modulates the output of the central pattern generator for swimming. This system is different from that of closely related amphibian Xenopus laevis, which may explain differences in locomotor behavior between the two species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Developmental Biology"}
