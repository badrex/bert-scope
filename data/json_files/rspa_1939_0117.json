The authors study the effect of varying the chain length of the wax and the position of the polar group within the ester molecules. They find that the relaxation time increases with the length of the ester chain and becomes constant when the ester is longer than the paraffin molecule. The results are explained using Debye's equation and provide insights into the behavior of polar molecules in solid materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
