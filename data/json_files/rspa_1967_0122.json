They observed that as the wave amplitude increased, the pulse profile became asymmetric and the frequency distribution showed a distinct kink. The results agreed with Lighthill's prediction that the peak of a group on deep water would be preceded by components of increased wavenumber and followed by components of reduced wavenumber.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
