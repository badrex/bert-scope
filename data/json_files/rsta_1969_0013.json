They developed a technique for predicting atmospheric transmittance and compared their observed results with theoretical calculations. The study provides valuable data for understanding the Earth's atmosphere and improving the accuracy of atmospheric models.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
