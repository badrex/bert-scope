They use a Monte Carlo simulation to model sequence evolution under selection from the immune system and find that frequency dependent immune selection has a significant effect on viral sequence evolution. The study also discusses the use of drawing inferences about underlying evolutionary processes from samples of viral diversity in infected individuals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
