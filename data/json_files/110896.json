He explains how these elements grow and develop, and how this growth is different from the mode of growth described by Schwann. The author also believes that the same process of development and growth occurs in the epithelium, and provides evidence of similar arrangements in pigment cells and the skin of the negro.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
