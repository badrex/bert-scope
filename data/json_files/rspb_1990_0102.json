The research found that the relationship between growth rate and oxygen consumption in excess of maintenance is not linear, and an aerobic maximum for growth exists. The net efficiency of growth is affected by the level of metabolic power, with different efficiencies in each species. The findings provide insights into the energetics of growth in small poikilotherms and the role of energy allocation in their growth processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Aquatic Biology"}
