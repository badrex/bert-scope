They observed four periods and eight stages of the menstrual cycle, which involve changes in the uterus and blood supply. The author found that ovulation does not necessarily occur during each menstrual period, and menstruation is not caused by ovulation. The function of menstruation may be to prepare the uterus for the reception and retention of an ovum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
