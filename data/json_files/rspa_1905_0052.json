The authors found that the metals' tenacity is affected by the changes in phase, and the amorphous phase is harder than the crystalline phase. They also discovered that the metals' maximum tenacity can be achieved when they are in a homogeneous condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metal Properties"}
