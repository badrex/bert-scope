They measured the oxygen consumption and sodium efflux in frog sartorius muscles and found that about one-tenth of the energy from resting metabolism was used for active sodium extrusion. This study provides insights into muscle physiology and ion transport mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
