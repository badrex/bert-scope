They demonstrate that the conditions on the boundary values of fields at the internal infinity of the holes lead to a nonlinear overdetermined system of differential equations. The study simplifies the system using positivity of some differential operators and proves that for a broad class of Higgs potential functions and arbitrary gauge groups, the only solution is the abelian embedded Reissner-Nordstrom one.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
