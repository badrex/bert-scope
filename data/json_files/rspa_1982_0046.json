The study focuses on the effects of the force's direction and magnitude on the flow patterns and streamline behavior. The findings have applications in understanding fluid motion in various scenarios, such as insect flight and acoustic streaming.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
