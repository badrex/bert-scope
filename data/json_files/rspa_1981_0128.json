They find that using the Reynolds equation to correct for surface roughness can result in errors of up to 10% if the surface corrugations on the bearing plates are uncorrelated. Additionally, the Stokes solution indicates a positive load enhancement, while the Reynolds equation predicts a negative load enhancement that depends on the bearing length.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
