They found that arginase content varies significantly between species and that fish livers generally have lower arginase levels than mammalian livers. The study also revealed that arginase activity may be related to the zoological classification and the metabolism of animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
