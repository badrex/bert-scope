They consider the interaction between the third body and an ion to be of the Langevin form. The recombination coefficient is found to be, to a close approximation, equal to the sum of two partial recombination coefficients. Results are provided for a wide range of values, including temperature, masses of the involved species, and the polarizability of the third body.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
