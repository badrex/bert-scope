They used a sensitive Lippmann's capillary electrometer to detect the changes and found that the mammalian nerve showed a marked difference or demarcation current. The results provide insights into the relationship between the cortex and the spinal cord in the production of epileptic sequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
