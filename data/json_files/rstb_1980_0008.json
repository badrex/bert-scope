The polypeptide, with a molecular mass of around 11,000, is virus-specific and has a unique mRNA with an estimated size of 300-400 nucleotides. This finding expands our understanding of the structure and function of influenza viruses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
