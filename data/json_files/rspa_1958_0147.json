The authors calculate the variation of electron mobility with an increasing applied field and the collective dielectric breakdown field. They show that at high temperatures, a small increase in mobility occurs, while at low temperatures, a large decrease in mobility is observed. The authors also discuss the application of these results to semiconductors, with a focus on indium antimonide.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
