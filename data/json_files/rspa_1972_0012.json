They found that chabazite and active carbon were the most efficient sorbents for reducing rare gas pressures in high-temperature, high-pressure systems. The study provides insights into the sorption mechanisms and the role of intracrystalline electrostatic fields in the sorption process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
