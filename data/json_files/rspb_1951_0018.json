The authors found that these ions help protect bacterial cells from the adverse effects of low pH by interacting with enzyme systems and allowing cells to consume oxygen and break down nutrients more efficiently. The presence of alkali-metal ions is essential for cell viability and growth, and their accumulation is associated with the oxidation of carbon substrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
