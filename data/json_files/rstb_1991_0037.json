It highlights the challenges in measuring genetic correlations and the potential for complementary approaches using genetic and physiological methods. The author also emphasizes the need for a better understanding of development rate and senescence, as well as the importance of the comparative method in testing evolutionary theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
