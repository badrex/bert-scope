The authors introduce a communal activation energy and dimensionless parameters to describe the system's behavior. They explore a pair of concurrent, exothermic reactions and discuss the conditions for instability and criticality. The study also covers various aspects of heat transfer, activation energies, and the effects of different geometries on distributed temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
