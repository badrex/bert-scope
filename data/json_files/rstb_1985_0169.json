It explains how carbon tetrachloride is metabolically activated in the liver endoplasmic reticulum, producing reactive intermediates, including the trichloromethyl free radical. The article also highlights the importance of lipid peroxidation in the liver damage caused by carbon tetrachloride and its relevance to tissue injury.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Toxicology"}
