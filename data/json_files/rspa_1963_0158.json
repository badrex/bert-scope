They found that neither saturation nor quadratic variation with field was observed in any orientation. The anisotropy of magneto-resistance was small but showed a consistent pattern. The results could not be explained by Harrison's four orthogonal plane wave model of the aluminium Fermi surface but could be explained by a slightly different Fermi surface model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
