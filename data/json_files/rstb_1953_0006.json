The shell's triangular outline and posterior extension of the mantle provide protection and allow for frequent repair of damage. The author discusses the species' unique features, such as waste canals, pallial organ, and pallial retractors, which contribute to their success in their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Bivalvia"}
