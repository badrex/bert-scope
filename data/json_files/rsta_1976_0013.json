The authors estimate that the shortening across the belt is not more than 8 km or 14% and suggest that the main deformation episode, F2, has a controlling influence on the orientation of the strain ellipsoid. This research provides insights into the tectonic history and evolution of the Zambezi Belt during the Proterozoic time interval.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
