They discovered that by stimulating specific regions of the cerebral cortex, they could control the respiratory movements of the animals. The study aimed to understand the representation of respiration in the highest nerve centers and the relationship between cerebral excitation and respiratory changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain Stimulation"}
