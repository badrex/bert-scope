The author explains the role of the \"rounding\" and \"twisting\" in boomerang design and describes the flight path, which involves a loop and a gradual descent. The article provides a mathematical analysis of the forces acting on the boomerang during its flight, considering the air resistance and the boomerang's shape.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
