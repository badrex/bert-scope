Brodie, discovered a new group of chemical substances called peroxides of the radicals of organic acids. He established the generality of the fundamental reaction by which these bodies are prepared and discussed the preparation of peroxide of barium, which can be used as an instrument of chemical research. Brodie also mentioned the preparation and properties of peroxide of benzoyl, a member of a new class of chemical substances fundamentally different from the peroxides of monobasic acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
