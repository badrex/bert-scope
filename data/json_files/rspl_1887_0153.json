They argue that cranial nerves follow a similar plan to spinal nerves, with anterior and posterior roots and root ganglia. The study focuses on the oculomotor, trochlear, and abducens nerves, analyzing their structure and the location of their root ganglia. The author suggests that these nerves conform to the type of spinal nerves, providing insights into the evolution and function of the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
