They examine the methods used to determine the transport numbers of ions and the factors affecting these numbers. The study confirms that only simple salts, like alkali metal chlorides and nitrates, have transport numbers independent of concentration. The authors also explore the importance of understanding the movement of ions during electrolysis for a better understanding of salt solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
