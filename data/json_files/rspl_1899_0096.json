The author uses a simple differential relation to expand the coefficients of correlation and create a symbolic operator that converts an uncorrelated surface of frequency into a correlated surface with coefficients of arbitrary values. The author also introduces new functions called \"-functions\" that satisfy a difference equation and can be used to calculate the volume of a frequency surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
