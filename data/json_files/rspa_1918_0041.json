The authors use a crystal to analyze a beam of X-rays and obtain homogeneous rays. They find that the log-absorption curve is a straight line when higher-order waves are eliminated. The results show that the absorption coefficient ratio is approximately independent of the wave-length, and a break occurs in the curve at a specific wave-length. The authors also observe discontinuities in both copper and aluminium curves at certain wave-lengths."}
