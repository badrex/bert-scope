The author derives the stability equation from the theory of thin shells and provides a numerical discussion of the stability of the plate under shearing forces. The study predicts the number of lobes in the distorted configuration based on the ratio of the outer to the inner radius of the plate.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
