The observations were made to determine the accuracy and reliability of the instruments and to establish a base for magnetic surveys in France and England. The results showed that the instruments agreed closely with each other, and the findings can be used to improve future magnetic surveys and instrument comparisons.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
