The author explains the process of removing tidal elevations from direct measurements and highlights the limitations and requirements for accurate results. The study emphasizes the importance of combining altimetry with other data sources, such as surface pressure and geoid height, to improve understanding of ocean dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
