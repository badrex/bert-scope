It maintains precursors of exported proteins in an unfolded state, preventing them from aggregating or folding into their stable state in the cytoplasm. SecB recognizes completed precursors of soluble proteins by their slow folding property and delivers them to SecA, a component of the export apparatus. This process ensures that proteins remain unfolded to cross membranes effectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
