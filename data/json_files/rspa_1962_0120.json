They identified three main crystalline components: 4-dalbergioidin, homoferreirin, and ougenin. These compounds have different chemical structures and properties, and their presence in the heartwood contributes to the tree's durability and use in making furniture.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
