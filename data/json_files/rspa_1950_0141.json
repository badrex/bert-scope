They determined the monomer reactivity ratios and found that styrene radicals react with butyl acrylate radicals more quickly than the mean rate of reaction of styrene to styrene and butyl acrylate to butyl acrylate radicals. The coefficient defining this increased activity is not constant and increases with the styrene content.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
