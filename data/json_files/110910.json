The method involves measuring the nitrogen gas released during decomposition, which can be used to estimate the quantity of ammonia in the solution. The author also discusses the use of chloride of lime for analyzing organic substances, hydrocyanic acid, and salts of cyanogen. Additionally, he explores the potential use of hypochlorites for dissolving uric acid and chloride of lime for estimating nitrogen in urine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
