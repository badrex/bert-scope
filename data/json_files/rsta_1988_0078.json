They describe the three stages of tectonic evolution, including the assembly of continental and arc terranes during the Mesozoic and early Tertiary, the collision between India and the amalgamated Asian Block, and the post-collisional northward indentation of India. The study discusses various tectonic zones and their mutual relations, focusing on the Tibetan Plateau, the Trans-Himalayan magmatic belt, and the Indus-Yarlung Zangbo Suture Zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
