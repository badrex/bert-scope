They argue that none of the existing models are consistent with all the features of collagen, and propose a new model based on planar trans amide groups. This model accounts for the 2-86A meridional spacing and the 1-75 perpendicular dichroism observed in the N-H stretching frequency. The authors emphasize the need for further research on collagen proteins, including biochemical analysis and investigation of the effects of salts and large molecules on their precipitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
