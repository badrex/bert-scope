They analyze the resin's reaction to heat and its interaction with alcohol, discovering that it undergoes chemical changes when heated. The author also compares the resin's composition to other resins and discusses its potential applications, such as combining with lead oxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
