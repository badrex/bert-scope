They fuse the alloy with a small proportion of sodium monosulphide and stir the mixture to eliminate copper traces. This process allows for the production of pure bismuth suitable for industrial use. The authors also study the effects of magnetism and polarization in light on the separation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
