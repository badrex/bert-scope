The authors used a new method to measure specific heat and magnetization simultaneously, enabling them to directly measure specific heat over small temperature intervals. The results provide a better understanding of the relationship between magnetic properties and heat treatment in ferromagnetic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Properties"}
