The observations were challenging due to the presence of meteor and auroral echoes, but the team successfully confirmed radar echoes from the satellites and calculated their effective scattering cross-sections. The study highlights the difficulties in locating the targets and the importance of understanding confusing factors like meteor echoes and aurorae in space exploration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
