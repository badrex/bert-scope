The author explores the growth rates and responses of these algae to changes in their environment, suggesting that they could be used to monitor pollution levels in seawater. The study focuses on the advantages of using attached algae, which draw nutrients directly from their surroundings, making them ideal for observing pollution effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
