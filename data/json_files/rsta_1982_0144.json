It describes the isolation and structural characterization of thermally stable, hydrocarbon-soluble organocopper compounds containing aryl, alkenyl, and alkynyl ligands. The article also explores the dynamic behavior of organo ligands in arylcopper clusters and specific carbon-carbon bond formation reactions occurring at the surface of organocopper clusters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
