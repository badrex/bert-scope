The endothelium produces prostacyclin, a potent inhibitor of platelet aggregation and adhesion, which plays a significant role in the interaction between platelets and the blood vessel wall. The study also highlights the importance of prostacyclin in preventing platelet adherence to the endothelium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Physiology"}
