The authors measure the errors in angle measurements due to camera errors, distortion from the chamber, and subsequent nuclear collisions. They find that the average error in angle determination is around 13 minutes of arc, which is higher than previous estimates due to the selection of tracks for measurement. The authors also analyze the errors in angle measurements for different types of particle collisions and discuss the implications for determining energy levels and conservation in nuclear disintegration collisions."}
