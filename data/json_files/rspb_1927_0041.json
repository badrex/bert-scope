They discovered that the liver's portal lymphatics are defined by these compounds, providing a way to visualize and understand the structure and arrangement of lymphatic systems. This method can be applied to other organs as well, offering insights into the distribution of lymphatics and their role in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
