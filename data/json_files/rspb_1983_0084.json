The major ion carrying this current is calcium, and the peak amplitude of Isi is larger and the kinetics more rapid than previous studies in multicellular cardiac preparations. The results support the hypothesis that Isi is activated by depolarization and that calcium is the major charge carrier for this current.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
