They found that the ignition delay times were influenced by particle size and the volatile content of the coal. The experimental results suggest that the ignition process is a surface-catalyzed process, and a mechanism is proposed to explain the ignition delays based on particle heating by conduction and chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Combustion and Energy Technologies"}
