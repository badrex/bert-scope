The author presents a model calculation for the quadratic Zeeman effect and evaluates the electric quadrupole splitting for integral and half-integral values of the system. The article also explores the enhanced nuclear magnetic hyperfine structure and the behavior of the electron spin resonance and nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
