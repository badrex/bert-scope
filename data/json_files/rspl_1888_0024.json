They discovered that the vagus nerve influences the heart's action by causing a slowing or stopping of the heart rate, weakening the contraction force, and depressing the excitability of the auricular tissue. The study also found that the vagus nerve has a direct impact on the contractile tissue of the heart, and its effects on the ventricles are similar to those observed in cold-blooded animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
