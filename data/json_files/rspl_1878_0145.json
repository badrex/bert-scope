They compare the pelvis of Ornithorhynchus with that of a lizard and a turtle, highlighting the distinct features of each. The study reveals that while there are similarities between mammalian and reptilian pelvis structures, there are also significant differences that can inform our understanding of mammalian evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
