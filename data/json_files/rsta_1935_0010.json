The authors describe experiments on kinetic friction, dividing it into three categories: no lubrication, boundary lubrication, and fluid lubrication. They discuss the influence of load, area of contact, velocity, and surface hardness on the coefficient of kinetic friction and explore the transition from fluid lubrication to boundary lubrication for various lubricants and surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
