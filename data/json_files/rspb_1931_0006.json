The research focuses on the formation and growth of oocytes, the role of cell structures like the nucleolus, yolk nucleus, and Golgi bodies, and the distribution of mitochondria in the oocytes. The findings provide a better understanding of echinoderm oogenesis and the development of their eggs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
