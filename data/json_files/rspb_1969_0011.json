It observes the accumulation of organelles, such as mitochondria and myelin figures, immediately distal to the constriction. The research also notes the absence of granular vesicles and a decrease in axonal endoplasmic reticulum, suggesting a differential movement of axoplasm and organelles in response to injury.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
