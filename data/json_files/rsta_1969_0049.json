The method uses micrometeorological methods and considers factors like wind velocity, cloudiness, and source height to determine the diffusion of noxious gases. The authors propose a scheme that can be programmed for a computer to calculate maximum surface concentrations and their distances from the source, allowing authorities to make informed decisions on air pollution measures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Air Pollution and Meteorology"}
