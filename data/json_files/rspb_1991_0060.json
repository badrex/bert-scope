The study found that these sequences fall into two subfamilies, suggesting that the avian and mammalian SRY-type sequences share a common ancestor. The results also showed that Y-chromosome-linked SRY genes have evolved at a faster rate than autosomal SRY-box genes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
