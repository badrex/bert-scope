The research aims to provide a better understanding of the forces involved in fluid dynamics and their impact on structures like bridges and buildings. The findings can help engineers design more stable structures and improve our understanding of fluid-induced vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
