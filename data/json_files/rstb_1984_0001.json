The researchers reared the crabs from eggs to the fifth crab instar and described the fourth zoeal stage and megalopa for two species. They found that early crab stages have similar carapace morphology but show differences in mouthpart setation and fifth pereopod spination. The study suggests that early crab stages may be more useful in understanding brachyuran phylogenies than zoeal stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology"}
