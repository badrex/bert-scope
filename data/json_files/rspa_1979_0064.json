The author reviews various mechanisms for -ray production, including thermal and non-thermal processes, and considers the limitations imposed by current and future observations on these theories. The article also explores the role of gas clouds and relativistic electrons in the emission mechanisms of active galactic nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
