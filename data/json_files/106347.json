The author, Dr. Musgrave, disagrees with the findings of Dr. Franklin and Mr. Nairne, arguing that the universality of sharp points in preventing electrical explosions is not proven. He explains that the explosion depends on the quantity of electric fluid accumulated and the type of conductor used, challenging the validity of some experiments conducted by Mr. Nairne.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
