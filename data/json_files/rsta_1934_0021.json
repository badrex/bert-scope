They develop a general method to determine the distribution of surface potential for various electrode arrangements, which can be useful in geophysical prospecting. The study also explores the use of Sturm-Liouville expansions and boundary conditions to understand the behavior of electric currents in different media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
