They found that an increase in carbonic acid in the blood promotes coagulation, while a decrease in oxygen has a retarding effect on coagulation. This research helps to understand the role of carbonic acid and oxygen in blood coagulation and intravascular coagulation in specific vascular areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
