Crystals", "semantic_tags": ["Crystal Mechanics", "Plastic Spin", "Multiple Slip Configurations", "Finite Deformation of Crystals", "f.c.c. Crystals"], "tldr": "The authors propose a theory of minimum plastic spin for the finite deformation of crystals, focusing on f.c.c. crystals. They investigate three families of multiple-slip configurations and demonstrate that minimum plastic spin uniquely predicts the experimentally observed behavior in each case. This theory helps resolve non-uniqueness problems in uniform deformation of crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
