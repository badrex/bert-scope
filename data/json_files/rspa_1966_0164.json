They used electromagnetic suspension and induction to suspend and spin the sphere, and measured the drag torque through the transition regime from continuum to free molecule flow. The results showed an unexpected Mach number dependence in the transition regime, and the authors discussed a simple physical model to explain the drag variation."}
