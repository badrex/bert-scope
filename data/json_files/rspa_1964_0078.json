They discovered a new spectrum of the SO radical and found the dissociation energy for SO to be 127 kcal/mol. The study also revealed a new transient spectrum in the hydrogen sulfide and carbon disulfide reactions, which helped in understanding the reaction mechanisms for the combustion of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
