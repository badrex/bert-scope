They found that glucose enters the photosynthetic carbon reduction cycle and leads to increased glycollic acid formation under certain conditions. The addition of isonicotinyl hydrazide (INH) stimulates glycollic acid and glycine production, but does not significantly affect the distribution of 14C between the carbon atoms of the glucose units.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis and Plant Physiology"}
