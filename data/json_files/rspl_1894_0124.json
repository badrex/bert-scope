The authors conclude that these roots have characteristics similar to those of modern vascular plants, including a well-marked medulla, primary xylem-strands, and endogenous branching. The study provides insights into the anatomy and development of these ancient plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
