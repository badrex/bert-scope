They use the triple-deck theory to analyze the interaction region and provide insights into the flow structure when the blowing velocity is high. This research helps in understanding the effects of strong slot injection and can be applied to plate injection as well.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
