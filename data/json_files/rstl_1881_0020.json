They found that different molecular groupings in organic bodies affect their absorption in the infra-red region, and that these groupings can be identified by analyzing the absorption spectra. This research helps in understanding the behavior of organic compounds and their interactions with light.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
