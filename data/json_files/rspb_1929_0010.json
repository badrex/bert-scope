The research shows that the stretch reflex is an extensor reflex that is resistant to fatigue. The authors analyze the muscle's response to stretch and release, discovering that it behaves as an inelastic body initially and then as an elastic body. They conclude that the \"stationary rigidity\" is a property of the muscle fiber and is not affected by sympathetic or dorsal root connections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
