The authors find that the adsorption behavior is influenced by the arrangement of metal atoms and the attractive interactions between the gas molecules and the metal surface. The results provide insights into the adsorption mechanisms and potential applications of metal films in gas separation and sensing.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
