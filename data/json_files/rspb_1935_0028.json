It classifies them into two broad groups based on their feeding habits: those that feed largely by taste and those that feed mainly by sight. The research examines the structural variations in the hind brain of these fishes and their relationship to their feeding habits, providing insights into their anatomy and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
