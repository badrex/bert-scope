The results show that X-ray exposure causes changes in chromosome behavior, leading to abnormal anaphase separation and fusion of chromosomes. This indicates that X-rays can have detrimental effects on meiosis and potentially affect the fertility of the organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
