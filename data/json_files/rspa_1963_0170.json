They found that there is a third term in the turbidity formula that depends on the excess polarizability of the solute and the polarizability of the solvent. This correction is important for solutions of small molecules and can alter estimates of molecular weights from turbidity by more than a few tens of molecular weight units. The corrected formula may help investigate the dependence of the isothermal compressibility of solutions on the concentration of solute.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
