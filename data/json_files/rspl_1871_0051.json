They found that phosphonium iodide can be decomposed by alcohols, leading to the formation of primary and secondary phosphines. The author also studied the properties of these phosphines, including their solubility in water and alcohol, and their reactivity with oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
