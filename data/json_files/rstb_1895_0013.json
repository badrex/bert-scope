The author found that temperature during fertilization has a significant effect on the size of the larvae, with optimal development occurring at around 17.5 to 21.5 degrees Celsius. The research also shows that temperature variations during development can influence the size and shape of the larvae, highlighting the importance of environmental conditions on the growth of organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Developmental Biology"}
