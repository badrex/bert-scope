They propose a crystallographic interpretation of spicule formation and deformation, suggesting that the triradiate spicule is a skeleton of a hexagonal prism region enclosed by two surfaces that limit the formation of material. This study provides a deeper understanding of sponge biology and the role of spicules in their structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Sponge Biology"}
