The author discusses the impact of the image force on carrier distribution and establishes a general relation between diffusion and diode theory. The article also compares the experimental results with the theoretical predictions for both Mott and Schottky barriers, providing insights into the physical constants of rectifiers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Semiconductor physics"}
