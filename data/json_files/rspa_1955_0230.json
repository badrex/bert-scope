They find that these waves exist in certain symmetrical cases and demonstrate their properties, such as the motion of particles in a plane inclined to the direction of propagation. The study has implications for understanding seismic waves and the behavior of elastic media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
