{"article_id": "106737", "revised_title": "Correcting Newton's Error on the Precession of the Equinoxes", "semantic_tags": ["Celestial mechanics", "Astronomy", "Newtonian mechanics", "Equinoxes", "Precession"], "tldr": "The author, Samuel Vince, revisits Sir Isaac Newton's theory on the precession of the equinoxes and corrects an error in Newton's calculations. Vince provides a new solution based on Newton's principles, which simplifies the calculation and offers a more accurate estimation of the precession. The author acknowledges that the estimation remains uncertain due to potential inaccuracies in observations and the complexity of the Earth's density.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
