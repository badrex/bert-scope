The model describes the meson fields in terms of collective motions and interactions with the nucleon field. The masses and coupling constants of the mesons are determined by a universal coupling constant and a cut-off. The model also suggests a natural way to introduce the'spurion' for weak interactions that violate strangeness.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
