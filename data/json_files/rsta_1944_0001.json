It develops a technique for constructing concomitants using tensors and group theory, providing a foundation for understanding geometric configurations and their properties. The author also applies this theory to classical problems in invariant theory, such as generating functions and sets of concomitants.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
