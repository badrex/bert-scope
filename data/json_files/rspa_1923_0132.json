The author develops a theory of optical opacity and applies it to various scenarios, including puff of smoke, smoke-cloud produced continuously at a fixed point, and smoke-cloud produced continuously along a straight line perpendicular to the wind direction. The study also extends the results to non-isotropic cases and discusses the implications of the findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
