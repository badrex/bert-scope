They find that cytoplasmic inheritance is crucial for understanding the differentiation and maintenance of cell states, and that amoebae are a useful model for studying these processes. The study also highlights the importance of measuring various characteristics, both physiological and macromolecular, to better understand the inheritance patterns in these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
