The authors find that the correlation between size and abundance within bird tribes is positively correlated with the degree of taxonomic isolation of the tribe. This relation holds within bird tribes in both wintering assemblages, and evidence for this relation is found using two different measures of bird abundance. The authors propose two possible mechanisms that could produce these patterns, although they acknowledge the unlikely nature of such an effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
