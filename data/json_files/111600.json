By dividing specific parts of the sympathetic nervous system, the author discovered that the superior cervical ganglion causes the most rapid and strong diabetic effect. This research provides insights into the complex relationship between the nervous system and diabetes.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
