The Semenov model is analyzed, and explicit relations are derived for the dependence of the critical Semenov number on the Rayleigh number. The study shows that natural convection can affect the critical conditions for spontaneous self-ignition in reacting systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
