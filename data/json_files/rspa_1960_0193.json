They observed changes in the work function and photoelectric yield during the oxidation of nickel films and the reduction of nickel oxide with hydrogen. The findings support the accepted generalized model for oxidation and reduction processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
