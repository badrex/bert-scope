These pigments were mostly found in plants from certain families, providing evidence for the relationships between plant groups. The study supports the idea that nitrogenous anthocyanins may be important in tracing plant relationships and confirms previous generalizations about plant families and their pigments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
