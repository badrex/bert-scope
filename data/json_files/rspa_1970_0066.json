They used the spin Hamiltonian to calculate the energy levels and found that the measured value of the nuclear electric quadrupole interaction was considerably smaller than predicted values. This discovery led to a better understanding of the crystal field in calcium fluoride.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
