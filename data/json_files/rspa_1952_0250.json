They discovered that strong adhesion occurs between the surfaces, and shearing occurs within the bulk of the plastic rather than at the interface. This suggests that the mechanism of friction for plastics is similar to that proposed for metals. An exception to these findings is polytetrafluorethylene, which has a different frictional behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
