He found that a ten-feet reflector can show the real or spurious discs of objects when their diameter is one-fourth of a second, and in favorable conditions, this diameter can be divided into two or three parts. The study has implications for improving the criteria for observing celestial objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Telescope Design and Resolution"}
