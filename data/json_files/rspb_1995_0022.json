The research also shows that the so-called \"bisexual\" populations of L. lugubris are actually cryptic sexual species, and that the two parental species are not sister taxa. This discovery challenges the assumption that asexual species must arise through hybridization of two sexual species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
