The author compares the mean temperature of the water to that of the air and discusses the factors affecting the temperature changes. The study reveals that the mean temperature of the water is higher than the air temperature, with the greatest difference occurring in October and the least in February. The author concludes that the water at Greenwich is not significantly affected by the tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
