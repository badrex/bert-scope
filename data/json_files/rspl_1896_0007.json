Norman Lockyer, reports and discusses observations made during the total solar eclipse of April 16, 1893. The study focused on the sun's atmosphere, including the chromosphere and corona, using spectroscopy and photography. The author presents findings on the intensity and wavelengths of various spectral lines, the chemical composition of the chromosphere and prominences, and the possible variations in the corona. The research also investigates the origin of the solar atmosphere and the role of chemical substances at high temperatures."}
