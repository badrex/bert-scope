He describes a new instrument called the \"Araeometer\" for measuring the volume of liquids and discusses the variations in weight due to changes in weather. He also provides a method to determine the quantity of salt contained in a given volume of acid spirit by comparing it with a known acid spirit.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-base chemistry"}
