The authors develop a field theory with a Lagrangian that depends on the field quantities and their derivatives, without introducing potentials. They show that this approach is equivalent to traditional electrodynamics and can include Dirac's new electrodynamics and Proca equations for a vector meson field as special cases. The authors also discuss the potential implications for quantum theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
