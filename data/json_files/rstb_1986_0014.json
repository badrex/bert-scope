The fossils provide insights into the evolution of the 'living fossil' Sphenodon, challenging the idea that it is more archaic than previously thought. The study highlights the unique features of Diphydontosaurus, such as its pleurodont and acrodont teeth, and its position within the Sphenodontidae family.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
