They investigated the osmotic pressure and conductivity of these dyes, finding that the conductivities were high, suggesting a highly dissociated or completely dissociated electrolyte. However, the osmotic pressure was close to the pressure calculated from the molecular weight, indicating that the dye existed in solution as single undissociated molecules. The authors discussed various explanations for this anomaly, including the existence of micelles and the role of interionic attraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloid Chemistry"}
