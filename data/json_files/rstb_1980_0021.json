The authors highlight the role of avian influenza viruses in the origin of some human pandemic strains and the adaptation of avian viruses to mammalian hosts. They also touch upon the molecular basis of host range and virulence, emphasizing the need for further research on gene requirements for inter-species transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
