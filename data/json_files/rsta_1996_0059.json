This new model, based on nebular processes, provides a better explanation for the refractory lithophile element abundances in the Earth's upper mantle and challenges previous assumptions about the formation of the Earth and its relationship to chondrites.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
