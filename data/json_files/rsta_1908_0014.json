They analyze the equations and methods used to compute the harmonics and stability of the figure, concluding that the pear-shaped figure is unstable. The author also discusses the differences between their findings and those of M. Lapounoff, another mathematician who reached an opposite conclusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
