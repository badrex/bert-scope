The boy's humeral artery was likely damaged, but no immediate bleeding occurred. The patient was closely monitored, and various treatments were attempted, including bloodletting and the application of warm poultices. Despite these efforts, the patient eventually died, and an autopsy revealed a perforation in the artery. The cause of the boy's death and the lack of immediate bleeding from the artery remain unexplained.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Surgery"}
