They discuss the concept of asyzygetic integrals and irreducible integrals, and their relationship to the number and form of covariants and invariants. The author also explains the process of deriving the number of irreducible integrals of a given degree and the role of partial differential equations in this context.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
