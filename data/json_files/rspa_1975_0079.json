They found significant differences in the isotope shifts for various lines, with field-shifts and specific mass-shifts varying between different lines. The results provide insights into the behavior of atomic spectra and help improve the understanding of atomic structure and interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
