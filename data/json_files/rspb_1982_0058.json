It shows that European hydra digestive cells do not transport all native algae to the base, and a high percentage remain at the apex and disintegrate. The research also demonstrates that recognition of suitable algae is not based on a single algal character and depends on various algal properties and interactions within the host cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
