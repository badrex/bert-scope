The authors found that transcriptionally active chromatin does not contain nucleosomal structures and suggested that structural changes from nucleosomal packing to an extended form of DNA are involved in the transcriptional activation of chromatin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
