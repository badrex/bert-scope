The authors discuss the factors affecting reproducibility, such as metallic impurities, convection currents, and temperature changes. They also explain the role of oxygen control and ion control in the corrosion process and the importance of maintaining consistent experimental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
