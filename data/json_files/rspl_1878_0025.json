They discovered that magnetizing iron and steel longitudinally decreases the flow of heat by about 1%, while magnetizing it transversely increases the flow of heat by about 1%. This research provides insights into the relationship between magnetism and heat transfer in materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
