They found that the nuclear polarization produced by microwave power varies with the concentration of the radical and the presence of oxygen or paramagnetic ions. This research can provide information about intermolecular forces and improve signal-to-noise ratios in nuclear resonances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)"}
