They found that the energy transfer from singlet states of nitrogen to CO is an efficient process, and the excited triplet states of nitrogen contribute to the emission of triplet states of CO but not significantly to singlet CO emission.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
