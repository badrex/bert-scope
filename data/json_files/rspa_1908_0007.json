The author presents a new characteristic curve that helps deduce the trajectory of a projectile and compares range tables to demonstrate the effectiveness of these laws. The article also highlights the benefits of using this gunsight in military applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Military Science"}
