These fossils represent three new genera of woody angiosperms with preserved anatomy, which are contemporaneous with Bennettites. Their significance lies in being the first angiosperms described from this early horizon in Northern Europe and the oldest angiosperms with known anatomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
