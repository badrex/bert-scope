The authors explore various aspects of high-pressure biology, including molecular, cellular, and membrane effects, and how they relate to the high-pressure nervous syndrome in humans. They also examine the role of pressure and temperature in physiological research and the potential for pressure as a unique research tool.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
