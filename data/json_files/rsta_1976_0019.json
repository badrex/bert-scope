The authors argue that applying plate tectonic theories to well-preserved and exposed areas can provide valuable insights into the evolution of these belts. They also caution against relying on a single category of geological data, such as radiometric age dating, which can lead to misleading paradigms like the \"Pan-African Orogeny\" and the concept of a Proterozoic supercontinent.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
