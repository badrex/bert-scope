They found that the composition of the hydrogen gas evolved is determined by the equilibrium between heavy and light hydrogen atoms in the water. This equilibrium plays a significant role in the preferential liberation of light hydrogen in separation methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
