It discusses various conditions that can exist based on the relative magnitudes of the mean free path and range of order in the liquid. The author presents a detailed analysis of the energy-momentum curves and resistance for different scenarios, from complete disorder to polycrystalline order.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
