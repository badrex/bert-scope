The research develops a new theory for these orbits in an atmosphere where air density varies linearly with height, providing a better understanding of the real atmosphere and improving the interpretation of measurements of geophysical parameters from orbital changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
