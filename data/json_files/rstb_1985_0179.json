They discover that the embryo is divided into compartments and parasegments, rather than segments, and that parasegments are more fundamental units of insect design. This new understanding of embryonic development challenges traditional concepts and provides a more objective picture of the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
