They compared their findings with Hartree-Fock calculations to provide a detailed interpretation of the observed spectrum. The strong doublet lines in the spectrum were found to be broad, with autoionization broadening being a major contributor to their widths.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
