They found that the resistance first appeared when the applied field exceeded half the critical field. The results were used to determine the surface energy at the boundary between superconducting and normal phases, which is responsible for the resistance being greater than 1. The investigation covered a wide range of cylinder diameters and materials, including tin and mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
