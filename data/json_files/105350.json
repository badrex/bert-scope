They tested various colors and methods, including using acids and heat, to understand how the colors penetrate the marble and how they can be preserved. The authors found that the colors remain unaffected by acids but are discharged by calcination, suggesting that the method used by Chambers is effective for coloring marble.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
