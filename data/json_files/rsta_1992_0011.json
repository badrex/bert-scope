The authors develop a fundamentally different method using channel multipoles to predict the far-field behavior and solve various problems involving circular cylinders in channels. They consider radiation and scattering problems, including cylinders occupying the whole depth of fluid and those with truncated cylinders.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
