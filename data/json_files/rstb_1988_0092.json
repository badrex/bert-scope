The study focuses on specimens from southwest Britain and provides insights into the taxonomy and morphology of this ancient reptile. Clevosaurus is found to have distinct characteristics that separate it from other lepidosauromorphs, making its position within the Sphenodontida unclear. The author suggests that Clevosaurus may share certain characteristics with other sphenodontid genera, forming a possible monophyletic assemblage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Paleontology"}
