The author, J. Norman Lockyer, uses electrolytically deposited iron to create a more accurate and pure spectrum for comparison. The study is important for solar and stellar work, as it helps establish a reliable comparison for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
