They discover that coal-tar and paraffin oil, products of industrial and domestic fires, coat the water droplets and form an oily film that retards evaporation, leading to the formation of dry fog. This research also explains the frequency, persistence, and irritating nature of fogs in large towns, as some products of coal combustion are irritating to the respiratory system and have low volatility at normal temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
