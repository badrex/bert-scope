They discuss the role of the polar vortex in maintaining the ozone amount within its core and the influence of planetary waves on the breakdown of the vortex. The study also highlights the chemical reactions contributing to ozone depletion and the importance of solar control in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
