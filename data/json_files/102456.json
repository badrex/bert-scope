The causeway is made up of irregularly shaped stones, mostly pentagonal and hexagonal, standing close together. The stones are composed of several joints or pieces, and their smooth sides and surfaces suggest they were formed by natural processes. The causeway's irregular shape and the estimated number of pillars make it a fascinating geological curiosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
