Tennant found that diamonds are composed entirely of charcoal and are part of the class of inflammable bodies. He confirmed this by exposing diamonds to heated nitre and measuring the amount of fixed air produced, which is similar to the amount produced by an equal weight of charcoal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
