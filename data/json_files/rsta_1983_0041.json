They emphasize the importance of integrating satellite imagery with other techniques in mineral exploration and terrain analysis. The authors also highlight the potential of multispectral satellite imagery in identifying geological structures, lithologies, and geothermal activity. They provide examples of successful applications of satellite imagery in different environments, including arid and humid lands, and stress the need for ground truth data and field investigations for effective interpretation of the imagery.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Geophysics"}
