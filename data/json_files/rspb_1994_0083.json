The authors found that young birds contribute less to incubation in larger groups, while older birds maintain their contribution regardless of group size. Additionally, young birds lose mass in proportion to the amount of incubation they perform, suggesting direct costs of helping behavior. These findings suggest that helping is not inevitable and may be influenced by both the needs of the dominants and the direct costs of helping.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
