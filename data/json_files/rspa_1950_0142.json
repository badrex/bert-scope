They found evidence for folded chains with a repeat distance of about 5.1 \u00c5, containing three amino acid residues per repeat. This research provided insights into the structure of proteins and laid the foundation for further studies on protein folding and structure determination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure"}
