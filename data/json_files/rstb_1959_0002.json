They collected samples from various localities and measured the height, diameter, and component plates of the specimens. The author found that there is considerable variation in size due to the samples consisting of individuals at different stages of growth. They used biometrical methods to analyze the data and found that growth is isometric for some pairs of variates, while in other cases, there are significant changes in shape during the young stages. The study provides insights into the evolution of the genus Orbitremites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
