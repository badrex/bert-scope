They found that muscle contraction and stretching involve changes in internal energy and entropy, which can be related to the molecular structure and arrangement of muscle fibers. The results suggest that muscle fibers are made up of chain molecules with strong bonds in one direction and more fluid-like properties in others, leading to a unique rubber-like state.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
