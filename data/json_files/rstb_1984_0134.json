The authors suggest that the sperm aster determines the direction of rotation of the cortex, which activates latent dorsalizing-axializing agents in the vegetal hemisphere. This process plays a crucial role in determining the regional differences in the embryo, including the position of the blastopore and the formation of ectodermal and endodermal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
