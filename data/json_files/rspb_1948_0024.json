The authors demonstrate that the cochlea's resonant elements have selectivity proportional to frequency, supporting the resonance hypothesis of Helmholtz. They also discuss different types of peripheral transformations and their evolutionary significance in various animals, emphasizing the importance of frequency analysis in mammalian ears.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
