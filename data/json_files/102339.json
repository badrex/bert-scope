He recommends Vicia multiflora nemorensis for its ability to spread widely and provide a dense cover, and also suggests using blue-brown clay for manuring sandy soil. Lister also touches on the potential of other plants, such as the white briony, for hay and corn production, and shares his thoughts on improving the palatability of certain plants for livestock.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture"}
