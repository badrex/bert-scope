He observed that the explosion of gunpowder in a vacuum created a pressure change, which could be measured using a mercury barometer. The experiment also showed the potential dangers of storing gunpowder in a vacuum, as the buildup of pressure could cause a container to explode.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Laws"}
