They describe the process of extracting and preparing the enzyme for further research. Urease is a selective enzyme that accelerates the hydrolysis of urea, which is important for understanding the role of enzymes in biological processes and their potential applications in industry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
