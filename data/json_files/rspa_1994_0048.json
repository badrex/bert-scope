The single group model assumes positrons are implanted in thermal equilibrium and diffuse to the surface, while the two-group model accounts for epithermal positrons. The models help analyze positron beam experiments and provide insights into material physics, particularly in understanding the effects of positron implantation, diffusion, and annihilation in various materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Physics"}
