The researchers found that these neurotransmitters have specific distribution patterns in the neuropil and cell bodies of different lobes in the cephalopod brain. The findings suggest that these neurotransmitters may have specific neurotransmitter functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
