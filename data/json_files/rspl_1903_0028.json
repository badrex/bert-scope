They found that the bactericidal action was entirely confined to the ultra-violet region, with the active radiations lying between wave-lengths 3287 and 2265. The study concluded that the bactericidal action of light is almost entirely due to the action of ultra-violet radiations in this region, and that any source of light used as a bactericidal agent should be rich in these rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
