The formula provides a more accurate representation of the observed and calculated values of optical rotation, and it offers a better theoretical basis compared to previous formulas. The formula also explains the constant effect of the infra-red band and retains its influence in the new formula.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
