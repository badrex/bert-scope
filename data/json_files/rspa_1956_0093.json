The theory aims to calculate the properties of atomic nuclei from a knowledge of the forces acting between nucleons in free space. The nuclear model used is closely related to the nuclear shell model and is determined by a set of self-consistent equations that take into account the strong short-range character of nuclear forces. This new formulation provides a basis for calculating the properties of actual nuclei from first principles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
