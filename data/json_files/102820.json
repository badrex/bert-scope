The bones were found in a muddy soil similar to coastal areas. Somner suggests that the creature may have lived in the sea and could have come to the location through the natural movement of the sea. The discovery raises questions about the local geography and the possibility of sea creatures being found in inland areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
