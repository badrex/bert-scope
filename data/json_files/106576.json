This method involves measuring the velocity of light from stars with known density and comparing it to the velocity of light from other stars. The author also discusses the relationship between the velocity of light, the velocity of falling bodies, and the distance from celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
