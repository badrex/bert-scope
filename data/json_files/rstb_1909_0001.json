They analyzed 87 brains and used various injection methods to visualize the blood supply of the brain. The study provides detailed descriptions of the arterial supply to the basal ganglia, thalamus, and internal capsule, as well as the cortical regions. This research contributes to our understanding of the complex vascularization of the human brain and its implications for various neurological conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
