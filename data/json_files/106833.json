He discovered that during respiration, dephlogisticated air (oxygen) enters the blood and combines with phlogiston (a substance released from the blood) to form fixed air (carbon dioxide). This finding challenged the existing understanding of respiration and the role of dephlogisticated air in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Laws and Chemical Reactions"}
