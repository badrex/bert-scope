They find that strain coupling stabilizes the tetragonal phase and plays a significant role in determining the first-order character of the phase transition. The study also explores the importance of realistic Hamiltonians for future microscopic simulations of microstructure effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
