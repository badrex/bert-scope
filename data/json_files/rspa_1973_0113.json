The authors present new results obtained from their reformulation of the Dexter-Forster theory and discuss the energy transfer cross-sections and quenching constants in both phases. They also compare the energy transfer in solids and gases, highlighting the differences in their mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
