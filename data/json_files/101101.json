He observes the porpess's unique features, such as its single dorsal fin, forked tail, and lack of a blind gut. Ray also discusses the porpess's respiratory system, which allows it to easily surface for air, and its large brain, suggesting high intelligence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
