The study focuses on a peat bog in the northern Pennines and explores the importance of different sources of acidity. The research also investigates the interconversion of sulphur- and nitrogen-containing compounds and their impact on acidity levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
