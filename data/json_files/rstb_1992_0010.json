The authors review their experimental investigations into methods of extracting binary features from images of faces and hands to enable deaf people to communicate using sign language over telephone networks. They describe the theoretical postulates underlying the successful extraction of facial features and the operators used for feature extraction. The article also explores the potential applications of facial feature extraction in visual communication, facial recognition systems, and model-based image coding.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Computer Science and Technology"}
