The study shows that plants in open habitats tend to have larger seeds, while those in shaded areas have smaller seeds. This is due to factors such as the need for rapid growth in open habitats and the benefits of larger food reserves in shaded environments. The author also discusses the impact of human activities, like winnowing, on seed size and mass over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
