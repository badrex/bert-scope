They discovered that the bacterium can grow in the presence of organic matter and can convert ammonia into nitrous acid. The author also found that the nitroso-bacterium can be isolated using various media, such as silica, gelatine, and agar. This research challenges previous beliefs about the nitroso-bacterium's limitations in growing on ordinary media.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
