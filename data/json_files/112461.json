He found that the force of contraction of muscles per square inch is relatively consistent across different muscles and limbs. Haughton also discovered that the cross sections of muscles and their tendons are directly proportional, supporting the principle of economy of force in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomechanics"}
