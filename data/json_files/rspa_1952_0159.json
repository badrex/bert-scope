The author develops formulas for the forces acting on the cylinder and applies them to the idealized animal, establishing a connection between the amplitude and wavelength of the waves of bending and the animal's velocity. The findings are compared with experimental data and photographs of real animals, providing insights into the propulsion methods used by these creatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
