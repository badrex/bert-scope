The muscle is innervated by three nerve fibers supplied from two different nerve trunks, with each muscle unit receiving a discrete branch from the motor nerve and the tracheal system. The study reveals similarities between insect and crustacean muscle innervation and physiological mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
