They find that for low mutation rates, recombination can reduce the quasi-species' diversity and enhance overall fitness. However, for high mutation rates, recombination can push the quasi-species over the error threshold, causing a loss of genetic information. Additionally, recombination introduces bistability to the quasi-species, meaning that if the frequency of an advantageous mutant is below a certain threshold, it will not be selected.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
