They found that the vapour-pressure of a solid is less than that of a liquid at the same temperature, and that the differences between these pressures can be calculated from thermic data. The author also introduced a new method for determining the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids, which offers significant advantages over previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
