They review current understanding of the process and examine the properties of discs around these stars, including the four well-known prototypes Lyr, Pic, Eri, and HL Tau. The authors also discuss the orbital evolution and replenishment of grains in these discs, which play a crucial role in the formation of planetary systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
