The penumbra was seen to last nearly half an hour before the moon was fully eclipsed. A notable fixed star was also observed to be eclipsed during the total obscuration of the moon. The author mentions that more details will be provided by Mr. Hook soon, and also includes an account of the observations made in Paris by the learned Bullialdus.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
