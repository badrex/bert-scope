They use complex variable methods to analyze stress distributions and provide numerical values for stress concentrations in square and triangular holes under different bending conditions. This study helps in understanding the behavior of perforated plates and their practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
