His work on the low-pressure polymerization of ethylene using catalysts, now known as Ziegler catalysts, earned him the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1963. Ziegler's research interests were diverse, and he made important discoveries in alkali organic compounds and the application of physical chemistry to organic reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
