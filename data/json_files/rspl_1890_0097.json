They prepared a series of nitrites and studied their actions on warm-blooded animals and humans. The results showed that nitrites cause a fall in blood pressure due to the dilatation of arterioles, which is independent of any effect on the central nervous system. The authors also discussed the similarities and differences in the effects of various nitrites and their chemical compositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physiology > Cardiovascular System"}
