They discovered a hybrid resonance through a dissociative intermediate state of In2 and discussed the atomic and molecular processes involved in the two-photon absorption. The study provides insights into the spectroscopy of elements with less volatility than alkali metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
