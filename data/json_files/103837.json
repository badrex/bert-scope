The author found the instrument to be useful in predicting bad weather and identifying nearby ice. They also observed compass variations near ice, which made navigation difficult. The author suggests using ice-resistant charts to improve navigation in such conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Climatology"}
