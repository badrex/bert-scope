The author found that static friction on cold snow is high, but when the sliding speed is appreciable, friction decreases to a low value. This low friction is due to localized surface melting caused by frictional heating. The contact angle of water with the surface plays a significant role in determining friction, with surfaces having a high contact angle providing lower friction. The author also discovered that polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) offers very low friction on snow and ice under all conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
