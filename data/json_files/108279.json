Henry, investigates the compounds formed between tin and iodine. He discovers that the previously known compound is a mixture of two salts, one of which is soluble in water without decomposition, while the other is immediately decomposed on contact with water. The author also describes the formation of a new compound, the biniodide of tin, and its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
