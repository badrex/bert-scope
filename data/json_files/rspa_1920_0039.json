Richardson and Sir Napier Shaw extends Osborne Reynolds' theory of the Criterion of Turbulence to include the case where work is done by eddies acting as thermodynamic engines in a gravitating atmosphere. They study the supply of energy to atmospheric eddies, considering factors such as temperature changes, radiation, and molecular viscosity. The authors propose a method to calculate the rate of energy supplied to eddies, which can help understand the behavior of atmospheric turbulence.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
