The author investigates the physical and sensible properties of muscles, their anatomical structure, and the role of nerves in the muscular system. The lecture also explores the relationship between muscle function and temperature, respiration, and the application of chemistry to the subject. Various experiments and observations are presented to support and illustrate the arguments made throughout the lecture."}
