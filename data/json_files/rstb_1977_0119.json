The authors discuss the importance of studying the size structure of these communities and how it affects their composition and interactions. They also examine the role of environmental factors, such as light, nutrients, and temperature, in shaping plankton communities and their trophic levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
