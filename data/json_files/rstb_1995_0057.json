The author discusses the three components of productivity: biomass, yield, and the rate of production. They argue that optical properties, such as absorption by phytoplankton and particle scattering, can help connect the rate of production with biomass and yield at the diel scale. The study examines data from three sites in the North Atlantic to illustrate the optical determinants of primary production.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
