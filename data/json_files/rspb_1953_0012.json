They explain how this helical structure is formed and describe its importance in various proteins, such as hair, muscle, and globular proteins like haemoglobin and myoglobin. The a-helix is determined to be the most stable configuration for proteins based on the structural features and X-ray data analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
