They discuss the distribution of seismic activity along the western escarpment and the Wonji Fault Belt, as well as the relationship between seismic events and tectonic structures in the region. The study provides insights into the structure and evolution of the Afar triangle and its connection to the surrounding areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
