The author uses a siphon-like apparatus to measure the absorption of various gases, including carbonic acid, nitrous, oxygenous, phosphorated hydrogen, azotic, and hydrogen gases. The study shows that water absorbs gases in inverse proportion to the pressure, and the absorption is also affected by the temperature. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of gases in water and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and equilibrium"}
