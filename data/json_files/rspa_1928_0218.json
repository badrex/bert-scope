They derive wave equations in a gravitational field and show that the energy density and current are conjugate quantities. The author also demonstrates how to incorporate electromagnetic and gravitational fields into a unified system using tensor equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism and Gravitation"}
