The research focuses on the formation of blood vessels, the role of endothelium, and the involvement of fibroblasts in tissue repair. The findings provide insights into the healing process and the cellular interactions during tissue regeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
