They analyze magnetic records and propose using the \"character\" figures of days as a measure of disturbance. The author finds that the 27-day period is present in the years 1890-1900 and 1906-1911, and discusses the advantages and limitations of using different measures of magnetic disturbance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geomagnetism"}
