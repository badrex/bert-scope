They found that the magnetic susceptibility of nickel increases after annealing, and longitudinal stress reduces the magnetic susceptibility. The energy dissipation due to hysteresis in nickel is lower than in iron. The study provides valuable insights into the magnetic behavior of nickel, which can be useful for various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
