Proton NMR allows for the detection of various metabolites and offers higher spatial resolution compared to other techniques. The author presents examples of animal and clinical studies that demonstrate the potential of this technique in understanding and diagnosing brain disorders, such as inborn errors of metabolism, stroke, and acute liver failure. The author also highlights the importance of Proton NMR in monitoring metabolic changes during brain development.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology and Neuroimaging"}
