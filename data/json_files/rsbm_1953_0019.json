He is known for his work on the resolution of asymmetric sulphonium salts, the formation of triarylsulphonium salts, and the synthesis of thioxanthone and its derivatives. His research on the 'disulphoxides' provided evidence for the unsymmetrical thiosulphonic ester structure, which expanded the understanding of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
