The authors develop an efficient approach to account for the effects of spectral width and compare their results with large-scale numerical computations from the Joint North Sea Wave Project (JONSWAP). The study shows that the effects of spectral width on nonlinear energy transfer are significant and cannot be neglected.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
