It uses the concept of quadratic forms and ideal factorization to study periodic orbits of Anosov diffeomorphisms of the two-dimensional torus. The results show that the period of the orbits and their dynamical behavior are intimately related to the way ideals factorize in algebraic number fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
