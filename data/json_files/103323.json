The author, Peter Le Neve, suggests that the cause of this phenomenon is due to the nature of the soil, which consists of gravelly soil over quicksand and clay. The author believes that the force of the wind on the leaves and branches of the trees may have loosened the sand beneath them, causing them to sink over time. This theory is supported by the observation of boiling water in the holes when the trees first began to sink, and the fact that the water eventually drained away, leaving the holes dry.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
