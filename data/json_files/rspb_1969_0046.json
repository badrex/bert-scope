The researchers found that genetic changes in the recipient populations occurred due to the unidirectional migration of genetically improved donor populations. The low heritability of the traits involved explains why the phenotypes of the selected migrants did not accurately reflect their genotypes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
