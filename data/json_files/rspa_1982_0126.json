The authors identify the geometric constraints and theorems associated with curved-line folding, which can be used to design sheet-metal products that use these surfaces. This expands the range of engineering products that can be made by folding and bending a single inextensible sheet.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
