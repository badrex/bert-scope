The authors use Stokes' stream-function to calculate the forces necessary to maintain the spheres' motion and find that the analysis is applicable to a similar problem where the spheres are fixed and the fluid streams past them. The study suggests that the principles of fluid dynamics can be related to the quantum mechanics of atomic orbits.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
