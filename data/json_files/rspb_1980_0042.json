The authors discovered that male and female flies have different arrangements of nerve cells in the lobula, which is related to their distinct visual behaviors. The study provides insights into the neural basis of sex-specific visual behaviors in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuroanatomy"}
