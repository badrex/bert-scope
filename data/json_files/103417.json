The author provides a table of the compass variations and makes inferences about the patterns of magnetic variation in the region. The findings could help in understanding the navigational challenges faced during sea voyages and contribute to the study of geomagnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
