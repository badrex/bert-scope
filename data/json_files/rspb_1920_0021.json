Upon examining the film, they found it to consist of large numbers of diatoms, a type of algae. This discovery led the author to investigate the relationship between diatoms and whales, and the potential use of diatoms as a tool to trace whale migrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
