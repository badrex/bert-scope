These equations consider the differences in osmotic and hydrostatic pressures and are derived without assuming Onsager symmetry. The author demonstrates that osmosis occurs by diffusion in leaky pores and provides expressions for reflection coefficients, solute and water velocities, and conductances. This work contributes to a better understanding of solute and water transport in dilute solutions and can be applied to various biological and medical contexts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Biophysics"}
