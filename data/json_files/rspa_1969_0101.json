They observed the formation of defect structures, including amorphous layers, loop dislocations, and stacking faults. The authors found that annealing at higher temperatures stabilizes these defects, and they discuss the possible role of interstitial atoms in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Condensed Matter Physics"}
