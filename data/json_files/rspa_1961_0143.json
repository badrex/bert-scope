The authors observed the behavior of methyl iodide, hydroxyl (OH) radicals, formaldehyde, and iodine (I2) during slow and explosive combustion. They found that the reaction between methyl radicals and oxygen is predominantly third-order, and the behavior of the radicals and products varies under different combustion conditions. The study provides insights into the combustion chemistry of hydrocarbon molecules and the role of radicals in the reaction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
