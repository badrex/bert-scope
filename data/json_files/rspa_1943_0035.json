They discuss the presence of mesons in extensive atmospheric showers, the variation of these showers with altitude, and the structure of some local showers. The study involves the use of a meson selector in coincidence with distant counters, and the authors propose explanations for the observed phenomena, such as knock-on electrons, mesons in showers, and multiple simultaneous mesons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
