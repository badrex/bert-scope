They investigated the relation between the probability of ionization and the energy of the impinging electrons, using silver targets and measuring the variation with tube potential of the emitted radiation. The results provide insights into the relative probability of ionization of an atom in the inner shells by electron impact.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
