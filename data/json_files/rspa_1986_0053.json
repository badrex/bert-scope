They found that reconstructed interstitial defects have significantly lower formation enthalpies, confirming previous interpretations of electrical conductivity and high-resolution electron microscopic results. This study helps to resolve the conflict between computational and experimental results in understanding the nature of small defects in rutile.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Defect Chemistry"}
