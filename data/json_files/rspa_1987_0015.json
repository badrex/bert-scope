The study focuses on the effects of non-parallelism on the growth rate of instability waves and how it influences the direction of maximum linear growth. The research also explores the impact of cross flow on Tollmien-Schlichting instabilities and provides insights into other instabilities and interactions, linear and nonlinear.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
