The author reviews different implementations of TDMA, such as bit-multiplexing, block-multiplexing, and code-division multiplexing, and explores the potential of SDMA, including wavelength-division multiple access (WDMA) and frequency-division multiple access (FDMA). The article also highlights the challenges of synchronizing incoming data and the need for efficient switching systems in optical networks.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telecommunications"}
