This theory explains various drug phenomena, such as the persistence of effect, tachyphylaxis, and the existence of partial agonists. The author tested the theory using the guinea-pig ileum and acetylcholine, histamine, hyoscine, mepyramine, and atropine as drugs. The results support the rate theory and provide a better understanding of drug action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Pharmacology"}
