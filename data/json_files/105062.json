Although the weather was initially unfavorable, the sky cleared up later, allowing for more accurate observations. The eclipse's quantity seemed larger than predicted, and Short compared it to a similar eclipse in 1697. He also made adjustments for the moon's motion in 1733 to further refine the eclipse's timing.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
