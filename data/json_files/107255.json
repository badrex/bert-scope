The blood was propelled by the action of the vessels, with the placenta serving as the source and termination of the circulation. This case challenges previous beliefs about the necessity of a heart for proper development and growth of a foetus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
