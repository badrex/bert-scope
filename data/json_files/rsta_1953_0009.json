The model is based on a classically vibrating molecule that dissociates when a specific internal dimension reaches a critical value. The author compares the extended theory with Kassel's classical theory of a molecule of oscillators and finds that they give similar trends in reaction rates with pressure if the number of effective oscillators in Kassel's model is related to the number of normal modes in the extended theory. The author also provides a table of the function of the general rate, which can be used to estimate reaction rates for specific gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
