It discusses the most general transformation that can be applied to these equations without changing their linearity or order and explains how to deduce invariants from these transformations. The article also covers covariants, dependent variables, and equations, and their relationships to invariants. Lastly, it applies these findings to equations of the second, third, and fourth orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
