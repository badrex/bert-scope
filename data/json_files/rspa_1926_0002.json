They found that nickel and copper can form reactive surface films with carbon monoxide, which enhances their catalytic activity. The formation of these reactive surface films is a crucial factor in the catalytic combustion process, suggesting that the catalytic action of these metals may be more chemical in nature than that of gold. The authors also discovered that freshly-reduced copper is a more active catalyst than nickel.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
