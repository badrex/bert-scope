By considering a distribution of matter in flat space-time, the author obtains an equivalent form of Rayner's model through straightforward calculations. The resulting Whitehead-Rayner universe model accounts for gravity and is invariant under Lorentz transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
