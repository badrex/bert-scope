The author concludes that the fluid's ability to reduce the blue oxide of copper is not due to the presence of grape-sugar or related substances, and further research is needed to determine the exact nature of the reducing substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
