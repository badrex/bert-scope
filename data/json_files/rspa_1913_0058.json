The author discovers that the magnetic properties of claywares are due to the presence of black unfused grains of ferruginous minerals and bluish-black fused globules of complex ferruginous silicates. The author also explains the differences in magnetization between various types of claywares, such as white, cream, grey, yellow, buff, red, or brown claywares, and flashed, brindled, or blue claywares.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ceramics"}
