The neurons were grown in a controlled environment and their responses were recorded using the whole-cell voltage-clamp technique. The cultured neurons had similar characteristics to adult rat submandibular ganglion neurons, with resting potentials around -60mV and smaller responses to acetylcholine compared to adult neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
