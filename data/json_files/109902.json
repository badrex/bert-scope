They observe that blood globules are similar in size and appearance to muscle fibers and can coalesce into various forms. The author also suggests that the extrication of air during blood coagulation may have an important influence on its subsequent texture, leading to the formation of a tubular structure that allows it to communicate with the circulation and become part of the animal's solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
