The theory is based on the idea that the freezing point of water varies with pressure, and that ice's porosity and permeation by liquid water are normal conditions. The author describes a cycle of processes involving pressure, liquefaction, and re-freezing that occurs in glacier ice.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
