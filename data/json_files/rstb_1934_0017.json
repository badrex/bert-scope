The author examines the process of radial growth in conifers and explores the role of cellulose in the cell walls of these cells. By using physical methods and analyzing the structure of adult wood elements, the author aims to understand the properties of the tree's tissues and their industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
