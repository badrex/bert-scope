He determined the proportions in which chlorine combines with various metals and also investigated the relative proportions of oxygen and sulfur in some of these metallic compounds. The author analyzed compounds such as copper, tin, iron, and other metals, discovering their properties and how they interact with other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
