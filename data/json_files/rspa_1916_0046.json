They develop equations for the velocity distribution function and use these to calculate the mean values of various functions related to gas properties. The study also introduces new coefficients of diffusion and provides a deeper understanding of the underlying processes in gas dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas dynamics"}
