The authors use mathematical methods and calculations to determine the repulsive forces and the configuration of stable equilibrium in these crystals. Their findings provide insights into the properties of carbonate crystals and the energy required to separate their metallic ions and groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
