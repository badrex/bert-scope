They discovered that the patterns were consistent with the loss of electrons by Bragg reflexion from a lamellar single crystal in a special state of shear strain. The fringe pattern is an enlargement by a two-dimensional vernier coincidence process of the intersections of origin reflecting planes with the basal plane, and the magnification is related to the shear strain. This research provides a detailed examination of the origin of these patterns and their behavior under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
