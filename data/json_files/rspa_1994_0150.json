The author presents analytical solutions for the radiation pressure in both plane progressive and standing wave fields. The study shows that the influence of viscosity on the radiation force can be quite significant, especially when the magnitude of the sphere's size is comparable to the fluid's viscous wavelength.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
