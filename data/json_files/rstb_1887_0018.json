The author discusses previous research on the topic and describes their own experiments, which successfully infected the roots and produced the tubercles. The exact nature of the parasite remains uncertain, but the author concludes that it is likely to be a fungus or a plasmodium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
