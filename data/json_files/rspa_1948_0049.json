They tested Bailey and Martyn's absorption theory, which suggests that the interaction occurs due to the absorption of waves in the ionosphere. The experiments provided valuable information about the absorbing portions of the ionosphere and supported the absorption hypothesis. The results showed that wave interaction can be used to study the ionosphere's absorption and the relaxation time of electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
