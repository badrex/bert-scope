They found a dense ring of RNA in the perinuclear cytoplasm of a nerve cell body whose axon has been cut, and constructed 5 cell maps of ganglia from different animals to indicate which motor nerve cell body sends its axon out a particular peripheral nerve trunk. This study may provide a basis for understanding the structural and metabolic organization responsible for the particular behavioral capacities of certain populations of neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
