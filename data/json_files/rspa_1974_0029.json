The authors examine the effects of rotational speed, axial gap, and coolant flow rate on heat transfer. They present numerical solutions of the boundary layer equations and compare them with experimental results, providing insights into the cooling of gas turbine disks.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
