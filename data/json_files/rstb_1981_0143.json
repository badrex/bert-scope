It discusses how listeners process speech in real-time, analyzing the input and transforming it into meaningful utterances. The research uses reaction-time tasks to study the temporal properties of speech understanding processes and how listeners construct a message-level interpretation of the input. The findings suggest that the listener's mental operations function optimally by bringing the speech signal into contact with the word-recognition domain as rapidly as possible, allowing for immediate interpretation of the message.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Psycholinguistics"}
