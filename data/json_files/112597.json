He shares the progress made in reducing the old observations and the results of the magnetic disturbances from 1845 to 1865. The study reveals a minimum in magnetic disturbances in early 1864 and a probable maximum in 1859, confirming the decennial period. Chambers also requests improvements for the observatory, such as magnetographs, a suitable room, and a team of computers to process the old observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
