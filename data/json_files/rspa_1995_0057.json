They develop a nonlinear regression model and use a multiresolution algorithm to estimate the displacement field associated with permanent deformation in objects with complex structures. This method can recover the entire internal displacement field of a physical object under deformation by comparing tomographic representations before and after the deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Signal Processing"}
