They discover that for frequencies greater than about 30, some modes are possible where the energy is concentrated near the base of the ionosphere, and the field strength near the ground is small. These modes are called 'whispering gallery modes' and are useful for understanding the behavior of radio waves in the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
