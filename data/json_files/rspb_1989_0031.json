The research focuses on symmetrical and asymmetrical vergence responses, finding that asymmetrical vergence is largely saccadic, while symmetrical vergence is primarily smooth. The results suggest that the oculomotor system is capable of effective binocular vision under natural conditions, despite previous observations suggesting otherwise.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision Science"}
