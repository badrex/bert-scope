The author examines the structural pattern of the rift system, the influence of transcurrent faulting, and the formation of the Red Sea, Gulf of Aden, and African rifts. The study also explores the application of plate tectonics to the Red Sea and Gulf of Aden, revealing challenges in understanding the separation of Arabia and Africa."}
