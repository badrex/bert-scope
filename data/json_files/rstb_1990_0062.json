Researchers collected modern diatom data from various lakes and used it to create a model for reconstructing past lake-water conditions. Two numerical approaches, maximum likelihood Gaussian logit regression and weighted averaging regression, were used to infer past lake-water pH levels from fossil diatom assemblages. The results were evaluated using split-sampling and bootstrapping techniques to estimate prediction errors and assess the methods' effectiveness. These reconstructions provide valuable information for understanding lake acidification and its effects on ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleolimnology"}
