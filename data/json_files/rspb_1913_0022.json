They found that 31.7% of the animals tested positive for pathogenic trypanosomes, with the most common species being Trypanosoma brucei vel rhodesiense. The authors recommend controlling the population of these wild animals in the fly-infested areas to prevent the spread of the disease to humans and domestic animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
