The research demonstrates that secondary cycling of the pathogen after a single spray application provides a biological substitute for chemical persistence, making it an effective and environmentally friendly alternative to traditional chemical pesticides. The findings have significant implications for the economics of biopesticide use in pest control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
