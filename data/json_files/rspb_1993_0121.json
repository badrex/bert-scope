The results show that melatonin injections did not prevent photoinduction but instead stimulated reproduction, suggesting that birds may not rely on the duration of the melatonin signal for photoperiodic time measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
