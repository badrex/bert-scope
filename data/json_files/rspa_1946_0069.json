They find that for a fixed value of the critical angular speed, there is only a limited number of possible wavelengths, which leads to the conclusion that the motion becomes turbulent for large values of the parameter. The solution confirms previous theoretical conclusions and shows a complete agreement with numerical results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
