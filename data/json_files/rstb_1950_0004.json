They found that many embryos developed normally after the operation, and that the orientation of the primitive streak does not control the orientation of the embryo. The results suggest that the primitive streak is highly labile in its powers of differentiation and is subject to control by the surrounding blastoderm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
