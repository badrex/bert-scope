They found that the spin-orbit interaction and trigonal ligand field play a significant role in the behavior of titanium's crystalline fields. Their findings support the idea that both second- and fourth-order anisotropic field parameters are important in titanium chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystal Field Theory"}
