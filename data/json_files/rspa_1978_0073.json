They argue that the momentum is divided into an 'electromagnetic' component and a'mechanical' component, which is bodily present in the medium. The author also explains the discrepancy between the Minkowski and Abraham tensors in predicting the radiation pressure exerted by a beam of light in a refracting medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
