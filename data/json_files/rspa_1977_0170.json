They show that in the long wave limit, the phase velocities of acoustic waves are governed by the elastic constants, which is equivalent to the continuous elasticity theory. The results can be used to define the elastic constants using dynamical experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
