The experiment focused on precise measurement of electrons, photons, and muons using a large solenoidal magnetic field. Highlights from the results obtained during the first two years of data-taking are discussed, including the detector's performance and physics goals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
