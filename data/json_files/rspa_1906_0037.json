They analyze the effects of tidal friction and deformation on the satellite's shape and determine the conditions for partial and complete secular stability. The study also explores the possibility of satellite formation and the applicability of these ideas to the explanation of the birth of satellites or double stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
