They discovered that the rate of extension for a given load becomes constant over time if the stress is kept constant. The author proposed a formula to represent the relationship between length, time, and stress in the viscous flow of metals, and found that this formula accurately represents the observed data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
