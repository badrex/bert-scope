The author uses recent results from Mel'nikov and others to prove the existence of these motions and analyzes their structure using the Poincar\u00e9 map. The strange attractor arises from a deterministic differential equation and is connected to homoclinic orbits resulting from global bifurcations. The article highlights the limitations of conventional averaging methods in detecting or obscuring important behavior in nonlinear vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
