The study shows that the characteristic polynomial of the rotorcraft system is diffeomorphic to a versal unfolding of the cusp catastrophe germ. The results provide an exact solution for predicting critical speeds and improving helicopter safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
