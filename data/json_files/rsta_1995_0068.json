The authors found a significant decrease in global irradiance, which they attribute to the influx of polluted air from industrial regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This pollution-induced cooling could explain the absence of temperature increases in the Arctic, as it offsets the enhanced surface warming predicted by general circulation models.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Change"}
