They develop a dynamic model to explore the conditions for the evolution and maintenance of honest signaling, finding that it occurs when the cost of signaling is higher for low-quality prey than for high-quality prey. This research sheds light on how animals communicate their quality to potential mates or rivals, and how this communication can be maintained in a population.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
