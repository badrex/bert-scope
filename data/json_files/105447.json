The double round base prevents air ascent and mercury fall, while the small bowl at the top with beads inside makes it less prone to breaking. The barometer can be easily carried in a walking stick and is easily vacated by boiling the quicksilver in the tube. This instrument allows for more accurate weather observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
