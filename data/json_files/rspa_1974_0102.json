They conclude that the instability predicted by the cut-off approximation is spurious, and the vortex ring's stability cannot be determined by a leading-order analysis. The authors believe that the instability of vortex rings is accounted for by the theory proposed by Saffman (1972) and depends on the details of the vorticity distribution in the core.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
