The author finds that hydrogen increases the current and changes the behavior of old platinum wires. The research suggests that hydrogen dissolves in the platinum surface and forms a stable chemical combination. This discovery helps to understand the interaction between hydrogen and platinum, which is essential for various applications, such as fuel cells and sensors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
