They found that the characters of long-style and short-style have a Mendelian inheritance, with short style being dominant and long style being recessive. The study also explored the inheritance of flower color and other characters, and the authors discovered a peculiar type of Primula sinensis with a yellow flush, which they called \"equal-styled.\" The inheritance of these traits follows the rules of Mendelian genetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
