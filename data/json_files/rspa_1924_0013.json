They discuss the ejection of natural beta-ray groups and the similarities between the level systems of radium B and radium C. The study also explores the internal conversion of y-rays and its implications for understanding the nucleus and electronic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
