They found specific heat anomalies that likely extend from the absolute zero of temperature to the region of the resistance minimum. The entropy contents of these anomalies suggest that only two energy states of the iron ions are involved in the resistance minimum phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
