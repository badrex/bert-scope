He also discusses the properties of leucic acid ether, its reaction with solutions of baryta and potash, and the production of leucic acid from oxalic acid. This process provides insight into the molecular constitution of organic acids like lactic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
