They found that the oxidation of metals is the primary cause of electric phenomena. The author also demonstrated that electricity can decompose water and that the same chemical power can be transferred using a common electrical machine. This confirms that electricity and galvanism are essentially the same and that their differences are due to variations in intensity and production methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
