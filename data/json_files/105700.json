He discovered that these wasps dig holes in the ground to lay their eggs, which turn into maggots. The wasps catch flies to feed the maggots until they reach maturity. Bartram also noted the remarkable order of nature in controlling the population of these insects and the different methods used by various wasp species to build their nests and feed their young.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
