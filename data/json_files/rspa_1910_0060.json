The researchers conducted experiments using different gases and found two relations that apply to all the studied gases. These relations help in understanding the nature of the absorption phenomena and provide insights into the separation of mixed gases using charcoal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
