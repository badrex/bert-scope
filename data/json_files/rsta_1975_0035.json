They prove that solutions have the same number of derivatives as the initial data and that these derivatives depend continuously on time. The study of this equation has significant implications for understanding long water waves and other physical systems with nonlinear dispersion.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
