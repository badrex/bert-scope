The author investigates the morphology and behavior of these urchins, focusing on their burrowing habits and the nature of the substratum. The research reveals that the changes in the urchins are likely due to either an improvement in their adaptation or a change in their niche.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
