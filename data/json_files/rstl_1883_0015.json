The fossils provide insight into the animal's dental system and habits, as well as its evolutionary adaptations. The author also compares the dentition of Thylacoleo to that of other marsupials and finds similarities in the extreme functional modification of their teeth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
