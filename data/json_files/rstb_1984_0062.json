It explores the processes of deposition, plant uptake, and soil exchange, and their impact on forest ecosystems. The study highlights the role of vegetation in altering the acidity of rainwater and its implications for soil and plant health. The findings emphasize the importance of understanding these interactions to mitigate the effects of atmospheric pollution on ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
