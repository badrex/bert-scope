The author, Alexander Fraser, describes the methods of preparation and results of his observations on various mammalian embryos. He traces the origin of the ossicles from the mandibular cartilage and compares the embryonic forms to their adult counterparts. The author also highlights the role of the seventh nerve and the development of the stapes, including its articulation with other bones in the auditory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
