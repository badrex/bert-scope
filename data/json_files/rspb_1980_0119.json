It highlights the wide distribution of peptide systems in the brain, spinal cord, and peripheral nervous system. The study also emphasizes the importance of understanding the coexistence of peptides and classical neurotransmitters in neurons and their potential role in neurotransmission and modulating physiological responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
