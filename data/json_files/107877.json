He discovered that an unequal distribution of magnetism in the needle's branches causes the needle to deflect differently. This research is important for understanding the accuracy of magnetic experiments and supports the theory of iron becoming magnetic due to induction from the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
