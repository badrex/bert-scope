They propose new assignments for these frequencies that better align with the observed regularities in isoelectronic molecules. The new assignments provide a more accurate interpretation of the molecules' properties and help to understand their behavior in various processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
