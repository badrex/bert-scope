It introduces the phenomenon of indeterminate dynamic bifurcations, where the response of a system after passing through critical parameter values can be extremely sensitive to initial conditions or parameter states. This new form of unpredictability is an important concept in the theory of non-stationary dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
