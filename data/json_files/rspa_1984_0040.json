The researchers found that the efficiency of photolysis increases with the size of the crystals, and that larger crystals collect more photons. The results support the Gurney-Mott model and explain differences in photographic behavior between AgCl and AgBr. The effects of surface chemical doping and halide composition were also studied.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
