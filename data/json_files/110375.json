He studied the properties and compositions of phosphate of soda, pyrophosphate of soda, and biphosphate of soda. The biphosphate of soda underwent several changes in composition and properties, making it an object of interest. The author also explored the modifications of phosphoric acid resulting from these inquiries.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
