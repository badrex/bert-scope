The research shows that there is no significant transfer of these antibodies before birth, and the postnatal transfer is very low. The antibodies are present in the mother's milk, but the transmission to the young appears to be inefficient compared to other species. The placenta and yolk-sac structures in hedgehogs are discussed in relation to the antibody transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
