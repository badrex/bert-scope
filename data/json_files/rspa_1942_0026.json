They found that major changes in molecular configuration due to rotation around single bonds occur at the crystallization point, leading to the flexibility and elasticity of these materials. The author also explains the low crystallization temperatures of these polymers and correlates their mechanical properties with molecular behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
