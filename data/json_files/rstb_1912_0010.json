They analyze various theories and methods used by other researchers, and through their own observations, they conclude that the nerve fibers reach the dentine-pulp boundary but cannot be traced further into the dentine. The findings contribute to the understanding of the sensory impressions and sensitivity of human teeth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Histology"}
