They deduced the penetration depth and found evidence of anisotropy. The high-frequency resistance of the superconducting phase showed a similar behavior to tin. This study supports the non-local theory of superconductivity proposed by Pippard and suggests that further research on other superconductors could yield valuable data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
