The results showed that adrenine has a powerful motor effect on both non-pregnant uterus and Fallopian tubes, suggesting that the sympathetic nerve supply to the human uterus is motor in quality. In contrast, pituitrin stimulated the contraction of the non-pregnant uterus but had no significant effect on the Fallopian tube. This study is important for understanding the use of adrenine and other sympathomimetic substances in human labor and medical treatments."}
