They discovered that antidromic impulses in motor nerve fibers can block reflex discharge for a short period, affecting the latent period and the reflex response. This study provides insights into the complex interactions between nerve impulses and the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Motor Control and Reflexes"}
