They found that myosin and C-protein are antigenically distinct, meaning C-protein is not derived from myosin. The study also showed that purified myosin can behave as a classically simple antigen, while C-protein is a powerful immunogen. This information is important for understanding the location of these proteins within muscle fibers and for developing antibodies to study muscle structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
