The protein is a transmembrane peptide that plays a crucial part in the C1-HC03 exchange system, which is essential for CO2 transport from tissues to lungs. The band 3 protein has two membrane-bound segments, which are required for transport, and a water-soluble N-terminal segment that provides attachment sites for cytoskeletal elements. The anion-binding sites in the protein can alternate between exposure to the inside and outside compartments, allowing for the transport of anions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
