They found that peridotites are common at fracture zones and in unfractured sections of the ridge. The chemistry of these rocks suggests that they are not genetically related to the associated gabbro-basalt. The data indicate similarities between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and alpine complexes worldwide.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
