They discovered that disks can selectively encapsidate specific RNA fragments, forming short nucleoprotein rods. The encapsidated fragments have distinct properties, such as purine-rich and cytosine-poor sequences near their termini and a periodicity of order three in purine residues. This research provides insight into the recognition process during TMV reconstitution and the nature of the disk recognition site.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
