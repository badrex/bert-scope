They found that radium had a germicidal action, killing specific and extraneous micro-organisms in vaccine samples and other bacteria after exposure to the radium at a distance of 1-2 mm for varying lengths of time. This research provided new insights into the regulation of animal heat and the potential use of radium in sterilization processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
