He discovered new terms and phenomena on the sun's surface, such as openings, shallows, ridges, nodules, corrugations, indentations, and pores. These observations helped improve our understanding of the sun's physical construction and its influence on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Astronomy"}
