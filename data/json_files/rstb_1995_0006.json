The system involves two recombinase proteins, XerC and XerD, and accessory proteins ArgR and PepA. The authors analyze the formation of recombinational synapses and the catalysis of strand exchange in vitro, demonstrating how the same two recombination proteins can act with different outcomes depending on the organization of DNA sites. The study also highlights the role of site-specific recombination in various programmed DNA rearrangements in microbes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
