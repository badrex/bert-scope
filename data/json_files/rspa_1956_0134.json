They find a continuous solution in the quarter plane that satisfies Cauchy data on the boundary. The solution is obtained using contour integral methods and is applicable for positive values of the parameter. The author also discusses the connection between the contour integral solutions and solutions involving Bessel functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
