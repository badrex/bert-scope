They develop a comprehensive theory based on the mechanics of continuous media and use the Rheogoniometer to measure and analyze the behavior of hydrocarbon gels under various mechanical actions. The study reveals the presence of anisotropic phenomena in general hydrocarbon gels, while special hydrocarbon gels exhibit isotropic behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics of Continuous Media"}
