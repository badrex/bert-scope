The soil's formation involved clay illuviation, gleying, rubification, and periglacial disruption. The environmental deterioration from a temperate optimum to periglacial conditions is proposed, with the soil forming during the Cromerian and early parts of the Anglian Stage. The soil's study provides valuable information on environmental changes and helps in understanding the Quaternary stratigraphy of the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Pedology"}
