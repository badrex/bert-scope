One process uses a compressed supercritical gas as a solvent, while the other uses a process-derived liquid. The chemical nature and average structures of the extracts obtained through supercritical gas extraction from low-rank UK coals are investigated, revealing small aromatic clusters joined by methylene, ether, and diphenyl linkages. These findings contribute to understanding the potential of supercritical gas solvents in coal extraction and conversion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Engineering"}
