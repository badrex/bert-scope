They investigate the relative heating and illuminating powers of these gases and propose a new method for analyzing mixtures of hydrogen and carburetted hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and carbonic acid. The study provides insights into the composition of coal gas and oil gas, which were essential for understanding their applications in illumination and heating.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fuel chemistry"}
