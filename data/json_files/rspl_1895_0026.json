The author describes experiments using solid solutions in agar-agar jelly to trace the motion of ions by the formation of a precipitate. The study focuses on the influence of jelly, potential-gradient, and conductivity on the velocities of ions, providing valuable insights into the field of electrochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
