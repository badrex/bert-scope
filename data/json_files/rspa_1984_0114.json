They calculate the electromagnetic fields near a chiral molecule and apply the theory to induced circular dichroism, which is the differential absorption of left- and right-circularly polarized light by an achiral molecule in a chiral environment. The results are presented for tumble-averaged and randomly oriented molecular pairs.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
