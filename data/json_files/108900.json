The author conducted experiments to understand how blood acts in the body and how it reacts to various substances. The study found that both arterial and venous blood have similar effects on gases, with venous blood absorbing more oxygen and releasing more carbon dioxide. The research also showed that the longer air is in contact with blood, the greater the change in its chemical composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Hematology"}
