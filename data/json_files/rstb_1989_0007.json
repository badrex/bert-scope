The authors emphasize the importance of measuring other independent photosynthesis signals to obtain specific information from complex fluorescence responses. They introduce a pulse-amplitude modulation fluorometer (pam fluorometer) that can measure absorbance changes in parallel with fluorescence, providing deeper insights into the control of electron transfer in photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
