The authors discovered that the activity of the platinum surface can be altered by pre-treatment, and that a passive platinum surface can be created by heating the metal in oxygen. The study also suggests that the presence of a base metal impurity in the platinum may be responsible for the observed phenomena. The research has implications for understanding the thermionic emission of platinum and the mechanism of the catalytic combination of hydrogen and oxygen at the surface."}
