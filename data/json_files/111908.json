Hofmann, investigates the properties of poly-ammonias, specifically focusing on diamines. By examining the formation of salts and the reactions of ammonia compounds, Hofmann determines the atomicity of diamines and provides a method for diagnosing them. This research contributes to the understanding of ammonia derivatives and their chemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
