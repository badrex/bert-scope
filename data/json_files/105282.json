He found that the total number of houses in the country was 1,427,110, and based on this, he estimated the population to be slightly over seven and a half million. Forster acknowledges that his method is not perfect but believes it is closer to the truth than previous estimates.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Demography"}
