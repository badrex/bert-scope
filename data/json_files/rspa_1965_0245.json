It discusses the data available for studying winds in the atmosphere and presents mean latitudinal cross-sections of zonal wind at equinoxes and solstices. The article also explores the transition zone between 80 and 120 km, where large-scale irregularities and gravity waves play a significant role in air movements. The study of these phenomena helps in understanding the forces driving the circulation and the physical processes occurring in the lower thermosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
