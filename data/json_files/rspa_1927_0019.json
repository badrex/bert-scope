They find that both instruments provide consistent results within a 2% experimental error range. The study also reveals that the photographic method agrees well with the photoelectric and visual methods in the visible region, but may have a higher error rate compared to the photoelectric method in the ultraviolet region.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
