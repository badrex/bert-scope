The measurements were taken using triangulation and chain measurements, and the results were used to calculate the mean degree of the Earth's surface. This work contributed to the understanding of the Earth's shape and helped in the development of surveying techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
