The theory separates the collision process into compression and restitution phases, considering the effects of slip, slip reversal, and energy dissipation due to friction and internal inelastic behavior. This approach contrasts with Newton's impact law and Poisson's hypothesis, which can yield erroneous results when slip stops or changes direction during a non-collinear collision.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
