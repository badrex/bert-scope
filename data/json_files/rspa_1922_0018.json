They found that the reactions have different temperature coefficients, with one reaction having a higher coefficient. The results support the theory of heterogeneous catalysis, where reactions occur in a unimolecular layer at the surface of the catalyst.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
