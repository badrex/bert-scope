Lane, conducted experiments to determine if iron can be dissolved in simple water with the help of fixed air. The experiments showed that iron can be soluble in simple water when fixed air is present, and this discovery helps explain the properties of various mineral waters and their metallic charges.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy and Mineral Chemistry"}
