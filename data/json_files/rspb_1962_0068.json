It explores the various pathways leading to the formation of ommochromes and nicotinic acid from tryptophan. The article also highlights the discovery of tryptophanase, an enzyme that breaks down tryptophan into indole and alanine, and how its synthesis is regulated by the presence of other amino acids like phenylalanine and tyrosine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
