This method is simple, accurate, and sensitive, allowing for the estimation of carbon dioxide levels in ordinary air without the need for a spectrometer. The technique involves measuring the total transmission of radiation through the air sample, which eliminates the need for sensitive detecting apparatus and reduces the impact of temperature variations on the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
