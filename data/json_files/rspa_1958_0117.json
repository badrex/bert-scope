The authors found that the degree of oxidation is directly related to the intensity of the ultrasonic radiation, and they propose a hypothesis that high temperatures are produced at certain favored spots, leading to the oxidation of the aldehyde.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Chemical Kinetics"}
