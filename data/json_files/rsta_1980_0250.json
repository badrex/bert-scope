These pulses were used to study the dynamics of vibrational modes in polyatomic molecules by exciting specific molecular vibrations and monitoring their instantaneous states. The authors also demonstrated efficient generation of subpicosecond pulses and explored their applications in vibrational relaxation and fluorescence probing techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Laser Physics"}
