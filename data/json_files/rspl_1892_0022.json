The research examines the distribution of turacin in various species, its chemical composition, and its behavior under different conditions. Turacin is found in eighteen out of the twenty-five known species of Musophagidae and has a unique spectrum. The study also discusses turacin's similarities and differences with other pigments, such as haematin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
