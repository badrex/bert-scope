The authors explore two discrete and two continuous models of stick-slip systems, demonstrating their rich bifurcational and chaotic behavior. They also discuss the challenges in analyzing these non-smooth systems and the importance of distinguishing chaotic phenomena from noise in measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
