These theorems are useful in the field of calculus and can help simplify mathematical computations. Landen demonstrates how these theorems can be applied to various scenarios, including calculating the properties of circles and the values of trigonometric functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Trigonometry"}
