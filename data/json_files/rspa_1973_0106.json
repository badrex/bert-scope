They observed various transient intermediates following conventional and nanosecond flash photolysis of plastoquinone-1 and plastoquinone-9. The results provide insight into the function of these quinones in photosynthesis and the potential biological effects of UV irradiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
