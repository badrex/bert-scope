They found that the Tsai-Wu anisotropic yield criterion best predicted the pattern of microcracking. The presence of microdamage in bone before failure suggests that damage-based criteria are more likely to be successful predictors of bone remodeling behavior than stress or strain-based criteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Biomechanics and Biomedical Engineering"}
