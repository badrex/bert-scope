The results show that the sensory epithelium of the osphradium reflects environmental conditions, while the ultrastructure of osphradial cell types reflects taxonomic relations. This information can be used to differentiate between taxa and improve our understanding of prosobranch evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Mollusks"}
