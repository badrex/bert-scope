The reassembly involves the co-aggregation of RNA and protein at a neutral pH and ionic strength of 0.2, resulting in 70% encapsidation. The reassembled virus shows stability similar to native CCMV, with the same molecular mass, buoyant density, and surface morphology. The study also investigates the structural transitions of CCMV particles and the states of aggregation of the isolated protein, providing insights into the mechanism of assembly.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
