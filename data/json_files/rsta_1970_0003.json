The theory involves generating functions expressed as power series and is applied to sequences and forests generated by various polynomials of low degree. The study of these forests can be related to the Gilbreath conjecture, which concerns the absolute differences derived from the list of prime numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics"}
