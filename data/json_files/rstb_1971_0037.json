This microscope offers advantages over conventional microscopes, particularly in studying stained molecules and surface details of thick specimens. The microscope's potential for high-resolution imaging and its ability to separate energy-loss electrons from no-loss electrons make it a promising tool for biological research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
