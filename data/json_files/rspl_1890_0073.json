They found that rebreathing air led to a decrease in the volume of air breathed out and an increase in the amount of carbon dioxide in the body. The author also observed that after rebreathing, the person's breathing rate and comfort improved when they inhaled fresh air.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
