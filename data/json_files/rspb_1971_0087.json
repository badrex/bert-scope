It identifies two types of sensory cells, hair cells and second sensory cells, which differ in their ciliary arrangement and cytoplasmic organization. The hair cells have stereocilia and a kinocilium, while the second sensory cells have many vacuoles, long microvilli, and a single cilium. These findings contribute to the understanding of the acoustico-lateralis system in fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
