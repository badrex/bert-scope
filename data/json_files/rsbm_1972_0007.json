He discovered an improved ammonia catalyst for the synthesis of ammonia and conducted extensive research on gas reactions in discharges, catalytic reactions, and the properties of surfaces and thin films. Finch also played a crucial role in the development of the Finch camera, which allowed for the examination of crystal structures and textures. Additionally, Finch was an accomplished mountaineer, participating in the 1922 Everest expedition and setting altitude records at the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Applied Physical Chemistry"}
