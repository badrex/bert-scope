They used mass spectrometry to analyze the reactions of ethane on the platinum filament at high temperatures (1300-1800 K) and low pressures (10^-4 to 10^-7 mmHg). The results showed that the activity of the filament depended on its pre-treatment, and that the reaction probability of ethane molecules with the filament changed as the filament aged. The study provided insights into the mechanisms of catalysis by metals and the behavior of individual molecules on catalyst surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
