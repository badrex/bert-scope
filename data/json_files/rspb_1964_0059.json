It explores the breakdown of phosphocreatine (PC) and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) during muscle contractions and the efficiency of energy conversion. The author also examines the discrepancies in energy production and chemical reactions, and the possibility of reversible coupling between chemical and mechanical events in muscle contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
