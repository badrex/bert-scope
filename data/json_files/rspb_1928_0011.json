They found that both viruses share similarities in their clinical and pathological features, and that young chicks are more susceptible to both viruses. The study also revealed that the reticuloendothelial system plays a crucial role in removing viruses from the bloodstream, and that the virus can only enter epidermal cells when they are undergoing mitosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
