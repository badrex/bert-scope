They used a method of \"successive degeneration\" to identify and analyze the microscopic course of the channels involved. Their findings demonstrate the existence of abundant aborally-running fiber systems in various spinal segments, which they classified into four main categories: ventral short fibers, ventral long fibers, lateral short fibers, and lateral long fibers. These categories are essential for understanding the complex network of spinal cord communication and reflexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
