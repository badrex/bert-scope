They discovered that the color-changing matter in blood can exist in two states of oxidation, which they named \"cruorine\" and \"scarlet cruorine.\" The author also found that certain reducing agents can change the color of the blood, and that the blood's colorant can absorb oxygen from the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
