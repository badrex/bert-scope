They found that increasing pressure causes the separation of the upper and lower limiting concentrations of the sensitizer to increase, and that all foreign gases lengthen the induction periods and eventually quench the ignition of the explosive mixture. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of chain reactions and the role of catalysts and inhibitors in controlling ignition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
