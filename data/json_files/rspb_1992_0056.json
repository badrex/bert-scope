The results show that these photoreceptors have an atypical light adaptation process, allowing them to maintain a constant relation with the absolute level of light irradiance, which is essential for their voltage-dependent synthesis and secretion of indolamines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
