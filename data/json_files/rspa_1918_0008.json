The experiment involves a wooden frame, a vertical rod, and a flywheel attached to a spindle. The phenomenon occurs due to the centrifugal couples arising from the unbalanced flywheel and the oscillatory motion of the vertical stem and gyroscope. This discovery has implications for understanding gyroscopic behavior and potential applications in engineering."}
