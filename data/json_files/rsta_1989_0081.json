The authors discuss two applications of quantum groups in conformal field theory: open Verlinde operators and solutions to polynomial equations. They also examine the representation theory of quantum groups and their potential role in understanding the space of classical solutions to string theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
