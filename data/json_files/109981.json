The author, Charles Hutton, discusses the advantages and limitations of the mountain experiment and the small balls experiment by Mr. Cavendish. He concludes that the mountain experiment is more accurate and suggests using a large pyramid in Egypt for a future experiment due to its larger mass and more accessible center for observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
