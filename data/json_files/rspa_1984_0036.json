The method is compared with previous work using a modal approach, showing good agreement. The study extends the analysis to more realistic curved-wall channels, also with positive results. The research provides an alternative approach to previous W.K.B. methods and offers a numerical solution to the disturbance equations for slowly varying flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
