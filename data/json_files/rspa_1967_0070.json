The sticking probability of nitrogen on tungsten is found to be independent of both temperature and coverage at low temperatures. At higher temperatures, the sticking probability decreases with increasing temperature and coverage. The results are interpreted in terms of a physically adsorbed precursor state with a heat of adsorption of around 1 kcal/mole. Desorption spectra were obtained by warming the films and recording the subsequent pressure changes, which helped evaluate the distribution of site energies for the weakly held adsorbate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Science"}
