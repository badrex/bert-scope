The authors explore the role of polyynes in the formation of fullerenes, a unique form of carbon with potential applications in materials science and nanotechnology. They also examine the detection of polyynes and other carbon chains in space, which has led to a better understanding of the chemistry of carbon in the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
