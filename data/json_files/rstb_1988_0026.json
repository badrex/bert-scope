Using aminostratigraphy and other dating methods, the authors recognize eight high-sea-level events and their corresponding glaciations. This research helps to model ice accumulation, precipitation patterns, and the circulation of the North Atlantic Ocean, contributing to a better understanding of climatic change in the British Isles and Europe.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Stratigraphy and Paleoclimatology"}
