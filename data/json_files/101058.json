They observed that trees bled more when exposed to frost and warmth, and that different tree species reacted differently to these conditions. The authors also discussed the possibility of a circulation system in plants, similar to the circulatory system in animals, and the role of vessels in transporting sap.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
