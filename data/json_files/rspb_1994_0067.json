They propose a model that incorporates sib competition and sperm competitiveness to explain these phenomena. The model suggests that deleterious mutations affecting sperm competitiveness lead to sib or intra-ejaculate competition, and if inter-ejaculate competition exists, there will be selection for increased recombination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
