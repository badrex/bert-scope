Using whole-cell voltage-clamp techniques, they found that the nucleus acts as an electrically isolated compartment that separates charged low molecular mass molecules, including inorganic ions. This study provides evidence that the nuclear envelope is selective and permeable to ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
