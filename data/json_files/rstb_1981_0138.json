It discusses how the tense system of a language interacts with other syntactic, semantic, and pragmatic variables to determine the intended time of an event or state. The author claims that the default meaning of tense markers can be overruled by linguistic or contextual factors, and provides examples to illustrate these possibilities. The implications of these analyses for traditional Chomskyan notions of grammaticality and acceptability are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Linguistics > Semantics and Pragmatics"}
