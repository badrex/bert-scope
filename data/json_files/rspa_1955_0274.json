It explores how magneto-hydrodynamic forces affect the velocity profile of fluids and how the sensitivity of flowmeters depends on these factors. The article also examines the entry problem, boundary layers, and the transition to turbulence in fluid flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
