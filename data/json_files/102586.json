Fleas lay eggs that hatch into worms, which create silk-like bags and transform into fleas. These fleas deposit their eggs on animals or in their sleeping areas, leading to the birth of white, pearl-colored worms that feed on branny substances. After a few weeks, the fleas emerge from their bags, gain color and strength, and leap away.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
