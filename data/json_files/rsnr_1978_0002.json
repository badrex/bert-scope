It highlights the contributions of various Royal Society fellows in the evolution of the sextant, from the seaman's quadrant to the Davis quadrant. The mariner's sextant became the symbol of the navigator's craft, enabling accurate measurements of celestial bodies' altitudes for determining latitude and improving dead reckoning navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science and Technology"}
