The research shows that frequent interruptions of red light during the night can cause a phase shift in the stomatal opening rhythm, and that this response is not reversed by following the red light interruptions with far-red light. The findings suggest that the stomatal response to low-intensity light may involve a different pigment system than the one responsible for ordinary stomatal opening in light.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
