The author presents five different models for analyzing data from cross-over designs, focusing on models that incorporate autoregressive effects and residual correlations. The article also explores the use of 4-point assays, which enable potency estimation and provide a check on the validity of the procedure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Bioassay and Experimental Design"}
