The author examines various cross-sections, including those bounded by confocal conics, and explores the effects of keyways on torsional rigidity and maximum stress. The study provides insights into the theory of elasticity and practical applications in engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
