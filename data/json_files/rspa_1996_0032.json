The authors use an axisymmetrical finite-element model to study the impact of matrix properties on interfacial shear stress and find that matrix yield strain is the main parameter controlling the fiber fragmentation process. They also compare the stress field developed around a short fiber embedded in a matrix with existing one-dimensional and bi-dimensional models and discuss the limitations of elastic theories for normalizing the value of interfacial shear strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Composite Materials"}
