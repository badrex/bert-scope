They conclude that the weight should be between 999.96 and 999.76 grams, with the most accurate determinations made by M. Kupffer and Mr. Chaney. The study emphasizes the importance of using pure water, accurate thermometers, and direct comparisons with primary standards of weight and measure for reliable results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Metrology"}
