The authors derive convenient formulae for the ellipticity and phase difference of the reflected and transmitted light and compare them with recent experimental results. The study reveals the significant impact of plate thickness on the optical properties and the influence of the surrounding medium on the reflected light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
