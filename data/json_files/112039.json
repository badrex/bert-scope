They discovered that when heated to redness, the density of minerals like idocrase, garnets, and felspar decreases temporarily but returns to its original state after a month. This phenomenon suggests that minerals can absorb and release heat without undergoing a change of state or composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
