They discovered that different tissues diverged from \"air equivalence\" and observed a region of maximum sensitivity in the medium wavelengths. The results have implications for understanding energy absorption in animal tissues and designing radiation detection devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Medical Physics"}
