The method is based on representing the boundary effects by a series of exponentially decaying harmonics associated with each edge of the polygon. The resulting simultaneous equations are suitable for electronic computer generation and solution. The author demonstrates the power and simplicity of the method by solving the torsion problem for a hollow square.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
