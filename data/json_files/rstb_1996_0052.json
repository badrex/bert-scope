The authors describe the role of sigma factors in gene expression during sporulation and how the activity of the sigma factor (aF) is regulated by an anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAB, which is controlled by an anti-anti-sigma factor, SpoIIAA. The biochemical basis for the temporal and spatial regulation of aF activity is also explored, including the potential role of changes in adenine nucleotides.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
