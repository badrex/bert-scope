It explores the process of acclimatization, which allows humans to adapt to the reduced oxygen levels found at high altitudes, and the various factors that contribute to chronic and acute anoxia. The article also highlights the importance of oxygen use in high-altitude environments to prevent damage to the brain and other organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Physiology of High Altitude"}
