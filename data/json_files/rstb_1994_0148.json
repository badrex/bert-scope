It explores how parasites can affect social organization and mating systems, leading to increased genetic variability among colony members. The authors also examine the role of parasites in shaping the transmission of diseases within and between colonies, as well as the impact of parasitism on colony behavior and division of labor.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
