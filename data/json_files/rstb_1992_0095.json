The author argues that southern Africa was an isolated region during the late Pleistocene, allowing for continuity and survival of the Bushman (San) population. The study of genetic markers and mitochondrial DNA supports the idea that the Bushman population has a long evolutionary history in the region, with estimates of over 100,000 years of presence. The author also examines the cultural and cognitive abilities of the people in the earlier late Pleistocene, suggesting that they were comparable to those of their Holocene and modern descendants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
