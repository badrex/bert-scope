This phenomenon occurs similarly to the pencils formed by doubly refracting crystals. Brewster also established a relationship between the number of plates and the angle of incidence at which the polarization occurs, and he explored the variations in these angles when changing the refractive power of the plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
