They aimed to determine osmotic pressures using the vapour pressure method and studied the validity of Dalton's law. The results showed that benzene, previously thought to be a non-associating vapour, is actually associated, and a new method was used to calculate the average molecular weights of the other vapours.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Equilibrium"}
