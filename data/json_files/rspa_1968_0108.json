They investigated the reaction between oxygen atoms and cyanogen and confirmed the previously proposed mechanism. The initial step has a rate constant, and CN radicals are mainly removed by reactions (4) and (2). The rates of reaction of CN with NO and other species were also measured.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
