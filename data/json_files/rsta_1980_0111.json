The research finds that the type of microstructure determines whether or not cracking occurs, and the extent of cracking depends on the type of microstructure. Coarse-grained regions with smooth boundaries are more resistant to cracking than partially or fully formed regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Welding and Materials Properties"}
