The model considers the plastic zone size and crack-tip displacement, which are essential for understanding ductile crack growth and fatigue crack growth. The results show that the plastic dissipation rate of energy is equal to the elastic energy release rate, making the energy criterion for crack growth inapplicable in this case.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
