They use a wave function constructed from different configurations and demonstrate that this method can be extended to other electronic systems. The study shows that two configurations, ls1 and ls2, representing radial and angular correlation, provide a satisfactory approximation to the polarizability of helium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
