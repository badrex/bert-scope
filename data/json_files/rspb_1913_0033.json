They found that the nature of the arterial wall, or its \"lability,\" has a significant impact on the conduction of pressure waves and the form of the sphygmogram. This can lead to variations in blood pressure readings and pulse curves, depending on the state of contraction of the arteries. In cases of aortic regurgitation, the systolic pressure readings for leg arteries are much higher than in arm arteries due to the difference in \"lability.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
