The results showed that above the conductivity maximum, thermal resistance is determined by the mutual interactions of phonons. Below the maximum, a true conductivity cannot be defined, and the values depend on the shape of the specimen. The findings also indicated that the proportion of specular reflexions at crystal boundaries can be as great as 40% and that some conclusions can be drawn about the imperfections causing discrepancies in conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
