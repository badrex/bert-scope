It explores the pathways and neurons involved in conveying visceral nociceptive messages to the spinal cord and the brain, and the differences between normal and abnormal pain experiences. The article highlights the importance of studying visceral nociception as a model for understanding the general functions of afferent C-fibres.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
