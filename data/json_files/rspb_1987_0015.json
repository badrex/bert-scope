The model predicts small trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements during regular stimulation and larger movements during non-steady-state stimulation. The simulations provide integrated explanations of electrical activity, contractile function, and trans-sarcolemmal calcium movements, which were beyond the scope of previous models.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Physiology"}
