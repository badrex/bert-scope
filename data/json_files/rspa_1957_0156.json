The study focuses on fatty acids as boundary lubricants and reveals the molecular arrangement in these monolayers. The research provides insights into the orientation of hydrocarbon chains and the lateral spacing of the chains in monolayers, which can help improve understanding of their properties and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
