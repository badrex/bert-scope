He observes the structure and function of their kidneys, ureters, and urinary receptacles, and analyzes the composition of their urine, which is primarily composed of uric acid. The study provides insights into the comparative anatomy and physiology of these animals' urinary systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
