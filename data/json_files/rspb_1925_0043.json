The research shows that the absence of boron leads to smaller and less developed nodules, while the presence of boron promotes healthy nodule growth. The findings suggest that boron plays a crucial role in plant growth and nodule development, and it may be beneficial for the entry of the nodule organism into the plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
