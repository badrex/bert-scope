The research shows that junctional receptor clusters increase in length with time when a nerve terminal is present, and that the development of new endplates reflects the development of new muscle cells. The findings also reveal that extra-junctional receptor clusters form by aggregating dispersed receptors and are not stable entities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
