The researchers found differences in the structure of movement and position sensitive cells, with position sensitive cells having staggered enveloping of dendrites and more extensive desmosome contacts. The findings provide insights into the physiological differences between movement and position sensitive units in the PD organ of Cancer pagurus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
