The study suggests that the sun is the source of ionization, with ultra-violet radiation being the most plausible cause. The author also discusses the connection between barometric and magnetic changes, and the importance of further research into the cosmical causes affecting the ionization of the upper atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
