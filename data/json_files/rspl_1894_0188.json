The Makariwa meteorite shows a close chemical relationship to the Montrejeau meteorite, with similarities in both silicate ratios and the proportion of olivine to enstatite. The proportion of nickel in the Makariwa meteorite's alloy is also higher than the average.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteoritics"}
