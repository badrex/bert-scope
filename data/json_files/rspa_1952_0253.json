The author explains the importance of chemical reactions between lubricants and metal surfaces, as well as the effect of temperature on the lubrication process. The article also highlights the differences between physically adsorbed and chemically formed layers, and the methods used to study surface damage and metal transference during sliding.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
