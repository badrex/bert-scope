They found that a single momentary stimulus applied to an afferent nerve often evokes a repetitive discharge of impulses from the reflex center. Additionally, they discovered that the reflex center can follow the rhythm of stimulation even at rates greater than 10 per second, contrary to previous observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
