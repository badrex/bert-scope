It discusses how scale invariance and fractal characteristics can be identified and illustrated in these systems, which exhibit universal critical behavior. The author also introduces scaling techniques, such as decimation and blocking, that have been developed for phase transitions and can be applied to fractals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
