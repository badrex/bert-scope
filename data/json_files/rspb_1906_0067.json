{"article_id": "rspb_1906_0067", "revised_title": "The Photolytic Decomposition of Carbon Dioxide and Its Role in Carbon Assimilation", "semantic_tags": ["Photosynthesis", "Carbon dioxide", "Formaldehyde", "Enzymes", "Catalase"], "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis", "tldr": "The authors conducted experiments to study the photolytic decomposition of carbon dioxide in green plants. They discovered that carbon dioxide is decomposed into formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide, which can be artificially induced under laboratory conditions. The process of carbon assimilation involves the use of enzymes, such as catalase, to break down hydrogen peroxide and produce oxygen. This research provides insights into the mechanism of photosynthesis and the role of enzymes in the process."}
