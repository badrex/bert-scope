The authors discuss the limitations of using terrestrial analogues and emphasize the importance of controlled cooling-rate experiments to understand the consolidation of lunar lavas and impact liquids. The findings provide new guidelines for interpreting crystallization on the lunar surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
