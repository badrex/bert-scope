The labrum is a soft lobe overhanging the mouth and plays a crucial part in the ingestion process. The research describes the labral skeleton, musculature, and innervation, as well as the labrum's movements during chewing and ingestion. The labrum's role in feeding is discussed, and its central position aids in guiding food into the oesophagus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
