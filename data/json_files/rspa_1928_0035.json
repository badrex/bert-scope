The author explains that hydrogen gas consists of two types of molecules, antisymmetrical and symmetrical, and that the laws of classical thermodynamics apply to the equilibrium properties of this mixture. The author also analyzes the known properties of hydrogen gas and applies this analysis to the specific heat curve at low temperatures and the vapour pressure equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
