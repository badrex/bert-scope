The authors combine the equations of motion, continuity, and magnetic induction to derive the exact nonlinear partial differential equation. They then compare the solution with the classical solution of Riemann, which describes pure finite-amplitude sound waves in a uniform atmosphere. The study shows that progressive magneto-acoustic waves of finite amplitude cannot propagate without change of type, and they can degenerate into shock waves. The effect of increasing the permanent magnetic field is found to decrease the time for the creation of the discontinuity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
