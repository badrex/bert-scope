They argue that these stars have different physical properties and temperatures, and that their classification should be based on these factors rather than just their cooling or heating states. The author compares the spectra of various stars, including 8 Cephei, 7 Cygni, and a Persei, and provides evidence for their distinct classifications.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
