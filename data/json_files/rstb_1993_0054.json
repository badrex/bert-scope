It explores various aspects of signaling systems, such as the structure and content of signals, and how the physical environment and conflicting selection pressures can influence them. The authors emphasize the importance of understanding these systems in a unified conceptual framework of signaling theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
