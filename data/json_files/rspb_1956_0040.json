{"article_id": "rspb_1956_0040", "revised_title": "Ecology and Gene Frequency Changes in Natural Populations", "semantic_tags": ["Population Genetics", "Evolutionary Ecology", "Gene Frequency", "Natural Selection", "Adaptation"], "tldr": "The article discusses the relationship between ecology and gene frequency changes in natural populations. It explores how gene substitutions can affect a population's adaptation to its environment and how changes in gene frequency can impact other species' populations. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these processes to bridge the gap between population genetics and ecology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
