Their findings provide a unique opportunity to test a model for small angular distortions of methylene groups in four-membered rings containing a heteroatom. The research also establishes the existence of a tilt and bend of the 3-methylene group.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy"}
