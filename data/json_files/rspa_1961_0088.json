The model uses the real projective plane outside a given conic to represent events, lines, and intervals. The author explores different scenarios of world lines, such as ultra-parallel, intersecting, and parallel, and analyzes the behavior of reflected light signals in each case.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geometry in physics"}
