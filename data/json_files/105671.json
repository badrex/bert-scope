He explains the process of computation used to calculate longitude from these observations and discusses the importance of accurate timekeeping and quadrant adjustments. Maskelyne also shares his experience with using a telescope and dark glass to observe the lunar distance and provides recommendations for future navigational instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
