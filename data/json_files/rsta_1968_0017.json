The authors evaluate existing criteria for noise exposure and suggest that as the duration of exposure becomes shorter, the ear becomes more tolerant to higher levels of noise. They also emphasize the importance of considering individual susceptibility and the need for further research on the relationship between exposure level and duration for equal auditory hazard.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Acoustics"}
