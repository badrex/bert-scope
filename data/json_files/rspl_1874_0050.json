They discovered that by connecting the battery to coil-accumulators, they could create well-defined stratifications in the vacuum tube. This phenomenon appeared to be caused by periodic overflows that interfered with the current waves, creating nodes of greater resistance in the medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
