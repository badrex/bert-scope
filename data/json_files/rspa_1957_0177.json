They show that the correlation is directly linked to the bunching of photons due to their indistinguishability and Bose-Einstein statistics. The phenomenon has applications in astronomy, such as measuring the apparent angular diameter of stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Radiation"}
