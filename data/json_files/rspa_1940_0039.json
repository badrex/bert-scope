The authors found that reciprocity failure disappears for all tested emulsions at sufficiently short exposure times. The point where the reciprocity curve bends over into the horizontal is always at the same exposure time of about 0.5 seconds, independent of the type of emulsion or density. The position of the bend-over point depends on temperature, shifting towards longer exposures as temperature decreases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
