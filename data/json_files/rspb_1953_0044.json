Foetal sera contain components corresponding to albumin, a-, /?- and y-globulin, but their proportions differ from both pregnant and non-pregnant adult rabbits. The research also explores the transfer of maternal proteins to the foetus and its implications for passive immunity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
