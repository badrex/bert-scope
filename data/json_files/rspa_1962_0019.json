It explores the relationship between light intensity, depth, and the distribution of planktonic algae, as well as the challenges in measuring photosynthesis and estimating the biomass of algae. The article also touches upon the role of zooplankton in the marine ecosystem and the need for further research in this area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
