The authors develop methods to measure temperature changes within 0.01 seconds and apply these techniques to reactions such as neutralization, carbonic acid with alkali, and bicarbonate with acid. They also explore buffering reactions of glycine and blood proteins, as well as the reaction between carbon monoxide and haemoglobin. The results have implications for understanding physiological and physicochemical processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
