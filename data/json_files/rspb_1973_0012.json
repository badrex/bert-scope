The researchers found that the outer layer of the chorion, which forms the interface between the parasite and its host, has long projections with embedded particles. This structure helps the egg evade the host's defense reactions. The study also reveals that the protective properties are acquired during the egg's passage through the calyx, a crucial site for the transformation of the oocyte.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
