The research focuses on understanding the effects of these vortices on the stability characteristics of the waves and how they can stabilize or destabilize the waves depending on their orientation. The findings can help improve the understanding of fluid flow instabilities and the development of laminar control wings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
