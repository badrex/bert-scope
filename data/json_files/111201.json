The author compares the density of gases and the line of density, illustrating the effects of temperature corrections on the accuracy of measurements. The study concludes that the differences between the two thermometers are significant and cannot be neglected in theoretical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
