It explores the relationship between sustainable yield, natural mortality, and the stock-recruitment relationship for both marine and terrestrial species. The study focuses on vertebrates, particularly mammals, and highlights the differences in density-dependent processes between marine and terrestrial systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
