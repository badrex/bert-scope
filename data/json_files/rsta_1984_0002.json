The model considers tidal and wind-driven components to calculate the mean circulation and accurately simulates the transport routes of the material. The model helps determine various time constants for the shelf seas, such as age, residence times, and turnover times, which differentiate regions of vigorous and stagnant water, indicating areas where thermal fronts may form.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
