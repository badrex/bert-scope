The mean ionization is subject to random variations that follow the Gauss law of errors, and the magnitude of an energy quantum is determined by the equation (AQ)\u00b2/ Q = 0.83 \u00d7 10\u207b\u00b9\u2076 Coulombs. This supports the validity of Planck's constant and the light quantum hypothesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
