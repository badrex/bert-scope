They analyze the equilibrium constants for reactions involving alkali metal atoms and electrons, finding that the values agree with Saha's theory. The study also explores the assumptions made in the calculations and their potential impact on the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Plasma Physics"}
