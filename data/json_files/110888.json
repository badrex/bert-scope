He found that transparent liquid streams become visible when vapors or fluids mix, and opaque deposits resembling clouds form on these streams. This phenomenon helps explain various cloud, film, and membranous formations resulting from different cohesive forces acting on liquid or gaseous bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Atmospheric Science"}
