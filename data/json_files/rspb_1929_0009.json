They discover that cytochrome and other haematin compounds are responsible for peroxidase reactions in various organisms, including bacteria, plants, and animals. The study also reveals that the presence of these compounds is often inhibited by reducing systems within cells, which can be overcome by heating or using specific reagents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
