The isolated nuclei were free from adherent cytoplasm, and the process maintained over 95% of the DNA and nuclear RNA. This method allowed for further analysis of the nuclei's composition and provided insights into the cells' structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
