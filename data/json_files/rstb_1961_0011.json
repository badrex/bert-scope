The research uses insect traps to collect data on insect numbers and analyzes the data alongside weather factors such as temperature, wind, and rainfall. The findings show that weather conditions can significantly impact insect populations, and the results can help in understanding and predicting insect outbreaks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
