They extend previous work on planar liquid-vapor interfaces and consider deformations of a fluid drop up to second order in density distortion. The study does not apply beyond the leading-order difference from the planar limit and does not identify the surface tension for general second-order surface deformations. Instead, the authors propose considering surface distortions that occur as natural fluctuations, such as hydrodynamic capillary waves, to define the surface tension of a drop.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
