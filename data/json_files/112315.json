He describes the bands as appearing ochraceous, or similar to the color of some ochraceous sands, and notes that they are not as dark as previously thought. He also mentions that the space between the equatorial bands appears bright white and silvery. Phillips compares the colors of Jupiter's bands to the supposed \"land\" of Mars and notes that there is no similar tint on the moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
