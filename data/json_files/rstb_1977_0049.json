The authors focus on the \"barrels\" in the somatosensory cortex, which are related to the mystacial vibrissae on the mouse's muzzle. They explain how these barrels can be affected by injuries to the whiskerpad and how this can impact the overall structure and function of the somatosensory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Somatosensory System"}
