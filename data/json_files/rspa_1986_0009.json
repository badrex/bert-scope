The study focuses on the non-Kramers doublet ground state of the thulium ion, which allows for the application of magnetic resonance crystallography techniques. The optical and magnetic properties of the compound are investigated through optical absorption spectroscopy, magnetic resonance, and magnetic susceptibility studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Lanthanide chemistry"}
