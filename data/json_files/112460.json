They recorded fluctuations in the spectrum, barometer, and thermometers during their journey. Their findings could help determine the effects of terrestrial gravity on the spectroscope's readings and provide valuable insights into the relationship between the barometer and the instrument.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
