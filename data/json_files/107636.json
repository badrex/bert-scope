They found that the difference of parallax between y Draconis and a Lyrae was zero, and the actual parallax of the star was a very small fraction of a second. The author discussed the advantages and disadvantages of different methods used in the investigation and considered the effects of temperature on the instruments and observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
