They discover that leucoline can be converted into aniline by heating it with potash-lime. This finding sheds light on the chemical relations between leucoline, aniline, and other nitrogen-containing compounds, and opens up possibilities for further research in the field of organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
