Ellery, describes the development and use of a pendulum-electrograph for continuous observation of atmospheric electricity. The device uses a divided-ring reflecting electrometer and a water-dropping collector to measure the electric state of the atmosphere. The author explains the design and components of the electrograph, including the reservoir of electricity, pendulum, electrodes, charge-measurer, lifting-cradle, and outer metallic cover. This improved electrograph provides more accurate and rapid measurements of atmospheric electricity, which can aid in weather and meteorological studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Meteorology"}
