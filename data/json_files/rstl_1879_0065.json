He discovered a constant dark space surrounding the negative pole, which he called the \"molecular disturbance.\" This phenomenon increased in thickness as the gas was rarefied. Crookes also observed similar effects with different gases and heating the metal pole. His findings suggest that the molecular disturbance is related to the concept of molecular pressure or stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
