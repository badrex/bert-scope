They found that the arrangement of hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups is a good predictor of binding strength, and that these recognition units can serve as the basis for constructing new synthetic hosts or self-assembling systems. The study also investigated the factors that control the stability of these complexes, such as geometry, acidity, and basicity of the hydrogen bond donor and acceptor groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Supramolecular Chemistry"}
