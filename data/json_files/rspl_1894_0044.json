They found that the primary cause of death is not due to the heart's failure but to the arrest of respiratory movements. Death can be prevented by artificial respiration, except under specific circumstances. The study also shows that the lateral pressures from the bullet cause mechanical damage to the respiratory center, which is the first to be affected by changes in intra-cranial tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology"}
