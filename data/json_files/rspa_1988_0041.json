The authors use a recently developed qualitative technique to analyze the behavior of these systems over their entire parameter space, finding various phase portraits and bifurcation diagrams. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the complex phenomena observed in isothermal chemical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
