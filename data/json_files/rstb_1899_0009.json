They discovered the main tracts, including the tractus septomesencephalicus, and described their connections and functions. The study also discussed the visual importance of birds, as well as the differences in the olfactory lobes and cerebral hemispheres. The authors used various staining methods and techniques to analyze the brain's structure and function, providing valuable insights into the bird's nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
