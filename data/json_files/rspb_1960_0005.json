They found that the acoustic structure of a sentence can alter the perception of a succeeding vowel sound, suggesting that an adaptation level for vowels is formed when listening to a particular speaker. The results support the adaptation level theory, which states that responses to stimuli are influenced by the context and previous experiences.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
