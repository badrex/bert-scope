The theory considers the interaction between centers and the response of localized electrons to an electric field, providing a practical solution for arbitrarily shaped polarizable centers randomly distributed in space. The results indicate that the interaction lowers the frequency range of the dispersion and can be applied to higher densities of polarizable centers than the Clausius-Mossotti formula."}
