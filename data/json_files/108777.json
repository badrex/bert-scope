The calorimeter allowed for the determination of the absolute amount of heat emanating from a surface under given conditions, providing a more accurate measurement than previous methods. This new instrument was simpler and more versatile, making it applicable to a wider range of surfaces and allowing for greater accuracy in determining the radiating powers of different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
