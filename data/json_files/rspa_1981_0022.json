It discusses the methods of comparing asteroid and meteorite measurements and the potential for identifying specific asteroids as possible parent bodies of meteorites. The study emphasizes the importance of spectrophotometry in identifying mineral assemblages and the challenges in interpreting asteroidal spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth and Environmental Sciences > Planetary Science"}
