The new design allows for better control of the initial volume, expansion ratio, and electric field, enabling the visualization of even the fastest beta-particles' tracks. The author also shares results obtained using the improved apparatus, including photographs of particle tracks and the effects of X-rays on the cloud chamber.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
