Born in Germany, he migrated to England in 1933 and spent his life working at University College London. Gruneberg's research focused on X-ray induced mutations, mouse genetics, and the use of mice as a model for human genetic defects. His work was supported by the Medical Research Council and the Rockefeller Foundation. Throughout his career, Gruneberg established a reputation as an authority on mammalian genetics and made important discoveries in the field."}
