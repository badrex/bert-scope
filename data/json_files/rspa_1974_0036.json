It explains how recombination can be precisely related to the flow of current through a network, with the potential of each point representing a level and the conductance of the link between levels determining the rate of recombination. The theorem is applicable to various types of recombination processes and provides a useful tool for understanding and analyzing recombination in different contexts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
