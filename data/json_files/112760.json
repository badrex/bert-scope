They discovered three supra-annual temperature cycles, with the most prominent having a period of 11 years, similar to Schwabe's numbers for solar spot groups. The author concludes that sunspots are not the cause of these temperature variations and suggests practical applications for understanding these cycles.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
