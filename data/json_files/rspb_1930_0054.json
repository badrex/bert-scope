They found that the most volatile fraction represents substances originally present in the mixture, while the substance with intense absorption at 290 is formed during distillation. The authors also described a method for the partial separation of irradiation products, obtaining a crystalline product with high antirachitic power.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
