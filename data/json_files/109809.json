He discovered that iodine forms compounds with oxygen, alkaline earths, and other elements, and discussed the properties and potential applications of these compounds. Davy also investigated the possibility of obtaining iodine from sea-weeds and sea-water, but was unsuccessful in his attempts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
