The authors developed a method using potassium iodide solution to distinguish ozone from other substances like oxides of nitrogen and hydrogen peroxide. They found that ozone occurs in small quantities at high altitudes and is formed by the action of ultra-violet light on oxygen. The authors also studied the effect of ultra-violet light on air to understand the concentration of ozone and other products that can be formed under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
