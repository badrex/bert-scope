He created an apparatus called a \"columnar machine\" that produced continuous electric shocks. This invention, now known as the Voltaic Pile, paved the way for further research in electricity and its applications. Volta also found that this apparatus could affect the senses of touch, taste, sight, and hearing, opening up new fields of study for scientists.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
