The ground state of terbium is found to be an almost degenerate doublet, and the optical absorption spectrum of terbium near 485 nm is analyzed. The temperature-independent magnetic susceptibility and the quadratic Zeeman effect in the low field limit are also studied, confirming a non-magnetic (singlet) ground state for terbium in this material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
