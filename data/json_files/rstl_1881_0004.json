They analyze the effects of varying external magnetic systems on the plates and shells, and discuss the conditions required for electric potential to vanish. The study provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of electric currents and their applications in various conductive materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
