They discovered that each touch causes a small movement in the leaf, and these movements gradually increase until the leaf closes. The researchers also found that the delay between excitation and the leaf's response decreases as the extent of the response increases, suggesting that summation occurs in the plant, similar to animal physiology. This study provides insights into the plant's defense mechanisms and its ability to respond to stimuli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
