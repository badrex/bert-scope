The author proposes an improved criterion for identifying these curve types and demonstrates their application to actual statistical data. The new curve types provide a more comprehensive understanding of frequency distributions and contribute to the study of evolutionary theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mathematical Statistics"}
