These waves cause secondary 'explosive' failures in the fibers, resulting in a cloud of particulate matter. The research provides insights into the fragmentation process of high-strength glass fibers and the role of flexural waves in their failure.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
