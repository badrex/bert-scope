They found that a slight increase in initial passive stretch significantly enhanced the response, both in reflexes and direct motor stimulation. The study also showed that the process of recovery after strenuous exertion is complete within 90 minutes, with a slight displacement of the respiratory quotient implying the oxidation of slightly less carbohydrate and more fat.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
