The author, G. I. Taylor, demonstrates that at slow speeds, the motion is always stable, but at high speeds, stability depends on the ratio of the outer cylinder's speed to the inner one. When the ratio is below a certain value, the motion becomes unstable. The article also describes experiments verifying the theoretical predictions and provides insights into the breakdown of initial symmetrical instability before the liquid becomes turbulent.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
