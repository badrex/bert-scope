They used three extrapolation techniques to determine the spontaneous magnetization and found that the results agreed with Neel's theory of ferrimagnetism. The study also investigated the behavior of the materials in the Curie point region and their magnetization properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
