The authors identify various regulatory sequences and mechanisms involved in histone gene expression, including the role of chromosomal components and RNA processing. They also discover a DNA segment within the mRNA coding body of the H2B gene that is implicated as a site of action for the H2B stimulatory factor. The complex regulatory features of histone gene expression are based on a plurality of sequences lying 5', 3', and internal to the gene.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
