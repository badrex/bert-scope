They discovered a remarkable phenomenon called the 'chain-effect,' where the polymerization rate is significantly faster than expected. The chain-effect is explained by adsorption of the monomer by the polysarcosine chain, leading to a high collision frequency between the polymer terminal group and the monomer molecules. The authors also found that the chain-effect can occur in various systems involving polymer reactions and has similarities to enzymic reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
