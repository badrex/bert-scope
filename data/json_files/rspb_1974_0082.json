This hypothesis is supported by the distribution of races in the butterfly genus Heliconius, which closely coincides with the distribution of species and subspecies in birds and reptiles. The study of Heliconius butterflies helps to understand the role of climatically induced forest refuges in the evolution of tropical species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
