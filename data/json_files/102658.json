They discuss the work of Mr. John Perks, Dr. David Gregory, and Mr. John Caswell, who each contributed to the development of this method. The authors demonstrate how this technique can be applied to other similar shapes and discuss the relationship between different types of curves and figures.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
