They discovered that different types of corals have distinct septal structures, which are composed of fibro-crystalline aragonite deposits called fascicles. These fascicles form the building blocks of the coral skeleton, giving rise to the diverse shapes and forms found in the Madreporaria family. The author also investigated the growth patterns and processes of corals, including the role of synapticulae in providing support for the polyps.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Coral Biology"}
