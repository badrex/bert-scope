He used various methods, including observing the moon's transit, occultations, and eclipses of Jupiter's satellites. Pigott's findings helped improve the accuracy of determining longitude and contributed to the development of better methods for future astronomers.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Geodesy"}
