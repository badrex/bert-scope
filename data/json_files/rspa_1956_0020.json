They found that the conductivity of solid solutions is greater than that of pure solvents, and the activation energy of impurities is approximately equal to the calculated triplet state energies of free molecules. This research contributes to understanding the electronic structure and properties of aromatic hydrocarbons in the solid phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
