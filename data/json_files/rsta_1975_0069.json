The observations provide information about the composition and properties of the interstellar gas in the line of sight and useful data on stellar atmospheres. The authors analyze the interstellar absorption lines and discuss the implications of their findings on the understanding of the interstellar medium and stellar properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
