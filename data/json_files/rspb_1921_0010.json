This process, called \"intertraction,\" can be observed in various types of receptacles and is influenced by the concentration of salt and albuminous substances. The author also discusses the potential applications of these findings in wound healing and infection treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
