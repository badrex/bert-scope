The authors describe the pre-collision ophiolite obduction phase, continental collision stage, and post-collision stage, detailing the various types of thrusts and their effects on the area. They also discuss the geological framework, the Ladakh batholith, and the timing of deformation in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
