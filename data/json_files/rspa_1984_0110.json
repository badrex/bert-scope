The authors derive early, intermediate, and late asymptotic solutions to describe the etching process, providing insights into the behavior of the moving surface and the diffusion field. These solutions help in understanding the evolution of the etched profile during the entire etching process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics and Heat Transfer"}
