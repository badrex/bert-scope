It discusses the persistence of oil in low-energy coastal environments and the factors that influence its bioavailability to infauna. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the potential long-term consequences and effects of oil pollution on the marine environment, including potential effects due to metabolites formed through chemical reactions or biotransformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
