The study provides a complete classification of these invariant Poisson structures and proves the instability of their compatibility property. This research contributes to the understanding of bi-Hamiltonian systems and the properties of compatible pairs of Poisson structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Symplectic Geometry"}
