S. D. Maunder describes her observations and photographs of the total solar eclipse of May 18, 1901, in Mauritius. She used various instruments and cameras to capture images of the corona, chromosphere, and prominences during the eclipse. The photographs provide valuable information about the structure and extension of the corona, as well as the behavior of the polar rays and coronal rays. The observations were made using different types of lenses and cameras, and the images captured are an important contribution to the study of solar eclipses and the solar corona.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
