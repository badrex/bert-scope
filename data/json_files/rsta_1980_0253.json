The system is tested with a train of laser pulses and then applied to record Cerenkov radiation produced by a beam of particles. The Synchroscan method is further developed into a commercially available accessory for the Imacon 675 streak camera, enabling the study of fluorescence and other luminous phenomena on a picosecond time scale.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics and Photonics"}
