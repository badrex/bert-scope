The researchers found a significant correlation between the growth and secretory activity of the seminal vesicles and the diameter of the seminiferous tubules in bull testes. The mean diameter of the seminiferous tubules increased with age and was related to the differentiation of the seminiferous epithelium and the androgenic activity of the testes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Physiology"}
