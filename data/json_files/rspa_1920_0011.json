They found that ionisation occurs when the electron velocity reaches 9-10 volts, and radiation production begins at around 14-16 volts. The results provide insights into the energy levels needed for electron interactions with argon gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
