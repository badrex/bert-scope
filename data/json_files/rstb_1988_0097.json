It reviews the history of genetic studies related to the disease and their implications for understanding family clustering and transmission patterns. The author highlights the importance of HLA-DR alleles in mediating T-cell reactions in conjunction with antigens of Mycobacterium leprae, but the epidemiological implications of this work are not yet clear. The article also emphasizes the need to consider genetic mechanisms that may differ within and between populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Disease"}
