The authors demonstrate that radiolytic and photolytic polymerization initiate and progress uniformly in the bulk and surface regions of the crystal, respectively, and that dislocations do not act as nuclei for the reaction. The study provides insights into the mechanisms and kinetics of solid-state reactions in diacetylenes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
