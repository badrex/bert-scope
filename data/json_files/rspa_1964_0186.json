They found that when exposed to radiation, Ni ions trap electrons and form ions associated with various vacancy configurations. The study describes the annealing behavior of these complexes in room temperature and low-temperature irradiated crystals, as well as the symmetry of the complexes and their ground states. The fluorine hyperfine structure of the spectra is also investigated, providing insights into the environment of the Ni ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
