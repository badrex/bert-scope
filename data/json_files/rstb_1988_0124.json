The research reveals the development of woodland, heath, and blanket peat over time, as well as the impact of human activities on the local vegetation. The findings provide insights into the three-dimensional vegetation history and the role of human influences on the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoenvironmental reconstruction"}
