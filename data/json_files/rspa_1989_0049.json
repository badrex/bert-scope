The Fractal BET theory is suitable for mass and surface fractals, while the FHH theory is more suitable for surface fractals. The study shows that the two theories have different asymptotic behaviors at high coverage and that the Fractal BET theory is sensitive to multiple-wall effects. The findings provide a better understanding of the thermodynamic behavior of adsorbed films on fractal surfaces, which is essential for various scientific and technological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
