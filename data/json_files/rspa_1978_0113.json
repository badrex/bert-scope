The model provides reliable estimates of the parameters in the spin Hamiltonian, aiding in identifying radicals, their geometry, and electronic structure. The study focuses on radicals with one unpaired electron in a non-degenerate state and considers interactions such as the g-tensor, hyperfine interaction tensor, and quadrupole interaction tensor.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
