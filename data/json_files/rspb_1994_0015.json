It found that genetic similarity in red squirrels is inversely correlated with population size, and the loss of genetic variation and lower population densities in isolated populations are due to reduced immigration. The results suggest that population processes, rather than genetic problems, are the real threat to small squirrel populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Conservation Biology"}
