They analyzed samples from liquid air residues and found two previously undiscovered isotopes of xenon but no evidence of a heavier element in the range of 210-230 atomic weight. This research improved the understanding of atomic number and the periodic law, narrowing the search for a heavier element in the atmosphere."}
