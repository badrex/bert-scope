The model uses a local synaptic learning rule and incorporates adaptive features, allowing it to integrate signals and perform eye movements accurately. The network can recover from lesions and hemilabyrinthectomy, and its units carry a variety of combinations of eye position and velocity signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neural Networks"}
