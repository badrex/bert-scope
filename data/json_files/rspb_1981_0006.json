The research focuses on the role of macrophages in removing and breaking down the carcinogen, which is essential for understanding the host's reaction to transformed cells and early stages of chemical carcinogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Immunology"}
