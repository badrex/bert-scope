The researchers found that an IL-3-dependent precursor B-cell line, LyD9, can differentiate into mature B cells and myeloid cells when co-cultured with bone marrow stromal cells. Additionally, an IL-4-dependent clone, K-4, was established, which serves as an intermediate in the differentiation process from LyD9 to B cells and myeloid cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
