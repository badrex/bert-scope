They develop a method to determine the true dip by analyzing the mean of the apparent dips in different positions and reversing the magnetism of the needle. The author plans to test this method further to determine if the true dip can be accurately measured with a single needle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
