The authors analyze Proca's field equations and show that by extending them to the interior of matter, the discontinuity between Maxwell's limiting case and a finite rest mass can be avoided. They argue that a finite rest mass would result in a third state of polarization for electromagnetic waves, which could affect the heating and pressure effects of black-body radiation. However, they conclude that the current findings indicate that we are not faced with the limiting case of rest-mass zero, and a more in-depth analysis of the interaction between matter and the mysterious vector field is needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
