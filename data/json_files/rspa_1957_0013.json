The authors extend McKoen's method to obtain a complex equation defining a neutral curve with two branches and a least critical Reynolds number. They apply this method to the stability of a laminar jet and find a critical Reynolds number for instability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
