The author proposes an abstract definition of a quantum mechanical switch and applies it to sodium channel proteins in the brain. The study discusses the implications of quantum mechanics on information processing and unpredictability in the brain, aiming to provide a better understanding of the relationship between consciousness and the physical world.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
