By measuring the distances and angles between the comet and stars, he determined the comet's right ascension and declination. These observations provided valuable data for understanding the comet's trajectory and helped confirm the accuracy of the theory of gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational astronomy"}
