They argue that the idea was slow to be accepted due to a focus on differential growth and the assumption that localized mitosis was the primary morphogenetic mechanism. The author traces the development of the cell theory and the study of cell locomotion, highlighting key figures and milestones in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
