The authors discuss the importance of Nd and Pb isotopes in determining the source of magma and the processes responsible for magmagenesis. They also highlight the role of isotopic analysis in revealing terrane boundaries and the growth of continental crust through terrane accretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
