The study uses a simplified model of a semi-infinite homogeneous electron plasma with a sharp lower boundary to calculate the power absorbed per unit volume of the ionospheric plasma. The results show that the interference patterns and absorbed power depend on the height, range, and direction of the incident waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
