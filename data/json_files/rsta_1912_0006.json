The results show that the temperature decreases steadily up to a height of about 10-11 km, then remains nearly constant with a small increase at 7-8 km, before dropping abruptly. The study also compares the findings with similar research conducted on the Continent and Russia.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
