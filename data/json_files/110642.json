He discovered that sugar is not made up of carbon and water only, and during fermentation, water is decomposed. Rigg also found that alcohol and carbonic acid are not the only products of this process, and that fermented liquors have valuable qualities due to unique compounds formed during fermentation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
