The authors conducted experiments on various trees, such as sycamore, birch, and walnut, and examined the impact of environmental factors on sap movement. They also explored the potential use of barometers and thermometers to monitor these changes and the possibility of using their findings to predict climate, soil, and fruitfulness.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Tree Physiology"}
