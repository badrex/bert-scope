The research combines field studies and a literature survey to understand the processes of windprune, windsnap, windtilt, and windthrow. The findings reveal that strong winds during the mid Flandrian period blew chiefly from N.N.W. to S.S.E., with a wider range of directions than the contemporary wind regime.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
