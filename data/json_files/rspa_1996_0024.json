The model uses novel finite volume unstructured mesh techniques and is applied to predict shape deformation and porosity formation in solidifying metal components. The research aims to develop computational tools for the foundry industry to design casting processes and improve casting quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Metallurgy"}
