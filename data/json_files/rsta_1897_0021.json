The author aims to determine the work expended in raising the temperature of ice-cold water to boiling point and establish a physically constant ratio between work and heat. The research offers a new method for comparing the scale of pressure of gas at constant volume with the scale of air pressures, providing a more accurate measurement of heat in mechanical units.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
