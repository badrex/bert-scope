It describes the morphological specializations and the complex skeleto-muscular system, which are crucial for locomotion and feeding. The research also covers the development of other structures, such as the mouthparts, trunk limbs, and endoskeleton, as the organism grows.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
