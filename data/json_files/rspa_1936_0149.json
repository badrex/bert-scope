They discuss the relationship between the scale of turbulence and the critical resistance of spheres, concluding that the critical Reynolds number depends on the ratio of the sphere's diameter to the scale of turbulence. The theory is supported by experimental observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
