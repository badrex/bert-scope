The study explores the bending, buckling, and curling behavior of the plate under a uniform temperature gradient through its thickness. The research provides insights into the preferred direction of curling, asymmetrical buckling, and snap-through buckling, as well as the effects of initial principal curvatures and temperature gradients on the plate's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
