They analyze the isothermal criticality at the second ignition limit and explain the oscillatory phenomenon through kinetic relationships. Analytical predictions of the periods between oscillatory ignitions and the conditions for oscillatory ignition are made. The experimental observations reveal novel features of very lean hydrogen and oxygen mixtures near the second ignition limit.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
