They found that pressure accelerates the reactions by about ten times at 3000 kg/cm\u00b2, due to an increase in the probability factor. The results show that the pressure effect varies from case to case, with a greater acceleration when there is more steric hindrance. The reaction between isopropyl iodide and dimethylaniline showed the greatest acceleration, with the velocity increasing until it was 500 times greater than at atmospheric pressure at 12,000 kg/cm\u00b2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
