The authors designed a measuring device to directly measure the variations in the rotor's deflection and vibration, providing valuable information for understanding and improving the dynamic behavior of rotating shafts in industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
