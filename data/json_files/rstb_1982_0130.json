The authors describe their experiments with Dictyostelium amoebae, which revealed that actin filaments are stable and have a low critical concentration for polymerization. They also found that myosin thick-filament formation is regulated by phosphorylation. The results provide insights into the transient nature of filamentous assemblies in non-muscle cells and the role of accessory proteins in controlling actin and myosin assembly.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
