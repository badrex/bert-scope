They find that the tetrahedral field partially removes the degeneracy of the energy levels and splits them into different types. The authors also provide methods for solving the Schr\u00f6dinger equation for the diatomic molecule, considering both large and small field strengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Molecular Physics"}
