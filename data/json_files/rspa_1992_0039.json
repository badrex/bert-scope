They discuss the time-dependent formalism, the Wigner-Weyl correspondence, and the semiclassical corrections associated with classical periodic orbits. This work contributes to the understanding of quantum chaology and the relationship between quantum and classical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
