The author explains how the pressure created by the diaphragm affects the blood flow in the veins and arteries, and how this pressure balances the suction-action of the chest during inspiration. The author also explores the impact of various body movements on abdominal circulation and the movement of fluids in the abdomen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
