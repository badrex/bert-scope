The authors use the Fourier-splitting technique and iteration method to analyze the nonlinear term and obtain decay estimates for the solutions. The results provide insights into the behavior of magnetohydrodynamics systems and can be applied to other nonlinear evolution equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Partial Differential Equations"}
