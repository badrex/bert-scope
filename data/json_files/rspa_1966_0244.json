They found that quantum corrections, such as frequency changes due to rotational Raman scattering and changes in molecular polarizability with rotational state, significantly affect the depolarization ratios. These corrections help improve the understanding of molecular properties and their interactions with light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
