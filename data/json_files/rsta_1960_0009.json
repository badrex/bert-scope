They determined specific heat at constant volume, pressure coefficient at constant volume, and pressure as a function of temperature at constant volume (isochores) for a range of densities. Using these measurements, they calculated the entropy, internal energy, enthalpy, free energy, Gibbs function, and specific heat at constant pressure for all single-phase states within the experimental range. This comprehensive study provides valuable data for understanding the behavior of helium at low temperatures and high pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
