High-resolution serial photomicrography reveals precise and uniform patterns of fiber projections between the retina, lamina, and medulla in all species. The findings suggest that the visual fields of insects are exactly projected upon the lamina and medulla, with no lateral interactions between pathways with different visual axes. This uniformity of projection patterns can be correlated with different modes of axon growth during optic lobe neurogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
