They concluded that Haramiya and Thomasia were likely upper and lower teeth, respectively, and discussed their possible relationships to multituberculates and other mammalian groups. The study provides insights into the evolution and classification of early mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalian Paleobiology"}
