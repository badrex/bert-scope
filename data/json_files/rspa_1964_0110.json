Explosions", "semantic_tags": ["Blast wave physics", "Air velocity", "Shock waves", "T.N.T. explosions", "High-speed cameras"], "tldr": "This article presents a technique for measuring air velocity in blast waves from T.N.T. explosions using high-speed cameras and smoke trails. The initial decay of velocity behind the shock agrees well with theoretical predictions, but an extended outward flow is observed, which is attributed to the \"after-burning\" of detonation products in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. The velocity decay within a T.N.T. blast wave is described by an equation fitted to data using an iterative least squares procedure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
