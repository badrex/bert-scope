Instead, the proposed method utilizes the elastic and plastic load-deformation characteristics of frames, including second-order effects. The theoretical validity of the method is studied, and comparisons are made with experimental observations on frames loaded proportionally up to collapse.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
