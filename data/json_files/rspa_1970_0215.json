They used these measurements in conjunction with an extended technique to determine binary diffusion coefficients at elevated temperatures. The results provide valuable insights into the interaction forces between carbon dioxide and nitrogen molecules and help predict high-temperature values of binary diffusion coefficients with a few percent accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
