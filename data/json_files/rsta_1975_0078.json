They analyze the resonance lines of various ions in these stars and find that they exhibit characteristic P-Cygni profiles, indicating the ejection of material from the stars. The study provides insights into the behavior of hot stars and their spectral properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Stellar Spectroscopy"}
