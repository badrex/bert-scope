They discover that the majority of negative ions are formed by a new process, rather than the previously presumed processes of radiative or dissociation. The study provides insights into the energy distribution and formation mechanisms of negative ions, with implications for understanding gas physics and atomic and molecular interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
