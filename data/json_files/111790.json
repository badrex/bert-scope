Frankland, studied the properties and reactions of zincethyl, a compound formed by the action of zinc on iodide of ethyl. Zincethyl is a highly reactive and electropositive compound that forms double decompositions with other elements. It is spontaneously flammable in atmospheric air or oxygen and reacts with various elements like iodine, bromine, chlorine, and sulfur. The study of zincethyl's behavior provides insights into the condition of bodies during chemical change and supports the idea of moleculesymmetrical form of organometallic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
