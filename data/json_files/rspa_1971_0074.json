The model takes into account fuel consumption and provides a more realistic representation of cool-flame phenomena, offering a better understanding of the underlying thermokinetic oscillations and self-quenching mechanisms. This study contributes to the development of controlled synthesis routes for organic chemicals and the monitoring of fuel octane numbers in refinery streams.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
