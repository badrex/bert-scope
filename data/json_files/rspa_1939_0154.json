They found two groups of alpha-particles emitted, which led to the formation of an isotope of sodium and an excitation level in the 21Ne nucleus. They also discovered four groups of protons emitted, which indicated the presence of excitation levels in the 24Na nucleus. The authors determined the masses of 23Na, 24Na, and 24Mg from their observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
