They found that the bond dissociation energy changes depending on the nature and position of the substituent in the benzene ring. This research helps to understand the reactivity of aromatic compounds and the effect of substituents on chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
