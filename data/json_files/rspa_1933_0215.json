They discovered that these quinonoid compounds undergo termolecular polymerization, forming stable and insoluble crystalline structures. The authors also discussed the differences in the polymerization processes of benzoquinone, toluquinone, and \u03b1-naphthoquinone, and the properties of the resulting termolecular compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
