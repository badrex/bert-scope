The author reconstructs the flexural rigidity and density functions of the beam from data associated with natural frequencies of vibration. The study focuses on the unique non-singular beam without a back and presents a method to construct the beam using auxiliary equations and fundamental solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
