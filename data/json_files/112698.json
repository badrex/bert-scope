The author, Robert H. Scott, investigates the relationship between the polar and equatorial currents and their impact on the atmosphere. He found that these currents often lead to significant weather changes, such as barometrical depressions and southerly storms. Although the exact formation of storms was not observed, the study provides valuable insights into the deep-seated disturbances of the atmosphere and the potential for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
