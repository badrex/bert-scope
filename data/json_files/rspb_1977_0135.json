The results show that both ionophores cause vasoconstriction and inhibit renin release, with A23187 showing a more significant effect. The effects are calcium-dependent, supporting the link between renin release, renal vasoconstriction, and calcium flux.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
