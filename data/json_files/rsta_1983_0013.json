The research focuses on the higher frequency bands of internal waves and investigates the role of wind stress, horizontal and vertical shear, surface waves, near-inertial waves, and small-scale turbulence and mixing in the energy balance. The findings provide insights into the dynamics of internal waves and their interactions with the ocean and atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
