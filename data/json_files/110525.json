The method involves observing the transit of stars over a horizontal wire and recording their positions in a diagram. The author has successfully determined the right ascension and declination of 600 stars using this method and has also proposed a system of symbols to express the relative magnitude of stars in his catalog. Additionally, he suggests that there may be a general law of position in stars, where each star has a corresponding one in the opposite meridian.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
