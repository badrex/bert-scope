The author describes a series of experiments to determine the corrections needed for temperature differences and compares the results with a formula derived from the hypothesis of two magnetic poles near the Earth's center. The author praises Captain Back's dedication to scientific exploration in challenging conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
