They found total and absorption cross-sections of 164 mb and 98 mb, respectively. The results agree with values obtained by extrapolating known cross-sections for more complex nuclei and are interpreted in terms of the optical model of the nucleus. The angular distribution for elastic scattering yields an alpha-particle radius of 1.8 fm, and the study shows that the alpha-particle has some individual particle characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
