The authors present a method for solving the integral equations derived in their previous paper and calculate various physically interesting quantities, such as the variation of energy capture by the duct and the asymmetric radiation pattern from an incident duct mode. They also provide a simple heuristic approximation for the scattering problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
