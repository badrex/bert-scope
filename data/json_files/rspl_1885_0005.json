The kinetic energy of a gas is divided into several parts, including the kinetic energy of irrotationally moving fluid, rotationally moving fluid, and translational velocity of the vortex core. The author also explores the distribution of coordinates and momenta among molecules during collisions, showing that the distribution remains steady.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
