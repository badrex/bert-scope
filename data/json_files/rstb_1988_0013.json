Bracken causes direct loss of grazing land, is poisonous to livestock, and affects wildlife conservation. The author explores the possibility of biological control using exotic insects from the Southern Hemisphere, describing potential control agents and the constraints and opportunities of this approach. Additionally, the article highlights the need to consider legal, political, environmental, and socio-economic factors before attempting biological control.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
