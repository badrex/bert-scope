The research focuses on the Soar and Nene valleys, analyzing sedimentary architecture, radiocarbon dating, and the influence of soil development and sub-aerial processes on floodplain evolution. The findings suggest that new process-based interpretations of floodplain stratigraphy and models of floodplain evolution may be needed to understand the changing Lateglacial and Flandrian climate of lowland UK.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
