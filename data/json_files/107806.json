Faraday describes his experiments with naphthaline and sulphuric acid, leading to the production of a new acid. He explains the properties and reactions of this new acid, as well as the process of obtaining it in a pure form. This discovery expanded the understanding of acid chemistry and the interactions between different compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid Chemistry"}
