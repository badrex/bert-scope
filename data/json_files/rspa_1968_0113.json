It provides a method to derive approximate formulae for explosion time in various scenarios, such as constant surface temperature, surface flux, convective surface heat transfer, and more. The author also discusses the general explosion criteria and provides examples of specific cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
