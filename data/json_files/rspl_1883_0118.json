They explain how surface layers exert tension or pressure on any material wall and how this leads to the phenomena of capillarity. They also discuss the difference in density near the surface and the interior of the fluid, and how this affects the equilibrium of a fluid in contact with a solid. The authors explore various scenarios, including the contact of two fluids, a fluid and its vapor, and a fluid and a solid, to demonstrate the surface forces at play.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
