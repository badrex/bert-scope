They observed that the crystal exhibited slip bands and fatigue cracks, with four distinct zones where no slip bands were detected. The findings provide insights into the mechanism of deformation and failure of metals under torsional stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fatigue and Fracture"}
