They found that the refractivity of a compound can be either greater or lesser than the sum of its constituents' refractivities, and the dispersive power often varies significantly compared to the refractive power. The study provides insights into the behavior of gases and their compounds, contributing to the understanding of their optical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
