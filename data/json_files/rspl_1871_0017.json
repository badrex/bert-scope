They found that only 14 out of 132 substances were dissolved by liquid cyanogen, and none exhibited strong chemical action. The author also studied the reactions of fluoride of silver with different compounds, including iodine fluoride, argentic fluoride, and paracyanogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
