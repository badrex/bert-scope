They applied this theory to the process of differential Rayleigh scattering of circularly polarized light, calculating differential scattered intensities and analyzing their near- and far-zone behavior. The study has implications for understanding the optical properties of chiral molecules and systems with dissymmetric chromophore arrangements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
