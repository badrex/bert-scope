The geological setting and principal results of the drilling are discussed, focusing on the history of rifting and subsidence on these margins and their relation to the sea floor spreading history of the adjacent ocean basins. The findings provide insights into the nature of unconformities at passive margins and anoxic episodes during the Lower Cretaceous."}
