It explores the size-dependent development of band structure and optical properties in nanocrystals, as well as the use of near-field optical microscopy to measure optical properties on a nanoscale. The author presents examples of direct gap CdSe and indirect gap Si nanocrystals, and demonstrates how these materials exhibit unique optical properties due to quantum confinement and three-dimensional quantum confinement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
