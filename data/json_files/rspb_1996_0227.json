Contrary to expectations, the minnows did not modify their behavior or leave the area when exposed to the extract. This suggests that the minnow's fright reaction is context-dependent and raises doubts about the hypothesis that Schreckstoff is an alarm pheromone.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
