He concludes that the arrangement of coal fields into basins is due to the intersection of flexures and denudation acting along anticlinal arches. The author's hypothesis regarding the Earth's crust is supported by pendulum observations, suggesting that the variety in the elevation and depression of the Earth's surface is due to unequal contraction in the solidification process.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
