This risk grows exponentially with time to reach cover, which can explain why birds tend to forage close to protective cover. The research supports the idea that predation risk is an accelerating function of time to reach cover, even when considering factors like distance from cover and changes in prey behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
