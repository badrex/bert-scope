They apply this method to various electronic states of the hydrogen molecule and the hydrogen molecular ion, and explain anomalies in previous calculations. The study highlights the importance of using floating functions and the electrostatic theorem for accurate molecular energy calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
