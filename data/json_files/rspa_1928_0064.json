They found that the molecules possess at least two-fold symmetry and that the unit cell contains four molecules. The study also revealed that the molecules have a plane of symmetry, which indicates that they have a face-centered arrangement. The authors discuss various space groups and molecular symmetries that could be associated with the studied compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
