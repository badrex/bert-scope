The calcification process involves a complex, acidic polysaccharide that binds calcium ions specifically and interferes with the crystallization of calcium carbonate. The structure and composition of coccoliths are discussed, as well as the role of the polysaccharide in the calcification process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
