The researchers found that after 24 hours of development, individual motoneurons can fire multiple impulses per cycle, contributing to the development of ventral root bursts. Additionally, the complexity of the synaptic drive underlying swimming increases dramatically in stage 42 larvae, suggesting a developmental change in the membrane properties of rhythmically active neurons as a major factor in the post-embryonic development of swimming in Xenopus larvae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
