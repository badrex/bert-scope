The research focuses on the motion of wings and bodies, providing insights into flight behavior and maneuverability. The authors describe a projection analysis technique that can be applied to various types of flight, enabling a better understanding of the control mechanisms involved in insect flight.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
