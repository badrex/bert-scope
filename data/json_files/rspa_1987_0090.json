They used high-speed image converter cameras and a 600 MHz digital analyzer to study the breakdown process. The results showed that the breakdown mechanism in short gaps in SF6 is similar to that observed in atmospheric air gaps of several meters in length. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of leader formation in SF6, which is important for understanding the failure of practical SF6-insulated systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
