They establish an existence-uniqueness theorem for these waves and develop a method to determine the displacement field and traction on planes parallel to the boundary. The study focuses on homogeneous, anisotropic elastic materials and provides a foundation for further research on surface waves in more complex materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
