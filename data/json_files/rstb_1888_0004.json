They argue that the theories commonly accepted for mammalian and reptilian embryology do not apply to birds. The author provides detailed descriptions of the arterial system in birds, including the common carotid, subclavian, and vertebral arteries, and discusses the differences between bird and mammal arterial development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate anatomy"}
