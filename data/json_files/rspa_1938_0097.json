They found that the photosensitivity of this substance is high in the near ultraviolet range, and the quantum efficiency is about the same as other substances. The method of photometric curves can be used to examine photochemical reactions and determine the photosensitivity, making it an essential tool in photochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
