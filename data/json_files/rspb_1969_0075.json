They isolated and characterized heterozygous diploids of the slime mould, which suggested the existence of a para-sexual cycle. This finding expanded our understanding of the complex life cycle of Dictyostelium discoideum and its genetic processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Cytology"}
