The author finds that the naphthene fraction increases with temperature when both liquid and vapour are present, but decreases with temperature when only vapour is present. The naphthene fraction also increases with pressure when only vapour is present. The author also discusses the effect of temperature and pressure on the equilibrium amount of aromatic hydrocarbons like benzene.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Equilibrium and Reaction Thermodynamics"}
