He discovered that the coefficient of viscosity is independent of density and increases with temperature. The results agreed with the Dynamical Theory of Gases and the experiments of Mr. Graham on gas transpiration. Maxwell also found that the coefficient of viscosity of hydrogen is much less than that of air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
