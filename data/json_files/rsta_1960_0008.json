They also discuss the limiting case of diffusion and compare it with the distribution proposed by Fisher. The problem is extended to general Riemannian manifolds, showing that commutability does not hold in general but does hold in completely harmonic spaces and some others.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Probability Theory"}
