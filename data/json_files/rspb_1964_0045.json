Using electron microscopy, the researchers found organelles with interconnected tubules that accumulate secretory material in the preterminal portions of neurosecretory fibers. These findings support the hypothesis that secretory material assembles within mitochondria or their derivatives in the preterminal portions of neurosecretory fibers, and that the distal part of a neurosecretory system plays an active role in hormone transformation or assemblage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
