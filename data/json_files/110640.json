He discovers that the action of the battery is not proportional to the surfaces of the conducting hemispheres and that the circulating force increases with the surface of the conducting plates. The battery produces a flame with intense radiant heat and light, which can cause inflammation and damage to the eyes. The phenomenon of the transfer of charcoal from one electrode to another is observed, and the flame is attracted or repelled by the poles of a magnet.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
