They tested the specimens under reversed flexural, torsional, and combined flexural and torsional stresses using a new testing machine. The results showed that the differences in stress factors for the specimens were significant, and the endurance of the crystals varied depending on the type and orientation of the stress applied.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Testing"}
