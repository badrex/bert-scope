They found that the thermal conductivity of solid sulphur changes with its crystal structure, while liquid sulphur exhibits different thermal conductivity depending on its composition and temperature. The study provides insights into the physical and chemical properties of sulphur and its various phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
