They discovered that pyrogallic acid causes the corpuscles to change shape and eject a portion of their contents, while gallic acid dissolves the corpuscles' contents and leaves behind a bright yellow nucleus. These findings contribute to the understanding of blood chemistry and cellular biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
