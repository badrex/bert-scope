The research explores cytological, qualitative, and quantitative changes during growth and aging, including the roles of glial cells in phagocytosis and degeneration within the ganglia. The findings provide insights into the physiological functions of glial cells and their interactions with neurons in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
