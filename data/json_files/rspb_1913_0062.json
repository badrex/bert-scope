They argue that changes in feeding habits due to the scarcity of Anomodonts led to the development of Cynodonts, which eventually evolved into mammals with features such as flexible skin, hair, a four-chambered heart, and a more advanced jaw for mastication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
