The author reviews traditional methods and newer, short-term tests that rely on the unifying hypothesis that all carcinogenic chemicals are electrophiles or must be converted to such by metabolism. The article highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of carcinogenesis and the need for better risk assessment methods to prevent cancer.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Health and Toxicology"}
