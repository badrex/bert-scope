He explains the stability of the system, meaning the pole of the axis of rotation has nearly the same geographical latitude, and the angular velocity of rotation and obliquity of the ecliptic vary within small limits. Lubbock also provides new methods for obtaining inequalities of longitude and the radius vector in planetary theory, considering the square of the eccentricities. He demonstrates these methods with a numerical example involving Jupiter and Saturn.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
