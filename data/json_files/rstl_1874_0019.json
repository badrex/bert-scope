They propose a new genus, Bachiopteris, to include various previously described genera based on limited characteristics, such as vascular bundle forms. The author emphasizes the need for further research to accurately identify and categorize these fern fossils, as their external aspects are often unknown.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
