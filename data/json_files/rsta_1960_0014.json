They propose a model that explains the steady westward drift maintained by electromagnetic forces on the mantle. The non-uniform rotation of the Earth's core and the high conductivity of the fluid core cause the non-dipole field lines to move westward, indicating that the outer layers of the core do not rotate as rapidly as the mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
