They examined the reactions and properties of methyl-hexyl and hydride of heptyl, comparing them to ethyl-amyl. The author found that these hydrocarbons exhibit examples of absolute isomerism, meaning they have the same percentage composition and constitutional formula but differ in physical properties. This research contributes to the understanding of isomerism in hydrocarbons and their derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
