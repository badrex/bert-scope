The authors find that the wave travels with a uniform speed and that the ordinary differential equations governing the front have a solution for all wave speeds greater than or equal to a minimal speed. The wave velocity is given by V = (k1 * k2 * D * A0 * B0)^(1/2), where k1 and k2 are rate constants, D is the diffusion coefficient, A0 and B0 are the initial concentrations of reactants A and B, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Reaction-diffusion equations"}
