Kidd, observed the production of naphthaline, a white concrete substance resembling an essential oil, during the decomposition of coal tar when exposed to red heat. Naphthaline has an aromatic odor and taste, is fusible at 180 degrees, and has a remarkable tendency to crystallize into rhombic plates. Other substances obtained during the process include ammoniacal water, an oil with a bituminous and aromatic odor, and a yellow farina.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
