J. Macquorn Rankine, demonstrates a geometrical proposition related to curves that fulfill a specific condition. He proves that if a plane curve that meets this condition cuts itself at a double point, it does so at right angles. This proposition is a consequence of a previously stated mechanical proposition about waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
