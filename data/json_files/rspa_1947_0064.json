They propose a method to describe these deviations and analyze the changes in lattice constants. The study focuses on solid solutions of Au-Cu and shows that the distortion effect can be detected experimentally, while the thermal effect is secondary and cannot mask the distortion effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid state physics"}
