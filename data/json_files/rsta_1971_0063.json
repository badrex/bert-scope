The authors analyze data from a rocket flight in 1969, which allowed them to study the solar disk and limb. They derived models of the transition region and found that the temperature gradients are very steep. The results provide insights into the structure and behavior of the solar atmosphere, which can help improve our understanding of the sun and its effects on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
