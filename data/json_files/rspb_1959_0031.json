They found that asparagine deaminase activity increases towards the end of the growth cycle, while glucose and succinic dehydrogenase activities remain constant. During adaptation to a succinate medium, succinic dehydrogenase activity increases significantly, and cells lose their high activity when returned to a glucose medium. These findings provide insights into the physiological state of cells and the processes of adaptation to different growth media.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
