Ritchie's paper on the thermal decomposition of ozone, pointing out inconsistencies in the proposed reaction mechanism and activation energies. They argue that Ritchie's results do not accurately represent the homogeneous decomposition of ozone and suggest that the mechanism needs reevaluation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
