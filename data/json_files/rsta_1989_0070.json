The authors develop an intermediate coupled model to understand the oscillation mechanism in coupled general circulation models without atmospheric noise. They find that the coupled system undergoes a Hopf bifurcation, resulting in three to four-year oscillations, and a secondary bifurcation for six-month oscillations during the warm phase of the El Ni\u00f1o period. The study suggests that atmospheric noise is not essential for the oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
