They find that the replicative fitness of RNA variants depends on their molecular shape, independent of most of the underlying base sequence. The study reveals that a highly folded configuration may be a general design feature of polymers produced in simple replicating systems, and that strand secondary structure plays a crucial role in strand separation during replication. This research has implications for understanding the origin of replication and the RNA World theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
