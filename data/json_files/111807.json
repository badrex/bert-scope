They find that sugar is transformed into lactic acid through a process similar to fermentation, and that this transformation is influenced by the presence of other substances in the blood. The author also discusses the differences in sugar metabolism between healthy and diabetic individuals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Metabolism"}
