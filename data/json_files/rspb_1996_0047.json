The authors found that habitat fragmentation affects species distributions through its impact on regional population sizes, beyond what is expected from habitat loss alone. The results suggest that conservation efforts should consider not only patch size and isolation but also the effects of habitat fragmentation on bird populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
