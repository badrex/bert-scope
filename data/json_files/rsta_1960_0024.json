This equation predicts electrical potentials in the interface more accurately than the simple Gouy equation. The study focused on the effects of ionic size on adsorption and electrical potentials in the presence of long-chain ions and various electrolyte concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
