They describe the arrangement of rhabdomes and retinal cells, the number and density of these elements, and the nature of the nerve plexus in the retina. The study also investigates the degeneration of retinal cells after sectioning the optic nerve, providing insights into the functioning of the cephalopod retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
