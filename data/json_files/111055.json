The author also found that the disposition of rays after flexion affects their ability to be deflected or inflected, and that the fringes formed by light rays decrease or increase depending on the type of flexion and the distance from the bending body. These findings were demonstrated through mathematical investigations and experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
