They used a refined method to reduce the Doppler effect and Stark effect, allowing them to obtain sharp photographs of the doublet separations. The results showed that the doublet separation is constant and in exact agreement with Sommerfeld's theory. This confirms the fine structure of the hydrogen lines and the validity of Sommerfeld's extension of Bohr's theory."}
