The author discovers that most of the variation in shell patterns is due to pseudo-polymorphism, a phenomenon resulting from the interaction between polygenic inheritance and environmental conditions. The study also reveals that axial and spiral patterns are genetically different from each other, and that three yellow phenotypes occur in eastern populations but not in western populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Malacology"}
