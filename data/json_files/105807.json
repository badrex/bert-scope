He discovered that when electricity explodes, it can move objects away from the explosion site in all directions. This force is due to the expulsion of air from the explosion area, causing a concussion to nearby objects. Priestley also observed that this lateral force is similar to the power that causes concussions in water and on the surfaces of plants and animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
