The researchers found that the first clear-cut change in the oocyte occurs at about 5 p.m. under natural light conditions, and within the first hour of the onset of darkness under artificial illumination. Ovulation occurs 9 to 10 hours later. The study provides insights into the timing of ovulation and the effects of light and darkness on oocyte development in rats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
