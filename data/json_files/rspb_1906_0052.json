The study found that the amount of phaseolunatin in flax plants increases with germination and reaches a maximum at an early stage of growth before decreasing. This research helps to understand the process of cyanogenesis in flax plants and the role of phaseolunatin in their growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biochemistry"}
