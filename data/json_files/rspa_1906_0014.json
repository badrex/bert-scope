The authors found that these gases do not combine with other elements under severe chemical treatment. They also observed that helium does not have a tendency to combine with other elements, while argon shows a slight tendency to combine with some elements. The authors determined the vapor densities of various substances in both gases at high temperatures, providing insights into their chemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
