The authors show how these two problems are closely related through the forms of their governing equations and propose a generalized Richardson number for neutrally stable inviscid vortex motions. The study finds that an increase in crossflow renders stability in a progressively broader range of spanwise wavenumbers, and the effect of crossflow on the stability properties of different modes is non-uniform in the wavenumber space.", "scientific_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics > Boundary Layer Theory"}
