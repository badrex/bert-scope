They found that over 95% of applied ethylene was metabolized in less than 2 hours, with 85-95% of the radioactivity appearing in ethylene oxide. This study shows that the rapid metabolism of ethylene in plants is a tissue property and not due to microorganisms or wounding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
