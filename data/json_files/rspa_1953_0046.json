They found that the band structure and wave functions of the crystal were affected by the formation of the crystal, and that the band deriving from the 6s level of Pb overlaps with a band of the same symmetry as the 5p band. The calculated energy gap change with temperature is about half the experimental value.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid state physics"}
