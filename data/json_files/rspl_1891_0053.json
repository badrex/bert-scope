They found that the change of both \"internal\" and \"external\" conductivities with temperature must be taken into account in the equation for the distribution of temperature. The results showed that no relation similar to Kundt's for metals holds for the crystals experimented on.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
