He discovered that misselto seeds can be successfully grown by inoculating them into tree bark. The seeds have a slimy substance that helps them stick to the bark, and they grow by first sending out a root and then a head with leaves. This method of growth is different from other plants and has puzzled scientists for centuries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
