They used a magnetic torsion balance to measure these susceptibilities and discussed the importance of efficient packing in solids for accurate measurements. The results were compared with theoretical values, and the authors found good agreement between the calculated and experimental values. They also analyzed the crystal structure and chemical bonding of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical bonding and Crystal structure"}
