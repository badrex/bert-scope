H. C. Crick explains the genetic code, which connects the four-letter language of nucleic acids to the twenty-letter language of proteins. Crick discusses the biochemistry of protein synthesis, early work on the genetic code, collinearity between genes and proteins, and the direction of reading in the genetic code. The genetic code is now known with reasonable certainty, and it is believed to be universal across different organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
