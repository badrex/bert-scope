They found that these plants contain a glucoside with cyanogen and the corresponding enzyme. The authors observed that while the common form of L. corniculatus is more or less strongly cyanophoric, a form exists where the power of producing the cyanophoric glucoside is almost suppressed. The enzymic activity of these plants is important in understanding the correlation between the cyanophoric glucoside and the enzyme.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
