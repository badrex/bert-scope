Newland's Method for Distilling Fresh Water from Salt Water at Sea", "semantic_tags": ["Distillation", "Desalination", "Water Treatment", "Maritime Technology", "Boiling"], "tldr": "Capt. Newland presents a simple method to distill fresh water from salt water at sea using a copper or iron pot, an empty cask, sheet lead, a small jar, wood-ashes or soap, and billet-wood for fuel. The process involves boiling salt water mixed with wood-ashes to soften the salt, and then condensing the steam into fresh water in a receiver. The method produces 8-10 gallons of fresh water per day and requires replenishing every five to six hours.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Water Treatment"}
