The author explains how early neuronal differentiation and axonogenesis follow a segmented pattern in the hindbrain, with each segment, or rhombomere, acting as a lineage-restriction unit constructing a defined part of the hindbrain. The study also highlights the importance of rhombomeres in generating level-specific anatomical structures and the role of regulatory genes in their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
