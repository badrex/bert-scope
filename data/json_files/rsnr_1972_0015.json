It explores the roles of Franklin, Sir Joshua Reynolds, and Benjamin West in the development of bifocals and presents evidence that suggests other individuals may have been involved in the invention. The article also discusses the impact of bifocals on the lives of these historical figures and their contemporaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
