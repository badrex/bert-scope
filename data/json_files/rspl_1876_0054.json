The author investigates the consequences of the Earth's shape changing and how it impacts the obliquity of the ecliptic and the position of the Earth's axis. The study also discusses the possibility of readjustments to an approximate form of equilibrium and the role of internal density in these changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
