They use a different mathematical technique and notation to calculate the cross-section for both bound and virtual states, providing a more accurate estimation of the reaction's absolute magnitude. This research has practical applications in understanding nuclear reactions and energy production.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
