They found that mitochondria come into close association with the nuclear membrane and sometimes appear to fuse with it. The nuclear membrane is converted into endoplasmic reticulum during division and stored in the cytoplasm. The new nuclear membranes in the daughter cells are formed by the fusion of elements of the endoplasmic reticulum. This research provides insights into the complex processes of cell division and the role of mitochondria and endoplasmic reticulum in nuclear membrane dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
