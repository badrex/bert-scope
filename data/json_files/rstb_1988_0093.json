The authors provide new interpretations of lichide glabellar morphology, discuss the relationships within the Lichida, and recognize 43 genera and subgenera within the five subfamilies of the Lichidae. The Lichida may be related to the Odontopleurida and have more distant affinities with the Scutelluina.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
