They found significant differences in the number of cationogenic amino groups on the surface of T lymphocytes with H-2f and H-2S haplotypes. This difference in surface chemistry could be responsible for the subtle differences in the immune response between these mice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
