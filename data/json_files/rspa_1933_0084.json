It explores how the phase boundary potential is affected by the adsorbed film of iodine on cuprous iodide and the layer of cuprous iodide on the metal substrate. The study also investigates the conversion of the unstable iodide form to a stable one and its effect on the contact potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
