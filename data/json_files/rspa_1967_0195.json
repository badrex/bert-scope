They describe the new neutrino beam, the bubble chamber program, and the spark chamber installation, which will test muon number conservation. The authors also present the expected improvements in the event rate due to various factors, such as the new magnetic horn, second and third-stage focusing elements, and the increased repetition rate of the proton synchrotron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
