They discover that the green and red bands in the phosphorescent spectrum are composed of multiple components, and that phosphorescence occurs only below a certain temperature. The intense luminescence and phosphorescence observed in this study could have implications for understanding the behavior of solid materials under high-energy particle bombardment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
