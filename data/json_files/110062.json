Herschel discusses the phenomena of electric currents in fluid conductors, particularly focusing on the motion of particles in mercury with sulfuric acid. He also explores the effects of different metals and their amalgamation with mercury, as well as the influence of various conducting liquids. The author concludes by suggesting that these phenomena may be explained by the properties of electricity and the interactions between electricities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
