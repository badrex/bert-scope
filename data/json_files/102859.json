Halley observed unusual parhelia (mock-suns) and circular arches in the sky over London. The phenomenon consisted of a white circle around the sun, a halo, and two bright parhelia. The author measured the angles and described the colors and positions of the circles and parhelia. This observation provided valuable information about atmospheric conditions and the nature of these rare phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
