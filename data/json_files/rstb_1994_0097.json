It found that saliva from Brazilian flies had the most potent vasodilatory activity, while Colombian saliva had less, and Costa Rican saliva had very little maxadilan and lacked activity. The saliva of these flies also influenced the course of Leishmania infections, with Costa Rican flies having the strongest effect on cutaneous proliferation, while Brazilian and Colombian flies had a lesser impact on cutaneous infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
