They describe anomalous transmission effects due to inelastic scattering processes and introduce a complex lattice potential to account for absorption. The theory allows for the estimation of absorption parameters, but further investigation is needed to understand the mechanisms of inelastic electron scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
