They found that haemoglobin from various mammalian sources have similar structures and molecular weights. The study also revealed the impact of water and salt content on the crystal structure and the overall dimensions of the haemoglobin molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
