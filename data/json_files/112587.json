They propose that the Earth's crust, being a fluid mass, can change its external form and position when revolving on a new axis, leading to alterations in the climate. The author also considers the existence of a fluid nucleus within the Earth's crust and its potential effects on the axis of rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
