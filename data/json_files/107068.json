They found that the solubility of gases in water is influenced by both temperature and pressure, with higher pressures and lower temperatures generally leading to increased gas absorption. The author also discovered that the quality of the unabsorbed gas residue plays a significant role in the absorption process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Equilibria"}
