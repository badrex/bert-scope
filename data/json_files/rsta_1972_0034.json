It examines the factors contributing to these changes, including eustatic sea-level changes and local subsidence or upwarping of the Earth's crust. The study also considers the challenges in determining the exact course of these changes and the absence of a stable reference point for assessing sea-level changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Geophysics"}
