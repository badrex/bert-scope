He explains that snow melts during summer and hardens into ice, eventually turning into stone. These mountains are composed of crystals, some dark and others transparent and clear as Venetian glass. Hunters often fall through the cracks in these mountains, which are covered in snow. Crystals are dug out at the foot of these mountains and sold at a good rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
