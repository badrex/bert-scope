The authors found that the bulk of the supply to the bark is by way of the wood, and the rate of exchange between water-free space and Donnan-free space in the wood is rapid compared to that between water-free space and living cells. The results provide insights into the transport of ions and solutes in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
