The authors explain how acidification occurs due to the input of acidity from air pollution and biomass utilization, leading to soil acidification and the accumulation of toxic substances. They also explore the mechanisms of acid tolerance in plant species and the importance of understanding soil chemistry in managing forest ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Chemistry"}
