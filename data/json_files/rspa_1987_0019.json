The author shows how the crack boundary condition and the Griffith fracture criterion are valid for matrix cracking in composites. The article also describes an improved numerical method for solving a crack problem related to matrix cracking in brittle-matrix composites, providing accurate results on the relationship between cracking stress and the size of pre-existing defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
