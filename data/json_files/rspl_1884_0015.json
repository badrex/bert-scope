The author presents new evidence from histological, anatomical, and physiological studies, challenging the widely accepted view that the sub-ambulacral nerves are the primary motor nerves in Crinoidea. Instead, the author argues that the axial cords play a crucial role in the motor function of the arms, while the sub-ambulacral nerves may have a sensory function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinodermata"}
