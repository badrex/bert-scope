They found that the tenacity of adaptation increases with the length of exposure to D-arabinose, and that the bacteria develop this capacity rapidly during a few cell divisions. The loss of this capacity occurs gradually when grown in media that reverse the adaptation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
