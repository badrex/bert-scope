The study found that diving to depths of 180-540 meters could be effective and safe, with no decompression sickness encountered until low pressures. The research explored various aspects of neurophysiology, psychology, respiratory physiology, cardiovascular physiology, energy exchange, dietary requirements, haematology, and decompression sickness, revealing that the human body can adapt to high-pressure environments with proper precautions and techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
