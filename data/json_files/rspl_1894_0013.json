They found that edema occurs after different types of anaemia and conclude that starvation of the tissues plays an important part in its occurrence. The presence of products of tissue metabolism at the site of their formation is also found to be more important than tissue starvation. The author suggests that blood vessels play a somewhat uncertain role, but their function is considered subordinate to the role of tissues outside the blood vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pathology"}
