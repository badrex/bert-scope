They find that the motion of ionization is electrodynamically stable but hydrodynamically unstable, leading to the accumulation of ionization on one side of a cylinder and depletion on the other. This phenomenon is suggested to be the origin of sporadic E ionization and may play a significant role in the production of long-lasting meteor trails detected by radio methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
