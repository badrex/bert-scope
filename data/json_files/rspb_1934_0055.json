They also discovered that the difference in reactivity does not depend on the age of oxyhemoglobin from which it is formed, provided it is older than 0.1 second. This research helps to understand the kinetics of hemoglobin and its role in blood gas reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
