The method uses Green's theorem and a fundamental solution to obtain an integral equation for the potential on the cylinder. The numerical results are in good agreement with the method of multipoles, which is more efficient for circular shapes but not applicable to other sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
