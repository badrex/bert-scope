The authors found that the action potential in Chara cells is slower than in nerve cells by about 1000-fold. Voltage-clamp studies show that the current can be described by the Hodgkin-Huxley equations for the squid axon, with a time delay between the stimulus and the onset of excitation. Temperature and potential dependence of the delays and activation/inactivation time constants are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
