The author analyzes the spin coefficients and components of the Weyl tensor using the Newman-Penrose formalism and derives equations for the perturbations. The study aims to provide a foundation for understanding the behavior of black holes under perturbations and the effects of gravitational waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
