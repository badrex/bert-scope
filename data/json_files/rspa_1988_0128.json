They present a theoretical framework for calculating these effects and apply it to the decay of a multielectron system, particularly low-energy decays. The study aims to understand the impact of atomic and chemical environments on the decay process and its implications for the half-life of isotopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
