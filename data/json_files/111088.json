The safety-lamp is designed to prevent explosions caused by fire-damp, a dangerous mixture of gases found in coal mines. The lamp's design consists of a wire sieve surrounding the flame, which allows the flame to burn in an explosive environment without causing an explosion. The simplicity of the contraption makes it easy to manufacture and modify, providing miners with a secure means of lighting their work environment while safely utilizing and neutralizing fire-damp.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mining Safety"}
