The consortium, consisting of cellulolytic fungi, an anaerobic N2-fixing bacterium, and a bacterium that produces extracellular polysaccharide, aims to eliminate the negative effects of straw on crop establishment and yield while utilizing it as a fertilizer, soil conditioner, and biocontrol agent. The process accelerates straw decomposition and provides a product rich in nitrogen with no phytotoxicity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Management"}
