They suggest that the triplet state of anthracene is responsible for this reaction. The rate of polymerization and the molecular weight of the resulting polymer were studied, showing that anthracene both sensitizes the polymerization of styrene and enters the propagation of the chains.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
