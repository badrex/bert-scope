The research investigates the relationship between these highly variable shells and their environmental factors, such as lithology, and how these factors may influence the nature of the variation. The authors collected and analyzed 1500 shells from various horizons, providing insights into the evolution and classification of these shells in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology > Stratigraphy"}
