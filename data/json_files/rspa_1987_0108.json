It discusses the use of symbolic coding to represent trajectories on these surfaces and the application of ergodic theory to study their dynamical and metrical behavior. The author suggests that these models can be used to investigate possible manifestations of quantum chaos.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
