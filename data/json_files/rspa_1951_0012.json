This discovery is important because it provides evidence that the polymer units participate in the rate-determining transition complex, supporting the accepted proton transfer mechanism. The research also confirms the dependence of cyclization rate on Hammett's acidity function.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
