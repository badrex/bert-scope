He found that the energy of the secondary radiation from gases and light solids is proportional to the mass of gas through which the primary beam of X-rays passed. This discovery led to the understanding that the phenomenon of secondary radiation from metals is more complex, involving the emission of negative corpuscles or electrons. Barkla's experiments provided evidence of the polarization of X-rays, which was a significant advancement in the field of X-ray research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
