The tree has a hollow trunk and a petrified crust around the woody part within the bark. The author explores the possible reasons for this phenomenon, such as the flow of sap being petrified by the air, and suggests further inquiries into the nature of mines and ores.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
