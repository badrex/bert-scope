They discovered that type I diamonds have two kinds of absorption centers not found in type II diamonds. The study also reports differences in the infrared absorption spectra between the two types of diamonds and describes the absorption produced by irradiating diamonds with electrons, neutrons, and X-rays. The findings provide valuable information about the materials and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
