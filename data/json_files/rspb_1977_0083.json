They found that the abrogation of immunization is due to the induction of specific immunological tolerance of tumor antigens, which can be largely reversed by adoptive immunization. This suggests that the immune response to tumor cells is suppressed by prolonged trapping and destruction of lymphocytes that have responded to tumor antigens in the regional nodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Immunology > Tumor Immunology"}
