The average quantity of gas evolved per minute was found to be 267 cubic inches, with a total daily volume of 223 cubic feet. The author suggests that the gases may be coming from a large volume trapped in a cavern below the surface of the earth, heated by volcanic action in the past. The composition of the gases, with a high volume of nitrogen and no carburetted, sulphuretted, or phosphuretted hydrogen, supports the idea that they are not derived from atmospheric air.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
