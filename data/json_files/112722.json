He discovers that the cardboard tends to approach the fork, and this phenomenon occurs even when the fork is suspended. Guthrie examines various factors, such as the nature of the surface receiving the vibrations, and concludes that the effect of apparent attraction is due to atmospheric pressure, which is caused by undulatory dispersion. He suggests that the dispersion of vibrations that constitute radiant heat may cause bodies to approach.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
