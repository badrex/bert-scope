The authors analyze the oxygen isotope data from marine sediments and pollen analysis from terrestrial deposits to understand the climatic changes during this time. They conclude that the rapid temperature drop at the beginning of the last interglacial period was not caused by the presence of large ice sheets and that the minor glaciation that followed was also terminated by a climatic change, despite the limited extension of continental ice sheets. This research has significant implications for understanding Pleistocene glaciations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
