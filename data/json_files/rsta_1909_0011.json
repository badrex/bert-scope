They developed a method using electric fields and ionization chambers to measure the velocities of ions under different conditions. This research provided valuable information about the structure of ions and the charges they carry, contributing to the understanding of X-ray interactions with matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
