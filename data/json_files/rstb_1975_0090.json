The flora has a depauperate sample with fewer families and genera, most of which have a wide geographical range. The New Hebrides flora shows some regional differentiation, with northern and southern islands having different frequencies of species and the presence/absence of certain groups. The flora has closer affinities with Fiji, Samoa, and Tonga to the east, despite being geographically closer to the Solomon Islands and New Caledonia. The article examines the flora from a systematic perspective, focusing on taxonomic units and their distribution in various habitats and altitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Science"}
