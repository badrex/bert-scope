They observed various patterns, such as winding networks, straight axes, and fan-shaped tufts, depending on the nature of the material, the density of the fluid, and the drying conditions. These findings can help understand geological structures and provide insights into the drying process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
