They explore the potential increase in performance, the limits of silicon technology, and the inherent parallelism in physical systems. The authors also assess the cost-effectiveness of different machines and the resources available at Edinburgh for parallel computing.", "scientific_discipline": "Computer Science > Parallel Computing"}
