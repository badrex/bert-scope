The author argues that microbial communities can function through synergistic mechanisms to break down these compounds more effectively than single species of microorganisms. The article also highlights the limitations of traditional pure-culture techniques and emphasizes the need to consider the heterogeneity of natural environments in biodegradation studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Microbial Ecology"}
