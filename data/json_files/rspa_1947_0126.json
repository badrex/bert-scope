By assuming that the work done during a small plastic strain is a maximum as the yield-stress criterion is varied, a connection between the yield-stress and the strain-ratio relationship is established. This relationship is then used to calculate the criterion of yield, which is found to be very close to, but not identical with, the Mises-Hencky criterion.", "scientific_discipline": "Solid mechanics > Plasticity"}
