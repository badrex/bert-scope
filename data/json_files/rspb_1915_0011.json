They found that external pressure can increase the force of the pulse beat and produce audible sounds, which can be used to determine systolic and diastolic pressure. This method helps to understand the relationship between arterial pressure and pulse sounds, providing valuable insights into human physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
