It explores the possible reasons for the evolution of abiotic pollination, such as changes in floral structure and the development of appropriate aerodynamic surfaces for pollen capture. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the evolutionary pathways and forces that favor the transition from entomophily to anemophily.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Plant Evolution"}
