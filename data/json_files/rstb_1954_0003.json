The researchers discovered at least 23 species, including 11 new ones, belonging to seven genera. They also compared the Australian ammonite fauna with those from other circum-Pacific countries and central Asia, highlighting the significance of these findings for evolutionary and systematic theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Stratigraphy and Paleontology"}
