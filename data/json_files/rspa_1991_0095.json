They develop a pore size-dependent Langmuirian isotherm model and find that surface diffusion coefficients are strongly influenced by heterogeneity, with a stronger increase with overall coverage than predicted by the Darken equation. The results match experimental data without the use of a fitting parameter.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
