They demonstrate that the boundary conditions on the edge of the screen are crucial for the solution and that the integral-equation method is valid even when certain conditions are not met. The author also solves the three-dimensional problem of diffraction by a half-plane, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
