The author found clusters of tiny eggs that eventually hatched into snails, providing evidence against the univocal generation theory. This discovery refutes the arguments of Father Philippo Bonani, a Jesuit, who doubted the egg-based reproduction of snails and tried to disprove the experiments of Signor Redi.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Reproduction"}
