W. Hofmann, investigates the reactions of triethylphosphine with halides, focusing on tri-iodide compounds. He discovers new compounds and reaction mechanisms, including the transformation of triphosphonium salts into monophosphonium compounds when treated with silver oxide. The study also explores the potential of tetratomic bodies in further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
