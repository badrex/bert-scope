The spectrum was produced by passing heavy condensed discharges through vacuum tubes containing hydrogen and graphite or carbon electrodes. The author suggests that the Wolf-Rayet lines in question may possibly be due to the same origin as the spectrum associated with carbon.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
