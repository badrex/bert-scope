Hauksbee", "semantic_tags": ["Vacuum physics", "Friction", "Heat production", "Light production", "Phenomenon of sparks"], "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics", "tldr": "In a series of experiments conducted in 1704, Fr. Hauksbee demonstrated the production of light and heat through the attrition of amber and wool in a vacuum. He observed that the presence of air was necessary for the production of sparks when steel and flint were rubbed together. Hauksbee also studied the production of a purple light when glass rubbed against wool in a vacuum. The experiments showed that the presence of air affected the intensity and color of the produced light."}
