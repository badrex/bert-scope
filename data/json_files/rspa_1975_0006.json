They used a modified Loomis-Wood method to assign measurements to unambiguous transitions and derived a self-consistent set of molecular constants. This study improves our understanding of atmospheric opacity and has implications for synthetic spectrum applications in atmospheric physics and aeronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
