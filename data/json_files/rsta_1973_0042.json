The authors examine observational anomalies, assess the reliability of instruments, and explore the coherency of measurements. They emphasize the importance of further experimental investigations and theoretical models to improve understanding of the Earth's crust and mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
