They used the boron absorption method to estimate neutron energies and found that the absorption coefficient of slow neutrons in boron is inversely proportional to neutron velocity. The results provide insights into the mechanism of gamma-ray production by neutrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
