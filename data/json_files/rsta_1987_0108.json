The study examines density and temperature structure at stratospheric and mesospheric heights, changes in the stratospheric aerosol layer after the El Chichon eruption, characteristics of particles in polar stratospheric clouds, and height distributions of specific atmospheric constituents. The article also discusses the potential for future lidar developments, including near- and middle-infrared wavelengths and space-borne systems."}
