They also discovered that the temperature coefficient of the apparent energy of activation is as great as for other simple uncatalyzed hydrolyses. This suggests that the reaction mechanism involves the participation of many bonds and extramolecular effects, such as the rotation of solute molecules in their solvent envelopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
