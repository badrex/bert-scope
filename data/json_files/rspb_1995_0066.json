It shows that N-type calcium channels are responsible for activating potassium channels underlying the afterhyperpolarization, while other calcium channels contribute to action potential repolarization. These findings suggest that different calcium channels are colocalized with distinct calcium-activated potassium channels with specific physiological roles in vagal neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
