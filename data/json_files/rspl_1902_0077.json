This transformation occurs under various conditions and is catalyzed by substances like hydrogen chloride, sodium nitrite, and sodium hydrogen carbonate. The study is of interest as it provides insights into the behavior of diazonium salts and their isomeric changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
