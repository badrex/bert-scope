The authors analyze the factors influencing structural integrity, such as the high boiling point of sodium, its high thermal conductivity, and the choice of materials for structural components. They also consider safety-related structural components, discussing the main sources and levels of stress and the potential failure processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
