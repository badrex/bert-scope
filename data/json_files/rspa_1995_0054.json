They prove the existence of a countable infinity of such solutions satisfying the relevant boundary conditions and discuss their properties. This work contributes to the understanding of particle-like solutions in nonlinear field theories and the interplay between gravitational attraction and Yang-Mills self-interaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
