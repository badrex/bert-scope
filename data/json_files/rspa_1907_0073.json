He finds evidence of sulphur lines in the spectrum of Rigel and other stars, confirming previous conclusions about the presence of sulphur in hotter stars. The author also discusses the behavior of sulphur lines in laboratory and stellar spectra, and the possible disappearance of certain lines under certain conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
