The limb scanning technique allows for high vertical resolution and provides valuable data for understanding various processes in the atmosphere, such as radiative, chemical, and dynamical processes. The authors present examples of the instrument's capabilities and discuss potential applications of the data for various research areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
