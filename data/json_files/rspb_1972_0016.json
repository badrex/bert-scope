They find that echinoderms contain complex mixtures of C27, C28, and C29 sterols, which can be used to classify them into different groups based on their sterol types. The authors also discuss the possible origin of these sterols, suggesting that they may be derived from the diet and that some species can modify them to fit their specific needs. This research contributes to our understanding of the biochemical and phylogenetic relationships within the phylum Echinodermata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
