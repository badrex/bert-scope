The study focused on understanding the factors affecting the stability and equilibrium of floating bodies, such as specific gravity, volume, and shape. Atwood's findings provided valuable insights into the behavior of floating bodies and the stability of ships.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
