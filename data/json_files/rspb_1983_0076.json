The author reviews two asexual models, the's ratchet' and a model by Eigen and Schuster, and explores the implications of these models on the accuracy of replication and genome size. The article also examines the challenges of modeling sexual populations and the role of genetic recombination in preventing the 'ratchet' effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
