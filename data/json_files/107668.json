By examining the central adjustment of the lenses and using a series of images formed by reflection, Wollaston developed a way to detect and correct any defective position. This method allowed for better performance in telescopes, enabling the observation of small and distant celestial objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telescope Design"}
