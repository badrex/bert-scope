They discovered that the mean directive force on a compass needle is diminished in iron-built ships, leading to errors in navigation. They also found that the heeling error, caused by the ship's angle, can be corrected using mathematical formulas and observations of vertical force.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Engineering"}
