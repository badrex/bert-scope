Experiments with argon, nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, and krypton showed that the expansion is related to the surface free energy lowering and the bulk modulus of the adsorbent. The results confirmed an equation derived by the author, which explains the expansion of porous solids on gas adsorption due to changes in surface tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
