The author presents a method to characterize these properties using a failure envelope, which is independent of test temperatures and stress-strain-time history. The study focuses on various factors that influence the tensile stress-at-break and the ultimate extension ratio of elastomers, providing insights into the behavior of polymeric networks under large deformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
