They determine the critical Rayleigh number at the onset of convection and the corresponding heat transfer. The study focuses on the form and amplitude of convection, preferred cell patterns, and the effect of the Prandtl number on the motion. The results show good agreement with available experimental data and provide insights into heat transport in geothermal regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geothermal Energy and Porous Media"}
