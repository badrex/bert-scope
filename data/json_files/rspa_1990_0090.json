They determined dominant structural symmetries of short-range order using bond angle correlations and spherical harmonic invariants. The study provides a visual picture of intermediate-range order in molten salts and sheds light on their local structural ordering and interatomic forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
