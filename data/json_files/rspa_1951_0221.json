The authors used a photographic method to record the particles and analyze their scattering angles. They determined the angular distribution of protons and deuterons from the disintegration of light elements and elastic scattering of particles. This research provides valuable information for understanding nuclear processes and testing theoretical treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
