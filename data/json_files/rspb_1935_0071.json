The researchers found that the bound water in egg albumin at 20\u00b0C is approximately 0.35 grams per gram of solid, and the water content in both thick and thin egg white is nearly the same at different freezing temperatures. The findings have implications for understanding the properties of proteins and their interactions with water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
