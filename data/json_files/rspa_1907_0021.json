The author demonstrates how these changes can be used to understand the composition and structure of meteoric iron and provide insights into the behavior of nickel-iron alloys. The thermomagnetic method is established as a valuable tool for studying these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
