They found that shallow-water parasites were more infective to shallow-water snails, suggesting gene flow by the parasite is primarily from shallow to deep habitats. This recycling and coevolution may explain the maintenance of high frequencies of sexual individuals around the shallow-water margins of the lake.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
