They introduce a model that considers the distribution of atoms on both normal and abnormal lattice sites, and explain how the change from a solid to a liquid state can be seen as a continuous transition. The theory accounts for the sharp temperature change, volume change, and latent heat of fusion during the melting process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
