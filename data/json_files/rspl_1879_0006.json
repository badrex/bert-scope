They found that the effects of a conductor on the discharge depend on its size, capacity, and proximity to the tube. The study of these phenomena led the authors to conclude that the discharges at the two terminals of a tube are independent and primarily determined by the conditions at their own terminal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
