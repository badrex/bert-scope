They found that the addition of white light causes a shift in hue towards yellow in the red, orange, and green parts of the spectrum, while the blue-green and violet hues remain relatively unchanged. This study provides insights into color perception and discrepancies observed in color descriptions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
