They analyzed the chemical shifts and spin-spin coupling constants between the nuclei, providing insights into the molecular structure and behavior of the compound. Their findings contribute to the understanding of nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and the study of aromatic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
