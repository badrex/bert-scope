The research uses quantitative data on habitat selection and feeding ecology, along with an independent contrast method to control for the effects of phylogeny. The findings reveal strong support for adaptive interpretations of among-species variation in habitat selection and foraging site selection, with ecological variation associated with predictable morphological variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology", "sub_discipline": "Avian Ecology"}
