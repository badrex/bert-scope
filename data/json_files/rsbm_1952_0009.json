Dakin's early experience as an analyst and his time at Leeds University with Professor J.B. Cohen significantly influenced his career. He worked on various research topics, including optical activity, aromatic compounds, and the influence of the aluminium-mercury couple on chemical reactions. Dakin later moved to the United States, where he worked with Dr. Christian A. Herter and continued his research at the Lister Institute. His dedication to his work and his contributions to the field of biochemistry are remembered fondly by his contemporaries."}
