They found that atropine uptake could be related to receptor-bound drug and analyzed the kinetics of atropine uptake and washout. The findings suggest that the uptake behaves passively as a slowly permeant cation and no uptake referable to acetylcholine receptors was detected.", "scientific_discipline": "Pharmacology > Receptor binding"}
