They show that if the solution satisfies certain weak a priori bounds, the conduction-diffusion solution to the final value problem for the Boussinesq equations is stable on compact subintervals of a finite time interval. Uniqueness of the solution to the final value problem is also established.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Partial Differential Equations"}
