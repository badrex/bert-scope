The study uses the Bullard & Gellman method to analyze the flow and determine if it can maintain a magnetic field through electromagnetic induction. The results show that the three-component flow pattern has strong indications of being a dynamo, while the two-component flow pattern tested by Bullard & Gellman does not. This research contributes to understanding the potential mechanisms for maintaining Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
