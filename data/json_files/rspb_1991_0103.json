It found that the stretch sensitivity of these channels changes dramatically during the cell cleavage cycle. The activity of these channels may be regulated through -dependent phosphorylation, providing a basis for explaining the stretch sensitivity modulation during the cell cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
