Among the finds are rolls of papyri with Greek text, some still containing their umbilici. The manuscripts discuss topics such as music, poetry, and Epicurean philosophy. A bust of Epicurus and other philosopher heads were also found, suggesting they were part of a library collection. The King of Naples is committed to preserving these valuable remains and plans to publish a catalog of the discoveries.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
