Halley proposes a general method for calculating the elevation and charge required to strike any object above or below the horizon using a mortar in gunnery. He explains the advantages of this method, such as increased accuracy, reduced powder consumption, and ease of use. The article also includes a demonstration of how to find the proper elevation for a given charge and a method for determining the greatest horizontal range of a gun.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ballistics"}
