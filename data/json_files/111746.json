The author describes the apparatus and methods used to study the process of fertilization and the role of spermatozoa in the process. The paper also discusses the development of the embryo and the origin of different parts of the embryo from specific segments of the yolk. The author's observations suggest that the direction of the primary cleft of the yolk is influenced by the application of the spermatozoon to the egg.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
