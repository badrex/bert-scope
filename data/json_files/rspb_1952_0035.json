It found that rabbit antitoxins enter the foetal blood at a rate at least fifty times greater than bovine or equine antitoxins, while all three antitoxins enter the amniotic fluid at almost identical rates. The results suggest that the entry of rabbit antibodies into the foetal circulation may depend on an active process of absorption and secretion by cells, while the entry of both homologous and heterologous antibodies into the amniotic fluid and of heterologous antibodies into the foetal blood may depend on a process of'seepage' between cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
