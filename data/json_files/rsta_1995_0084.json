The authors find that the nonlinear growth of the wave is controlled by the diffusion layer at the edge of the critical layer associated with the wave. The solution of the evolution equation suggests that the wave either restructures the mean state to make it stable or develops a singularity at a finite distance downstream of the point of neutral stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
