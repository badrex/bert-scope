B. Airy, conducted a study to investigate the relationship between wind direction and the age of the moon using data from the Royal Observatory in Greenwich. The study aimed to determine if there was a physical foundation for the belief that a northerly wind may be expected during new moon. After analyzing data from 1840 to 1847, the study found no significant relationship between wind direction and moon age.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
