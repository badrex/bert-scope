The article examines the various facies and features of the ignimbrite, including its composition, grainsize, and fluidization processes. The study provides insights into the violent nature of the eruption and the behavior of pyroclastic flows, as well as the role of turbulence and fluidization in the formation of the ignimbrite.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Volcanology"}
