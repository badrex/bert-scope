Trisporic acid is involved in the formation of zygophores, increasing the rate of accumulation of terpenoids, and increasing its own rate of synthesis. It plays a crucial role in fungal mating and sexual differentiation, ensuring that the recipient fungus is only diverted from asexual reproduction when there is a good chance of successful mating with a compatible partner.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fungal Biology"}
