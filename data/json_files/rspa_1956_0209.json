The authors, A. C. R. Dean and Sir Cyril Hinshelwood, analyze factors such as the number of colonies reaching a standard size, the distribution of colony diameters, and the relationship between total numbers of cells plated and the appearance of separate colonies. Their findings can be interpreted by assuming that the delays preceding the onset of growth for any given cell are distributed about a modal value in an approximately Gaussian manner.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
