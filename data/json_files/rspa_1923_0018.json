They study the stability and dispersion of gaseous systems, focusing on the properties of solid colloidal suspensions in both liquid and gaseous states. The authors describe three methods for creating smokes and present a novel technique for counting particles using an ultra-microscope.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
