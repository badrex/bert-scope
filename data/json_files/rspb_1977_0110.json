They discovered that the membrane potential increase has two components: one directly related to the electrogenic mode of pump action and the other due to potassium depletion in the lumen of the T-tubular system. The authors estimated the extent of this depletion and provided insights into the underlying mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
