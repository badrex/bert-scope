They discovered that the reaction rate increases with time, and the molecular weights of polymers prepared at different temperatures show a maximum. The authors propose that the propagating free radicals become occluded in polymer aggregates during polymerization, affecting the rate coefficients and explaining the observed phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
