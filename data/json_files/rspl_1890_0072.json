They explain the importance of considering the extension of the middle surface in the deformation process and the need to satisfy the boundary conditions at the free edges of the shell. The author also reviews and critiques previous theories by other scientists, such as Lord Rayleigh, Mr. Basset, and Professor Lamb, and suggests a method of approximation for solving the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
