They explore the low-pressure phases of solid fullerenes using constant-pressure molecular dynamics and discuss the importance of explicit interaction sites and electrostatic contributions in the intermolecular potential. The study provides insights into the structure and dynamics of these carbon allotropes, which have potential applications in materials science and nanotechnology.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
