They discuss the role of interstitial cells, the presence of nematocysts in the endoderm, and the process of digestion within the organism. The study provides insights into the cellular structure and function of this simple organism, which can inform our understanding of more complex life forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
