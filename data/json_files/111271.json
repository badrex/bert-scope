He demonstrates that the alteration of internal space in chemical reactions occurs in multiple proportions, which is also true for changes in state, such as condensation and solidification. This discovery contributes to the understanding of heat transfer and chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
