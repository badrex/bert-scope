They found that sea water has a unique property that allows it to absorb more carbonic acid than fresh water. The author discovered that sulfate salts, such as magnesium sulfate and calcium sulfate, play a significant role in this absorption process. This research has practical implications for understanding the behavior of carbonic acid in the ocean and its release when heated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Equilibria"}
