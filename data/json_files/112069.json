Ellis, explores the concept of temperament in musical instruments with fixed tones. He explains that temperament involves slightly altering the perfect ratios of pitch in chords to increase the number of relations between chords and facilitate musical performance and composition. The author also discusses various systems of temperament and their properties, ultimately determining the best possible form of temperament based on the least disagreeable system of interval errors.", "scientific_discipline": "Music Theory > Acoustics"}
