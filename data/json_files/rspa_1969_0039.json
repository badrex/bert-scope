It develops an integral equation for the transition matrix and uses an asymptotic expansion for the electronic Hamiltonian and energy to show that the adiabatic approximation yields a -matrix correct up to the order of. A similar treatment is applied to the Lippmann-Schwinger equation for the total wavefunction, leading to the conclusion that the adiabatic approximation for the latter is correct up to the order of. These results are subject to the condition that the electronic energy is not degenerate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Chemistry"}
