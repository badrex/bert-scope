They found that the cross-sections decreased monotonically with increasing energy at lower energies, but remained constant as the energy increased. This research helped to understand the behavior of neutrons and their interactions with different materials, which is essential for nuclear energy applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
