Adsorbed films on the metal surfaces can significantly affect friction, with the most effective lubricants being those that form a solid and chemically attached film. The results support the view that friction of metals is mainly due to adhesion at the points of real contact, and is governed by the extent to which surface films can reduce metallic contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Chemistry"}
