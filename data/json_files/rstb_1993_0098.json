They discovered that the lateral motions of the head can be described as a combination of side-slip movements and yawing movements around a pivoting position. This research supports the theory that fish make head movements to swim more economically and reduce stimuli to their lateral line system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
