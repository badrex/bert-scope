The dissection revealed that these nerves were present and functioning similarly to those in a normal foetus, suggesting that the absence of a brain or spinal cord did not affect the nervous system's development. The study provides insights into the understanding of the nervous system and its role in the development of embryos.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
