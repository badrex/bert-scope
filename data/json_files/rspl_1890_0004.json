They conclude that the sympathetic system is mesoblastic, formed in situ, and initially independent of the cerebro-spinal nervous system. It becomes connected with certain spinal nerves through the growth of white rami communicantes, leading to irregular gangliation. The main cord also gives rise to peripheral non-medullated nerves, plexuses, and ganglia, as well as the medullary portions of the suprarenal bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
