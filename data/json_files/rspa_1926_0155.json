They used molybdenum K rays as primary X-radiation and observed the energies of the secondary cathode rays using the relativity formula. The results provide insights into the behavior of cathode rays and the atomic structure of elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
