It found that DNA amount varies threefold among species, and chromosome size is closely correlated with nuclear DNA amount. The research also discovered a striking uniformity in the relative sizes of chromosomes within complements, despite the large-scale variation in DNA amount and chromosome volume. The study suggests that the uniformity may be maintained despite disproportionate distribution of DNA changes within chromosomes, indicating a possible adaptive importance of a particular distribution of chromosome material within complements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
