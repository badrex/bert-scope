They found that the resistivity of electrolytic nickel at 0\u00b0C is 6935 C.G.S. units, and the average temperature coefficient between 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C is 0.00618. The results indicate that electrolytic nickel has a significantly lower resistivity than the nickel used in previous experiments. The author suggests investigating the physical differences between the two types of nickel.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
