Carotenoids achieve this through three separate mechanisms: quenching the triplet state of chlorophyll, physically inactivating the highly reactive singlet state of oxygen, and serving as an oxidizable substrate to protect other molecules from photodestruction. These protective effects have been observed in various non-photosynthetic systems, highlighting the importance of carotenoids in the survival of aerobic life on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
