They found that the true electrochemical equivalent of silver is probably not quite one part in a thousand greater than the value given by Lord Rayleigh. The silver voltameter is trustworthy, as the differences in measurements are minimal, amounting to not more than two parts in ten thousand.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
