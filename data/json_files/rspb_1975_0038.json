They discovered that the difference between the two types of broods is likely to be due to a difference in the mortality pattern between the sexes. The study provides evidence that differential mortality plays a significant role in the production of all-female broods in H. bolina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
