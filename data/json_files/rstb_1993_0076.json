The enzyme is found in multienzyme signaling complexes and generates novel phospholipids, which play a role in signal transduction pathways. The interaction between the PI 3-kinase and growth factor receptors is crucial for understanding its role in diverse cellular processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology", "sub_discipline": "Cell Signaling and Signal Transduction"}
