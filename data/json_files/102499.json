He discovers that beetles have numerous tiny eyes on their tunica cornea, which he estimates to be around 3,100. He also studies the anatomy of flies and their ability to run on polished surfaces, observing the hairs and corneas of their eyes. The author concludes that insects have complex vision and anatomy, challenging the notion that they are blind or lacking sight.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
