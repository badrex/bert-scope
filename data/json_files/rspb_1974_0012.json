It explores the use of data banks and structure-activity relationships to anticipate environmental impacts and toxic effects. The author presents a case study on the sulphonamide group, demonstrating the diverse biological properties and difficulties in rationalizing these observations in terms of detailed chemical structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Environmental and Earth Sciences"}
