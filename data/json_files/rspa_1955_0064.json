The authors calculate the forces between opposite quadrants and consider the interactions arising from surface dipoles. They evaluate the contributions to the surface tension from Coulomb, van der Waals, and short-range repulsive forces, taking into account dipole interactions. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of surface tension in ionic solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
