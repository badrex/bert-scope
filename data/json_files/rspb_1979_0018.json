The study examines various algae-invertebrate associations, including Hydra viridis and Paramecium bursaria with Chlorella sp., and Anthozoa with symbiotic dinoflagellates, to understand the cellular interactions and stability of these associations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
