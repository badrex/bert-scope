They found that isolation and high temperature can suppress the production of sexual forms, while crowding and lower temperatures can increase their production. The results suggest that there is an internal factor, such as a substance or cycle, that influences the production of sexual forms in each species of Cladocera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
