The fire is used for heating, cooking, and even worship by Indian priests and devotees. The fire is so hot that it can turn stones to lime, but it does not produce smoke or smell. Mounsey also discusses the white naphtha wells nearby, which are used for medicinal purposes and as fuel. The fire and naphtha have significant impacts on the local culture and daily life.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
