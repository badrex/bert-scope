They argue that the main portion of the total light comes from the stars themselves, rather than their surrounding atmospheres. This conclusion is based on the assumption that the distance between the observer and the cluster is so great that the small solid angle subtended by a small portion of the slit employed in the investigation is sufficient to take in a considerable number of stars."}
