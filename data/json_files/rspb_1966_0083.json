The researchers found that ileal sacs of 18-day-old rats remained viable and functional for at least an hour when incubated at 37\u00b0C. Homologous and heterologous agglutinins and 131I-labelled y-globulins were transported from the mucosal to the serosal fluid. The results provide insights into the intestinal absorption of proteins and the development of an in vitro preparation of neonatal intestine for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
