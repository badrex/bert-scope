The authors hypothesize that PGI2 is an anti-atherosclerotic hormone and that atherosclerosis develops when endothelial PGI2 synthetase is inhibited by lipid peroxides. They found that PGI2 therapy can alleviate symptoms of arteriosclerosis obliterans, central retinal vein occlusion, and spontaneous angina. The study suggests that PGI2 may be a promising treatment for vascular diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Vascular Biology"}
