The authors adapted the sodium-line reversal method, commonly used for flame temperature measurement, for time-resolved studies of temperature behind shock waves produced by a bursting diaphragm. The sensitivity of the method allows for temperature determination with an accuracy of about \u00b130\u00b0C. The study focuses on air, nitrogen, and oxygen gases, providing general agreement between calculated and observed temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
