They suggest that a crack arises from short-range non-Hookean actions of the dislocations at the head of the pile-up and develop a model that takes some account of this. The possibility of relieving the stresses around the pile-up by slip in the perfect lattice instead of fracture is considered, and it is shown that a crack can be initiated by a smaller number of dislocations in each of several slip planes, which may be important in ductile materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
