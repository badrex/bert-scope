The spectrum resembles that of planetary nebulae and bright line stars, suggesting a close association between these celestial bodies. The research strengthens the view that bright line stars occupy an intermediate position between nebulae and stars of Groups II and III.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Nebulae and Stellar Classification"}
