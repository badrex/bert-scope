The author, John Fothergill, suggests that distending the lungs with air might be a useful method to save lives in similar situations, as well as in cases of accidents, suffocation, or drowning. The technique is simple, inexpensive, and can be performed by anyone present at the scene, making it a valuable tool in emergency situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pulmonology"}
