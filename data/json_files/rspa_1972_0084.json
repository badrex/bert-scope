It shows that biphenyl enhances the total light output and affects the preglow and individual glow peaks. The results suggest that thermoluminescence is an electron-limited process and provide insights into the different trapping mechanisms for each glow peak.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
