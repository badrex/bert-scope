By studying the bank morphology and depositional structures, the author deduces that these limestones grew from Upper Tournaisian to Lower Visean times in an offshore position on a shallow water shelf. The growth mechanism involved the baffling activity of organisms, which trapped fine sediment and contributed to the formation of carbonate mudbanks. The term \"reef\" is questioned for these structures, and they are better classified as carbonate mudbanks.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Sedimentology and Stratigraphy"}
