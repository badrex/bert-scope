They analyze the structure and features of the brain, focusing on the occipital poles, the lunate operculum, and the parallel sulcus. The study provides insights into the similarities and differences between Sinanthropus and other early human types, as well as the evolution of the human brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Evolution"}
