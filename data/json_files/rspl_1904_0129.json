They discovered that heat and light can impact the opsonic power of the serum, with heat being more destructive. The study confirms that the serum, not the leucocytes, is the variable factor in the phagocytic power of different bloods. This research contributes to understanding the immune system's response to bacterial infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
