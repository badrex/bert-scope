They found that for the outer cylinder at rest, there exist complex eigenvalues corresponding to oscillatory damped disturbances. This discovery does not contradict the principle of exchange of stabilities, as the first mode to become unstable as the speed of the inner cylinder increases is non-oscillatory when the stability boundary is crossed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
