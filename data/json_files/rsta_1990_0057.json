The authors find that oxygen penetrates deeper into deep-sea sediments, allowing for the study of the distribution of both oxygen and trace elements around the depth of oxygen depletion. The depth at which the transition from oxygen to manganese respiration occurs plays a significant role in the diagenetic development of the sediment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
