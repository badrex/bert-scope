They find that the reaction follows the Bronsted's hypothesis, where the rate of reaction is determined by the formation of a fugitive complex. The study provides insights into the kinetics of reactions involving ions and the role of activity coefficients in the reaction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
