He discovered that oil of vitriol and spirit of nitre, in their most dephlogisticated state, are saturated with phlogiston, and when part of the acidifying principle is expelled, the remainder becomes supersaturated. This research contributed to the understanding of acid chemistry and chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid chemistry"}
