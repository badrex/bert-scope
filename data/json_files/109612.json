He found that these substances are more indestructible than natural tannin sources and can be produced from various materials, such as vegetable charcoal, resin, and dragon's blood. The artificial tannin substances also have unique properties, like being resistant to mold and unaffected by muriatic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and synthesis"}
