They discuss the structure of zirconolite and its polytypes, which are generated by modifying the relative orientation of hexagonal tungsten bronze layers. The authors propose a new nomenclature for describing these polytypes and discuss their implications for incorporating cationic impurities in the parent structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
