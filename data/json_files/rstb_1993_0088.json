The xylem system allows for rapid propagation of these signals throughout the plant, affecting stomatal aperture and potentially triggering systemic changes in surface electrical potential. Wound-induced hydraulic signals can also activate defense responses in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
