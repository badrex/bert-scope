The authors found that water and glycerol both influence the rate and extent of fat synthesis and hydrolysis. They discovered that water retards the reaction by preventing the enzyme and fat from coming into contact, while an excess of glycerol reduces the extent of synthesis. The results provide insights into the complex interactions between enzymes, fats, and water in biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
