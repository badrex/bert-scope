They explain the three components of magnetic variations and how the local-time variations can affect the overall results. The author also discusses the influence of storm intensity on the course of a magnetic storm and the importance of considering multiple stations' data to understand the phenomenon accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
