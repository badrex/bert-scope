They propose a hypothesis that explains the transitions between ice forms and the effect of impurities on these transitions. This hypothesis could help explain why certain ice structures form at specific temperatures and how impurities, such as heavy water, can alter these structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
