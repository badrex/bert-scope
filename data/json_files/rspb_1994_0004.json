They analyze a two-state class model and discuss the implications of non-identifiability on the determination of kinetic parameters from density functions. The study highlights the importance of understanding model properties to avoid misinterpretation of data in patch clamp experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
