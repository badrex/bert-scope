He argues that the use of these figures in England is much older than previously thought, and traces their origins to Arabic learning and astronomical tables. The author also notes the differences in the shape of these figures compared to Arabic numerals, suggesting that they had been in use for some time.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
