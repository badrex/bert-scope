The research suggests that two frost cycles occurred during this period, with the first being very severe and the second shorter and sharper. The findings provide insights into the formation of periglacial landforms and the complex interactions between ice masses and periglacial conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
