They observed mass take-off, layering, and common orientation behaviors. The study provided insights into grasshopper migration and helped identify potential source areas of the insects. This information can be useful for developing effective control strategies against grasshopper pests in the Sahelian zone of West Africa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
