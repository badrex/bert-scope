It shows that hypophysectomy causes the testes to regress to the anoestrous condition within a month, characterized by a decrease in testis weight and aspermatogenesis. The epididymis also shows similar atrophy. The experimental regression is about three times faster than the normal decline into anoestrous.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
