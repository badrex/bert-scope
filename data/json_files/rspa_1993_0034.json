They found that the surface phonon contribution to the differential cross-section is comparable to that from bulk phonons. The study helps in understanding the role of surface effects in the formation of diffuse RHEED patterns and improves the accuracy of surface structure determination and in situ control of molecular-beam epitaxy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
