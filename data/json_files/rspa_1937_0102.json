The authors found that the ignition points of these mixtures decrease with increasing pressure. They also observed cool flames in some mixtures, particularly propylene-air mixtures, and discussed the implications of their findings for the problem of \"knock\" in combustion engines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame Chemistry"}
