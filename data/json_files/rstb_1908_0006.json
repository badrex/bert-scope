Experiments show that the periosteum alone is not responsible for bone regeneration, and other factors, such as the bone itself, play a significant role in the process. The study also demonstrates that bone can produce new bone tissue even when denuded of its periosteum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
