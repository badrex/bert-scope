The author suggests that the motion of air in middle latitudes is more of a passage around the pole in a general easterly direction than previously thought. The study supports the existence of a general circulation of the atmosphere from west to east along middle latitudes, with deviations due to local weather systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
