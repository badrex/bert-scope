Koji is made from steamed rice and a fungus, which breaks down the starch into soluble components. The study shows that koji has properties similar to malt-extract and can invert cane-sugar, hydrate maltose and dextrin, and liquefy starch-paste.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology and Biochemistry"}
