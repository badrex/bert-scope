They emphasize the importance of understanding the assumptions involved in the valence bond and molecular orbital theories to accurately interpret experimental data. The author also highlights the limitations of these theories and suggests improvements for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Bonding"}
