The authors developed a new controlled-point rotation viscometer to measure the viscosity of liquids at high temperatures. They found that the viscosity isotherms do not exhibit an inflection point, unlike previous work using graphite crucibles. The study also suggests a new structure for liquid silicates and glasses, which is consistent with various experimental observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
