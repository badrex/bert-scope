They used a refined experimental design to create a controlled environment free of living organisms and tested various solutions, including sodium phosphate and ammonia tartrate. The results showed no evidence of life emerging from these solutions, challenging the theory of spontaneous generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
