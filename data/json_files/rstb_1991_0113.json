The research explores the hunting income patterns and the role of big game hunting in the evolution of the human diet. The Hadza people primarily focus on hunting large animals, which provides a higher mean daily rate of meat but comes with a high risk of failure. Sharing large carcasses helps reduce the risk of meatless days and storage issues. The study suggests that the nutritional benefits may not be the primary reason for the persistence of big game hunting and sharing, and other factors, such as selective incentives, may be necessary to motivate individuals to provide these resources.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anthropology"}
