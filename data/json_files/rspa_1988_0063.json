They demonstrated that a single uniaxial continuum true-stress-true-strain curve can predict the behavior of laboratory specimens with different geometries, ensuring the uniqueness of the parameters. This approach allows for accurate characterization of material behavior over a wide range of deformations, from zero to final fracture.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
