The mission's first results reveal the evolution and disappearance of interplanetary magnetic sector structures, the onset of high-speed solar wind streams, signatures of complex coronal mass ejections, and the high-latitude structure of the heliospheric magnetic field. These findings provide insights into the evolution of large-scale coronal structures, solar magnetic fields, and processes controlling the solar activity cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Physics"}
