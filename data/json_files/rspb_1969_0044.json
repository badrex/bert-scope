They investigate the actions of cortical stimulation on corticospinal pyramidal neurons and the differences in surface-anodal and surface-cathodal thresholds. The study provides insights into motor control and the role of the motor cortex in primates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
