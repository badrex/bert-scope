This process involves the reduction of a hydrous ferric oxide precursor and is controlled by the bacteria. The iron oxide particles, or magnetosomes, are arranged in chains that function as a biomagnetic compass, allowing the bacteria to navigate along magnetic field lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
