Exact results are provided to the third order in density and compared with various approximate theories, such as the Born-Green, Percus-Yevick, and hyperchain. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of liquids and their interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
