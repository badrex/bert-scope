The stream appears when the tide reaches a certain level and ceases when the tide falls below that level. Storer suggests that the water may be connected to subterranean communication between the sea and the spring. The stream's behavior is influenced by the tide and rainfall, providing fresh water for various uses.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
