It presents equations for the various diffusional, thermal diffusional, and thermal fluxes needed to obtain reaction rates from experimental temperature and composition profiles in flames. The authors also describe the organization of computer programs for calculating multicomponent diffusion and thermal diffusion coefficients and thermal conductivity. They use these expressions to derive equations for mole fraction and temperature gradients in flowing reaction systems, such as flames, where transport processes and reactions occur side by side.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
