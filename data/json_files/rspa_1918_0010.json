The theory is useful for understanding wave behavior and has applications in naval architecture, ship hydrodynamics, and oceanography. The author also explores the effects of cross-current velocities and stationary waves on the trochoidal wave motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
