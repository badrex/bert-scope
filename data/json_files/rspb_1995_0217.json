The study uses nonlinear time-series analysis to examine the effects of density-dependent and density-independent processes on population fluctuations. The results suggest that chaotic dynamics are more prevalent in northern populations, while southern populations exhibit more stable dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
