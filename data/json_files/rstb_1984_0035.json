It discusses the different levels of mineralization, from biological induction to matrix-mediated mineralization, and how organic molecules control the growth and properties of biominerals. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the underlying principles of mineralization, such as nucleation, growth, and inhibition, and the inorganic chemistry of minerals found in biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biominerals"}
