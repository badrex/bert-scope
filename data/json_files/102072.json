He compares the costs and capabilities of different modes of land transportation, such as carts, wagons, and horses, and suggests various tests to determine the optimal design and performance of carriages and wheels. Petty's experiments aim to improve the understanding of land transportation and contribute to the development of more efficient and effective means of carrying goods and people.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
