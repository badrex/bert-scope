The results show that the toxic value of theobromine is approximately 1.7 times that of caffeine for equal molecules or 1.8 times for equal weights. The study also suggests that the toxic effect of tea and coffee is mainly due to caffeine, with tannic acid producing a secondary effect on muscle proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
