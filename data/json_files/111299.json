Claudet, investigates the phenomenon of stereoscopic illusions in refracting stereoscopes. He explains how the bending of vertical lines by the prismatic refraction of semi-lenses in the stereoscope creates the illusion of concavity or convexity. Claudet also proposes a new design for a stereoscope that uses two entire lenses instead of semi-lenses, providing a more accurate representation of flat surfaces with all the illusion of relief and distance.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
