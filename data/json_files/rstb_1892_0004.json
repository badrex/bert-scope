They found a series of organs in the middle line at the posterior end of each dorsal scale, which they believe perform the function of respiration. These organs consist of an air sac and a network of tubes that open into the air sac and project into the pericardial space, where they are bathed in blood. This discovery challenges existing accounts of respiration in the Scutigeridae and has implications for understanding the morphology of myriapods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Myriapoda"}
