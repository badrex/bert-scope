It shows that 39% of men with haemophilia A and 5% of men with haemophilia B were positive for HIV antibody. The rate of progression to AIDS was found to be strongly dependent on age, with a higher incidence among older patients. The study also found no new seroconversions after November 1986, suggesting that measures taken to improve blood product safety were effective in preventing further infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Epidemiology"}
