They discovered that the density of hydrogenium varies depending on the type of alloy and the expansion and retraction of the metal when hydrogen is added or removed. The author found that palladium alloys with metals like platinum and gold have a more uniform expansion and do not undergo the same retraction as pure palladium, resulting in a more accurate measurement of hydrogenium density.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy and Metal Properties"}
