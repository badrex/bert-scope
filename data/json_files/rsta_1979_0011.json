It explains how increasing concentrations of these substances can lead to rising surface temperatures and examines the limitations of current atmospheric models used to predict these changes. The author highlights the importance of cloud cover and its interaction with other factors in determining the overall impact of greenhouse gases on climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
