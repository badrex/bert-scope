Beddoes, a supporter of republican France, was a chemist and an original thinker who developed an interest in \"pneumatic medicine,\" a type of experimental medicine that depended on the new physiology of respiration and the knowledge of gases other than atmospheric air. James Watt, a renowned inventor and engineer, became a staunch supporter of Beddoes' views on pneumatic medicine and used his inventive genius and resources to help Beddoes in his work.
