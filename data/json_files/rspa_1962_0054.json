They explore the role of transition metals as solutes and solvents, and discuss the impact of their presence on electrical and thermal resistance. The study focuses on understanding the scattering models and the underlying mechanisms responsible for the anomalous resistance and thermo-electric power observed in these alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
