The authors use laboratory experiments and data from space missions to create a temperature profile of the Moon's interior, supporting the idea of a hot Moon. They also explore the effects of iron content and oxidation state on the electrical conductivity of lunar materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
