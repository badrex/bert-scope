The authors explore the effects of crystal structure and energy levels on the behavior of electrons in metals, particularly in transition metals. They also analyze the heat capacity of electrons in metals and compare it to the Sommerfeld formula.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
