He found that the shocks from the Torpedo did not decompose water or affect a magnetic needle, suggesting that animal electricity might be a distinctive and peculiar form of electricity. The connection between animal electricity and the nervous system could lead to important discoveries in physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
