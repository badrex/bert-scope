They measured the activity coefficients of the electrolytes in the resin phase and examined their significance in terms of the Katchalsky & Lifson theory of polyelectrolyte solutions. This research provides a critical experimental test of the view that cation-exchange resins follow the laws of concentrated electrolyte solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
