Astromyelon has a unique structure with branching, unarticulated stems and a stellate pith in transverse sections. The author compares and contrasts the features of Astromyelon and Calamites, including their vascular zones, medullary rays, and the absence of articulations and internodal canals in Astromyelon. This study contributes to the understanding of the diverse types of vegetation in the coal measures and their classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
