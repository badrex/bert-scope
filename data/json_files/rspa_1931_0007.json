They used two methods, the Wilson cloud method and analyzing energy loss through thin foils. The results showed that the observed energy loss rates were significantly higher than the theoretical values predicted by Bohr's and Gaunt's formulas, indicating that these formulas need refinement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
