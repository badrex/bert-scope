They discovered that alburnous vessels in trees can have an inverted action, allowing the plant to survive when communication with the leaves is cut off. In potatoes, the author found that the fluid necessary for tuberous root formation comes from the leaves and stems, and can form tubers in different locations when the normal path is obstructed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
