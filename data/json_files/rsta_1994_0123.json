The stable remanent magnetization of Apollo igneous rocks and high-grade breccias suggests that the Moon had a primeval magnetic field generated in a core. The existence of this core and the Moon's non-hydrostatic figure imply that the Moon had three satellites, whose orbits decayed and broke up at the Roche limit, creating impact basins near the equator. Lunar paleomagnetism may provide important constraints on theories of lunar and planetary formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Lunar Geology"}
