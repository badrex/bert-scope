Henry conducted experiments to clarify the properties of tin and iodine compounds. He discovered that the substance obtained by heating tin with twice its weight of iodine is a mixture of two salts: a soluble proto-iodide and an insoluble biniodide. Henry also found that the biniodide sublimes at 356\u00b0F, while the proto-iodide can be heated to redness without subliming.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
