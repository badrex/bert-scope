It focuses on rigid frames and their properties, such as curvature, rotation, and rate-of-strain. The authors also explore conditions for the extension of the Herglotz-Noether theorem and properties of isometric and irrotational rigid frames. The connection between rigid frames and certain types of motions is established.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
