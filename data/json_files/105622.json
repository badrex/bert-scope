He discusses the importance of such observations for determining the Sun's parallax and improving astronomical knowledge. The observations were made using a micrometer, and the results are analyzed to determine the right ascension and declination of Venus. This work contributed to the understanding of celestial mechanics and the development of astronomical instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
