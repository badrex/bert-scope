They analyze the frequency and magnitude of disturbances in different years and find a correlation with the variation in solar spots. The study also reveals a progressive increase in the amount of disturbance and the diurnal range of the declination from 1843 to 1848, suggesting a possible causal connection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
