The models differ in whether traits that settle contests are costly in contexts other than fighting and whether signals are used. The authors conclude that contests will be settled by non-costly traits only if the value of the contested resource is small relative to the cost of fighting, and honest signaling of aggressiveness is stable only if individuals giving signals that are inconsistent with their behavior suffer costs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
