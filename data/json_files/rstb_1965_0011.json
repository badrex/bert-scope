The deposit's stratigraphy and the pollen, plant, and animal remains found within it provide evidence for the Late-glacial and Post-glacial environmental history of the region. The research confirms the age attribution of the deposit and offers insights into the marine and freshwater conditions during the Late-glacial period.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
