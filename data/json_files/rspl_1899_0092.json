{"article_id": "rspl_1899_0092", "revised_title": "Moonlight and Inducing Temporary Color Blindness", "semantic_tags": ["Color Vision", "Moonlight", "Color Blindness", "Spectroscopy", "Visual Perception"], "tldr": "The author conducted experiments to study the effects of moonlight on color vision and temporary color blindness. They discovered that moonlight, being a weaker light source than sunlight, can still induce temporary color blindness. The author also found that the contrast of light and shadow in moonlight is similar to sunlight, and that temporary color blindness can be induced by looking at brightly lit objects during the day. This challenges the idea that temporary color blindness is a result of excessive stimulation of the color sensations.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
