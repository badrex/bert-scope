The authors found that bacteria with resistance to sulphathiazole have an enhanced ability to synthesize folic acid and accumulate intracellular pteridine. This resistance can be inherited and is associated with altered enzymatic activities and alternative metabolic pathways.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
