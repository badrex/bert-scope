They discovered that by using oxidable metals at the anode and nascent hydrogen and nitrogen at the cathode, they could form permanent compounds with nitrogen. The author also mentioned a similar deposit observed by Mr. Daniell, which they believed to be worthy of further investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
