The study found that the electron giving rise to the bands is an electron from the conjugated double-bond electrons. The ionization potentials of the molecules were deduced from Rydberg series, and the electronic nature of the first transition was interpreted. The spectra provide insights into the electronic structure and conjugation of these molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
