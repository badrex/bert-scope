T. Desaguliers demonstrate the effect of different salts and temperatures on ice. They found that certain salts, such as sea salt and potash, can increase the cold of ice, which has implications for testing gunpowder and making ice cream. The authors also suggest using spirit of wine and ammonium salt to increase the cold of ice in the absence of ice itself.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Cryogenics"}
