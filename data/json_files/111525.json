They discuss the results of these observations, including the mean state and secular changes of magnetic elements, diurnal and annual fluctuations, and the existence of a new department of science related to magnetic action. The findings reveal a complex relationship between the sun, the Earth's magnetism, and the whole planetary system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
