The author finds that values of air density derived from orbital decay are systematically higher and cannot be explained by the absolute accuracy claimed for the gauges. The study highlights the importance of understanding the differences between drag-derived values and instrument measurements for accurate density calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
