They transform the problem into a horizontal channel, allowing for easier calculations and obtaining the exact solution for the water wave in a sloping channel produced by the sudden release of a triangular wedge of water. The method can be applied to various problems related to surface run-off and flash floods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
