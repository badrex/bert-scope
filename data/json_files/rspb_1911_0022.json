They discovered that the actual magnitude of assimilation in a submerged plant is determined by the concentration of carbon dioxide, light, and temperature. The study found that submerged plants like Elodea and Fontinalis have different efficiencies in utilizing carbon dioxide, possibly due to structural differences and the presence of airspaces in flowering plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
