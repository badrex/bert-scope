He discovered the presence of small, round, transparent drops and observed that the palate had a complex structure with numerous small protuberances, holes, and fibers. He also found that the taste sensation was produced by long particles that received juices. This research provided valuable insights into the anatomy and physiology of the palate and taste sensation."}
