The research provides insight into the process of spermatogenesis and the development of sex-cords in birds, as well as the factors that contribute to sex reversal. The findings have implications for understanding sexual development in birds and may help identify potential treatments for sex-related disorders in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Development and Reproduction"}
