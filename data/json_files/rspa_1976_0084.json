They measured the magnetic moment density using polarized neutron diffraction and found that the orbital magnetic moment is quenched in the chromium ions. The results provide insights into the bonding between transition metal ions and neighboring atoms in insulators.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Orbital Theory"}
