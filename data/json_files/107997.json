He discovered new subsesquisalts, which are salts containing one and a half proportions of base to one of acid, and studied their properties and crystal structures. This research expanded the understanding of these interesting salts and their interactions with other chemicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
