The study shows that interband inelastic scattering transitions of fast electrons are forbidden when the interaction potential is of the long-range type, which might arise in the excitation of plasmons. This result explains recent electron microscope observations of similar diffraction contrast effects obtained using elastically scattered or inelastically scattered electrons. The theory also predicts a Poisson distribution for the intensities of the various peaks observed in the energy spectrum of the transmitted electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystal Physics"}
