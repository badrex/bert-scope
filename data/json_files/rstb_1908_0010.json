The plant has a slender stem and minute structure, with advanced seed habits not seen in other Cryptogams. The megasporophylls have a single thin-walled spore resembling an embryo-sac, surrounded by an integument and physiological stigma. The foliage leaves are delicate and thin, without stomates, and have characteristic multiseriate hairs. This discovery provides valuable insights into the evolution of early seed plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
