The authors propose a model for the hydration process, identifying different phases and their solubility. They also discuss the role of tricalcium aluminate hydration in the overall cement chemistry and its implications for cement technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
