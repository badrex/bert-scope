They simulate a two-dimensional sheet of atrial tissue and find that repetitive forcing can induce a drift of a spiral wave, potentially moving it to the inexcitable boundaries and eliminating re-entry. This approach could be a means of eliminating cardiac arrhythmias caused by re-entry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
