The phylogenetic approach involves a broader comparative context based on the outgroup algorithm, while extrapolatory approaches depend on established biological generalizations. The study compares phylogenetic and extrapolatory methods for reconstructing the shoulder musculature of the ornithomimid Struthiomimus, highlighting the importance of a precise research program to reduce speculation in fossil reconstruction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
