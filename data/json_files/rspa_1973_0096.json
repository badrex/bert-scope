The author assumes that the electric field stress is set up instantaneously and analyzes the development of the flow field as the drop is deformed. The study focuses on balancing the surface tension and electric field stress, as well as the hydrodynamic stresses produced by liquid flow in the drop and its surroundings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
