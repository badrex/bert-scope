The researchers found that the reversal potential for GABA-induced hyperpolarization was -77.0 \u00b1 2.4 mV, and the response was highly sensitive to changes in external chloride. Intracellular ion-sensitive microelectrodes confirmed that an influx of chloride ions mediated the GABA response. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of GABA receptor activation on invertebrate neurons and the role of chloride ions in their response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
