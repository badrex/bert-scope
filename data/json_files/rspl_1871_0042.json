The instrument consists of three thermometers, a wet bulb, a dry bulb, and an acid bulb, which are read together for comparison. The acid bulb thermometer measures the amount of moisture absorbed by the acid on its surface, providing a more accurate and practical method for hygrometric measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
