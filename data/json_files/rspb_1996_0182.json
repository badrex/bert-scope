In lakes and controlled experiments, recruitment of specific flagellated algal species was high when grazer abundances were low, while recruitment was negligible when grazer abundances were high. This behavior allows algae to avoid entry into the water column at high grazer abundances, reducing exposure to grazing and potentially affecting dominance and temporal succession in algal communities.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Aquatic Ecology"}
