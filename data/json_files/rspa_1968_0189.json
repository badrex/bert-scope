This technique uses energy loss information from transmitted electrons to analyze the distribution of magnesium atoms and reveal the presence of precipitates. The method provides a higher spatial resolution compared to other microanalysis systems, allowing for a more detailed investigation of the alloy's properties and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Microanalysis"}
