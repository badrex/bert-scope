They found that the coefficient of friction is influenced by the chemical composition of both the solid face and the lubricant. This study confirms earlier findings and reveals a new relationship between the materials, providing a better understanding of the factors that determine friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science and Tribology"}
