They describe various experimental methods used to study these rays, including pressure chambers, electron counters, and the detection of secondary radiation. The author also considers different theories about the nature of ultra-penetrating rays, such as whether they are waves, electrons, or material particles. Despite the progress made in studying these rays, the exact nature of ultra-penetrating radiation remains unclear.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
