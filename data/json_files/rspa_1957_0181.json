They measured the differential cross-section and average energy loss of neutrons at various angles and liquid temperatures. The results provided insights into the radial distribution function and the zero-angle cross-sections, which were close to those given by the theory of density fluctuations in a liquid. The energy transfers could not be explained without a liquid model, and the backward scattering could be explained as either a free atom process or one involving phonon excitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear and Particle Physics"}
