The results showed distinct diffraction patterns in rare gases, while diatomic gases and more complex molecules did not exhibit clear diffraction maxima. This suggests a new method for examining the structure of complex molecules by analyzing electron diffraction patterns in scattered electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
