He discovered a new liquid pure perchloric acid, ClO4OH, and the monohydrated or crystallized acid. Perchloric acid is a powerful oxidizer, reacting with metals, sulfur, phosphorus, and carbonized materials with explosive combustion. It is challenging to preserve and distill due to its decomposition at ordinary temperatures. The author plans to further investigate the composition and formation of a black explosive substance formed during the decomposition process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
