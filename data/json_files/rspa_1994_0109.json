The pressure field is determined by topological changes in the retarded shape, corresponding to the presence of stationary points of a certain phase function. The overall pressure waveform takes the form of a series of short bursts of high pressure fluctuation, each burst corresponding to the crossing of a stationary point by the retarded blade shape. Asymptotic formulae are derived using the asymptotic regime of small chord length, and the complete near-field structure is considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
