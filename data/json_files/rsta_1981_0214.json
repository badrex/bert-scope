The authors analyze the model's properties and discuss its potential applications in various fields, such as surface roughness, wind strength, and contact mechanics. The non-Gaussian model shows qualitatively different behavior compared to the Gaussian model, offering new insights into the study of random surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
