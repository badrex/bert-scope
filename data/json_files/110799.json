The author describes the construction of the tide gauge and the methods of observation used to ensure accuracy. The study found two distinct periods of high water during each 24-hour interval, with a range of about 4 hours and 27 minutes. The author also discusses the influence of full and change moon phases on high water times and the impact of land and sea breezes on tide levels. The paper encourages further research to understand seasonal variations in tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
