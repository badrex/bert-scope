It explores the attributes of pathogens that help them overcome host defense mechanisms, such as motility, glycosidase production, and chemotactic and attachment factors. The article also highlights three different patterns of infection observed at the cell surface and the role of adhesins in bacterial attachment to the mucosa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
