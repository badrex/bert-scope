They found that both ions bind together, suggesting that ATP is hydrolyzed in a one-step reaction activated synergistically by Na and K. This discovery challenges the previously accepted two-step reaction model and provides new insights into the mechanism of the sodium pump.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
