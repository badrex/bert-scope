The authors find that in situations where resonant motions can escape over a local maximum of potential energy, there is a sudden reduction in the safe basin of attraction. This reduction can be used as a basis for a new design criterion based on transient motions, which is both conceptually simpler and more relevant than current stability analyses of steady-state rolling motions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ocean Engineering"}
