The author demonstrates that when surfaces touch at multiple points, the frictional force becomes nearly proportional to the true area of contact, leading to a better understanding of the relationship between friction and load. The findings suggest that elastic deformation can be consistent with Amontons' law in certain conditions, such as with Perspex and some metal specimens.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
