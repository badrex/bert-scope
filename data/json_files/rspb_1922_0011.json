They find that the response of \"sensitive\" and \"ordinary\" plants is essentially similar, and explain the mechanisms behind the heliotropic adjustments, including the role of light, temperature, and the motor organ's response to stimuli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
