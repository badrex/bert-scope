They found that the type of product formed spectroscopically depends on the polarity and reactivity of the solvent. In solvents of low polarity, large yields of the triplet state of the solute are produced, while in solvents of intermediate polarity, higher yields of anions and neutral radicals are obtained. The results provide insights into the mechanism of formation of free radicals in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
