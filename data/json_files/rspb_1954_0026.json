They find that adaptation involves the selective growth of mutated cells that can efficiently utilize galactose, rather than a gradual development in the entire population. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of yeast adaptation and the role of mutation in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
