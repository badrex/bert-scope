They discovered that the thermal history of the crystal significantly affects its reactivity, with two distinct patterns of behavior observed. The authors found that dislocations play a crucial role in the reactivity of the solid, with the change in the stereochemical environment of molecules in the dislocated region of the crystal being important.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
