The authors investigate the relative cross-sections for ionization as a function of the laboratory energy of the electrons and obtain consistent results with published values. They also discuss the apparatus and experimental procedure, including the electron gun, interaction region, and data acquisition methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
