The author explains how lysozyme's active site interacts with multiple sugar units, leading to different complex formations. The study reveals that the enzyme's reactivity depends on the number of sugar units bound, and the cleavage patterns vary based on the oligosaccharide's length.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
