Fowler's work on distinguishing between ordinary and enhanced spectrum lines, identifying titanium oxide in third type stars, and collaborating with Lord Rayleigh to prove the role of atmospheric ozone in solar and stellar spectra, have been crucial in advancing the understanding of celestial bodies. His research on atomic and stellar spectra, as well as his classification of spectrum lines, have been foundational in modern astrophysics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
