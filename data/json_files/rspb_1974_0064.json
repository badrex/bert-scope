By stimulating denervated soleus muscles with different patterns, the researchers found that muscles stimulated at 100 Hz acquired properties characteristic of fast muscles, while those stimulated at 10 Hz remained slow. This demonstrates the importance of the pattern of muscle activity in determining contractile properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
