They discovered that the fermentation of various carbohydrates by bacteria is brought about by a single set of enzymes, with different intermediate substances being produced during the process. The experiment also showed that the production of lactic acid ceases during the period of bacterial death.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
