The team observed significant microseismic activity and studied the ice-shelf's elevation, temperature, and accumulation. They also examined atmospheric behavior, solar radiation, and ozone layer changes. The results provided insights into the ice-shelf's geological structure and the surrounding environment's energy balance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
