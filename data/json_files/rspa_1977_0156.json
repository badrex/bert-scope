They discovered at least 125 new calcium lines and found evidence of multi-electron excitation processes. The study used Hartree-Fock calculations to interpret the spectrum and understand the role of electron correlation in the valence and subvalence shells.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
