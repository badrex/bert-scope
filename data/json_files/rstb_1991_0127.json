The model considers the effects of fox population heterogeneity, timing of the outbreak, size of the control area, and delay in control operations on the probability of eliminating rabies. The results suggest that high-density urban areas require high levels of control to successfully contain the disease, and a delay in control operations can reduce the chances of containing the disease by 10-20%. Increasing the size of the control zone increases the chances of successfully containing the disease, but this effect is density-dependent.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology", "sub_discipline": "Urban Ecology"}
