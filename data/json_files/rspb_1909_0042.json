The trypanosome is similar in shape to Trypanosoma brucei but has a well-developed undulating membrane and uniform size. The researchers could not definitively identify its species but guessed it might be Trypanosoma soudanense. They emphasized the importance of standardizing methods for fixing, staining, and measuring trypanosomes to improve identification and classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
