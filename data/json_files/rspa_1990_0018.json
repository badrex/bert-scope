It analyzes the development of the solution and the effects of temperature variations on the flow. The study finds that a steady-state flow is established when the temperature increases away from the origin, while unsteady flow can develop a singularity at a finite time, leading to an eruption of fluid from the boundary layer into the main body of the fluid. The article also discusses the role of the Grashof number and the Prandtl number in the flow dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
