They tested the method on arsenic trioxide and found that the molecular moment was relatively small, supporting the theory of permanent dipoles. Further improvements to the experiment are needed to study more substances and explore different orientations of molecules in the electric field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Molecular Physics"}
