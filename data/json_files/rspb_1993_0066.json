Researchers found that dominant males, who maintained positions near females for longer periods, had a higher paternity rate. However, the reproductive success of these males was not as great as their behavioral domination of mating opportunities would suggest. This could be due to factors such as imprecision in estimating copulatory opportunities or opportunities for subordinate males to mate with receptive females.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammal reproduction"}
