Matthiessen, conducted experiments to determine the expansion of metals and alloys by weighing them in water at different temperatures. The study focused on the expansion of copper, as well as various other metals and alloys. The results provided formulas for the correction of linear and cubical expansion for temperature in copper and other metals. This research helped improve understanding of the physical properties of metals and their behavior under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
