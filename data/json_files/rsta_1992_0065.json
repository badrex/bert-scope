The researchers used a photosensitive precursor of GTP (caged GTP) to study the structural changes in the protein during GTP hydrolysis. The results provide insights into the protein's active and resting states, as well as the mechanism of oncogenic transformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
