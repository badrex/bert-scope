The results show that endotoxins can significantly alter the serum's ability to enhance the immune system's ability to recognize and eliminate bacteria. The research also compares the effects of different endotoxin doses and strains on the opsonizing action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
