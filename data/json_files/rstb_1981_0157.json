It compares and analyzes various models for controlling the number of segments in vertebrate somite formation and explores the mechanisms behind the formation of periodic patterns in different organisms. The article highlights the similarities and differences between metameric segmentation patterns and other types of periodic patterns in animal development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
