They establish conditions for the finiteness and infiniteness of bound states, which correspond to eigenvalues below the essential spectrum of the operator. The study provides insights into the behavior of atoms and molecules and helps understand their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
