Cayley discusses the invariants and covariants of binary quintics, continuing his previous research on quantics. It explores the theory of equation determination, the bicorn curve, and the Tschirnhausen transformation. Cayley also presents new criteria for the character of a quintic equation and a theorem on imaginary linear transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
