The author derives expressions for the forces between macroscopic bodies and considers the effects of adsorbed surface layers. Approximate expressions are given for non-retarded dispersion forces in terms of refractive indices and absorption frequencies of materials. The results are useful for calculating van der Waals forces in colloidal and biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
