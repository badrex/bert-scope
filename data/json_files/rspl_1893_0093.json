They observe the ingestion of various particles, including proteins, pigments, and bacteria, and describe the rearrangement of these particles within the vacuoles. The author proposes a hypothesis that a viscous substance within the vacuole may be responsible for dragging solid particles together during the aggregation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology"}
