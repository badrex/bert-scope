The authors demonstrate how entropy and information are closely related and how multivariate analysis can be used to extract independent sources of information from experimental data. They provide several examples, including stress analysis, time-dependent spectroscopy, and elemental mapping by X-ray radiography, to illustrate the usefulness of data analysis in understanding complex systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
