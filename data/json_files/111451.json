He introduces the concept of matrices as sets of linear equations and discusses their properties, such as addition, multiplication, and the formation of powers and functions. Cayley also presents a theorem that demonstrates the relationship between matrices and algebraic equations, and discusses the applications of this theory, including finding convertible matrices and extending notions to rectangular matrices.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra"}
