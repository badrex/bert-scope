They used a new method of preparing plants and a solution of bichloride of mercury to study the effects on plant tissues. The results showed that the bichloride of mercury was absorbed into the intercellular and intervascular spaces, but not within the cells or vessels. This method helped in understanding the movement of sap in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
