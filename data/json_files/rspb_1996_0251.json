Researchers found that incubating a clutch of three eggs, instead of two, reduced the parents' ability to provision their brood of two. This demonstrates a trade-off between reproductive phases and shows that increased incubation costs can significantly impact parental performance, especially in lower quality pairs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
