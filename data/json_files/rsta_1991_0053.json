The authors discuss the role of fluids in transporting elements from the subducted slab to the mantle wedge and how this contributes to the growth of the Earth's continental crust. They also examine the importance of the slab-derived flux and the wedge-derived flux in determining the chemical budget of subduction zones.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Geochemistry"}
