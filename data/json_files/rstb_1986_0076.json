The authors find that while a high intrinsic rate of increase is important, other factors such as the impact of natural enemies and the carrying capacity of the environment also play a significant role in determining invasion success. The study highlights the importance of considering multiple factors when studying the invasion and establishment of species in ecological communities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
