It highlights the discovery of the heat-stable coenzyme uridine-diphospho-glucose and its role in the galactowaldenase system. The main pathway of lactose synthesis in the mammary gland is outlined, and the enzyme systems involved are examined. The article also explores the use of enzymes like hexokinase, phosphoglucomutase, and galactosyl transferase in lactose synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
