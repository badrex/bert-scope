They propose a model that explains how specific attractions and non-specific repulsions between chromosomes drive their movement. The study also highlights the role of centrosomes and the spindle in chromosome positioning and movement, providing insights into the genetic mechanisms of cell division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
