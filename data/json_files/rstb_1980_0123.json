They studied the dynamics of protein hydration by analyzing the Doppler-like broadening of the quasi-elastic line at various sub-monolayer hydration levels. The results showed oscillatory behavior in the hydration structure, which was explained using a Chudley-Elliott jump diffusion model. This research provided insights into the molecular-level understanding of protein hydration and its dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
