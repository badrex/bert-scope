They present a case history of fatigue cracking in the subconductors of large generator stators, outlining the investigation of the failures and the measures taken to allow operation in the short term while implementing a replacement program. The importance of rapid fracture mechanics analysis and on-load condition monitoring in assessing plant safety is emphasized.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
