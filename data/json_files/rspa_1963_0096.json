They found that the main contribution to the cross-section comes from collisions yielding a high scattered velocity and low ejected velocity. The results provide a better understanding of the physical processes occurring in plasmas and have implications for astrophysical problems, such as determining the electron temperature of the solar corona.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
