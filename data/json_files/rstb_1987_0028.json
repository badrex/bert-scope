The author grades 37 superfamilies of Lamellibranchia based on their structural condition and investigates their organ systems. The classification system proposed in this study is in general agreement with the Treatise on Invertebrate Paleontology but with some modifications. The author provides a model for the probable course of evolution within the Bivalvia class and offers a more sensitive method for classifying and revising the classification as needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Malacology"}
