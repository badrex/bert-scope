The author derives equations describing the detailed structure of these shocks and analyzes their solutions in special cases of high and low electrical conductivity. The study of magneto-hydrodynamic shock waves has implications for understanding plasma behavior and applications in space and fusion research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma physics"}
