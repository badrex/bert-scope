The author measures the ratios of Young's Modulus for various metals between the temperatures of liquid air and 10\u00b0C. The results show that more infusible metals are less affected by temperature, suggesting a possible relationship between melting points and the variation of elastic constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
