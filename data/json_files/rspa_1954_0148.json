The method uses complex variables and analytic functions to determine the velocity distribution near the cylinder and the lift and drag acting on it. The author applies this method to the case of a uniform flow past an elliptic cylinder at an arbitrary angle of incidence, providing analytical expressions for the lift and drag coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
