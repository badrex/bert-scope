The author confirms previous observations on the structure and function of lymph-hearts and investigates the effects of electrical currents on their rhythm. The study also explores the role of the spinal cord in controlling the lymph-heart's rhythm and the impact of sensory stimuli on their function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
