The lamb had no eyes, nose, or mouth, and its brain and nerves were missing. The author suggests that the growth of animals in the uterus may be independent of the brain's sensation organs, and further study of such cases could lead to significant discoveries in the field of physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
