Ritual behaviors, such as smiling, kissing, and hugging, help establish social relations and promote the infant's social capacity, which is essential for survival and reproduction. These behaviors also act to reduce anxiety and aggression in the infant when separated from the mother and increase the chances of effective mother-infant interactions."}
