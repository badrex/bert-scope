The authors discuss genetic polymorphism, population structure, and the balance between migration and selection in the evolution of bivalve molluscs. They also examine the role of environmental gradients, dispersal modes, and habitat exploitation in shaping genetic differentiation and variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
