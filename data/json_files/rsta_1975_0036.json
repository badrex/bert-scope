The Western Province has rocks ranging from Lower Palaeozoic to Miocene, with marked unconformities beneath the Upper Cretaceous and the Eocene strata. The Central Province is dominated by three fault or monoclinal structures and has rocks ranging from Jurassic to Eocene age. The Eastern Province is a relatively stable area dominated by a Tertiary syncline and a continuation of the Wealden anticline. The authors propose a geological evolution of the Channel, attempting to place its geology within the context of Western European geology.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
