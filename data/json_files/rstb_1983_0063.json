The study found that depressed mood increases the accessibility of negative memories and decreases the accessibility of positive memories. The results suggest that mood can influence memory retrieval and may play a role in the maintenance of depression. The findings support the idea of state-dependent learning, where memories are more easily retrieved when the mood state during retrieval matches the mood state during encoding.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
