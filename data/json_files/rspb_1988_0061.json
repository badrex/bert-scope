The researchers discovered that one type of potassium current is reduced by 4-aminopyridine (4-AP) and tetraethylammonium ion (TEA), while the second type is relatively insensitive to 4-AP but blocked by TEA. These findings contribute to the understanding of the electrical properties of satellite cells in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
