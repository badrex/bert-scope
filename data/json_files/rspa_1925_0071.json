They found that rapid deformation by shock produces distinct dark bands, which correspond to Neumann lines, while slow deformation results in slip bands. The relationship between slip bands and Neumann lines suggests that the latter are not twin layers. The true nature of Neumann lines remains uncertain, but they may be bundles of fine slip bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
