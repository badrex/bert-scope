They propose that the water used by the mollusk for distending its foot comes into the body through the organ of BOJANUS and gains access to the interior of the blood vessels. The water then transudes into the system of water-tubes and exits through these tubes under normal conditions. The authors also discuss the method by which the animal disencumbers itself of ingested fluid and provide evidence for their views through various experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mollusk Biology"}
