They used dynamical reflection high-energy electron diffraction calculations to investigate various aspects of RHEED intensity oscillations, including growth rate, alloy composition, interface effects, and control of quantum well widths. This study provides insights into the formation of heteroepitaxial structures and their applications in semiconductors, metals, and insulators."}
