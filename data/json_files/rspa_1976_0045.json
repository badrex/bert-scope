They find that the vacuum expectation value of the tensor exhibits a non-vanishing radiation flux for an arbitrary mirror trajectory. The calculation requires a regularization procedure of covariant separation of points along time-like geodesics. The study of this simple model system provides insight into more sophisticated processes, such as particle production in cosmological models and exploding black holes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
