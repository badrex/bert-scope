They describe these constructions by defining sets of fundamental vectors and glue vectors for each of the 23 classes of holes or Niemeier lattices. The Leech lattice is closely related to the 23 Niemeier lattices, and this work provides a better understanding of the connections between these mathematical structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
