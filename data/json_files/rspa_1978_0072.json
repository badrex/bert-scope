They confirmed the results of the Jones-Richards experiment, showing that the momentum associated with electromagnetic radiation increases directly with the refractive index of the medium. The experiment also demonstrated that the magnitude of recoil of a mirror in oblique incidence does not vary when the plane of polarization is changed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
