The positions of the iron atoms in the hem groups are confirmed, and the structure is compared to myoglobin. The detailed structure provides insights into the assembly of the molecule and its relationship to the amino acid sequences of human and horse hemoglobin and sperm-whale myoglobin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
