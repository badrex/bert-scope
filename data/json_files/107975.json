F. Daniell, describes the design, construction, and operation of a water-barometer, an instrument used to study atmospheric pressure and tides. The water-barometer consists of a long glass tube filled with water and sealed at the top, which is suspended vertically. The author explains the process of boiling water in the tube to remove air and ensure accurate measurements. This innovative instrument allowed for more precise observations of atmospheric pressure and contributed to the understanding of meteorological phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Meteorology"}
