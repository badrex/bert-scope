The author demonstrates that different degrees of mineralization lead to different sets of mechanical properties, which are adaptive in most cases. The article also discusses the challenges in modeling the mechanical behavior of bone and the need for further research to understand the relationship between mineral content and bone properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
