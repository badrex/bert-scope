The author finds that deciduous trees have a higher specific conductivity than evergreens, and that their wood structure is more efficient and adaptable to their environment. This plasticity allows deciduous trees to thrive in various environments, including tropical regions with alternating seasons.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Plant Science"}
