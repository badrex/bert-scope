By analyzing the genetic sequences of these viruses, researchers can reconstruct the spread of the diseases and understand the factors that shape their patterns of diversification. The study highlights the potential of this approach to inform public health strategies and improve our understanding of disease transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Epidemiology"}
