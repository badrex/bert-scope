They found that the disease was not kala-azar or beri-beri, but was closely related to Malta fever. The researchers identified the causative agent as Micrococcus melitensis and proved that goats were reservoirs of the virus, which spread to humans through the consumption of contaminated goat milk. This discovery helped in understanding the transmission and treatment of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Infectious Diseases"}
