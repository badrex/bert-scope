The fungi's growth progresses in a circular pattern, and other plants struggle to grow within the ring due to the lack of nutrients. The author also observes that different species of fungi require the same nutrients, causing interference between circles when they overlap.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
