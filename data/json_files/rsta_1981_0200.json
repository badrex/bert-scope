The focus is on the narrow, eccentric rings, which present complex dynamical problems. The author explores the gravitational action of small satellites on the orbits of ring particles and the various factors that contribute to the structure and origin of these rings.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
