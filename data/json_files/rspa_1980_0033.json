They found that the metal Auger intensity ratios can be used as a probe to determine the oxidation state of a metal, with the ratio decreasing as the oxidation state increases. This technique can be applied to investigate the surface oxidation of various metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
