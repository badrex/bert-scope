They find that the morning maximum of pressure generally coincides with the instant of most rapid temperature increase, while the evening maximum often coincides with a minimum in the diurnal variation of cloud and rainfall. These findings suggest that atmospheric compression and dynamic heating of cloud-forming strata may play a role in these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
