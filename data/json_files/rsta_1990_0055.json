The researchers found that the dissolution rate increases with the degree of undersaturation in the bottom water. They used a mathematical model and field data from a 5430-depth Atlantic site to explore the applicability of their method. The results provide insights into the preservation of carbonate minerals in deep-sea sediments and its relation to atmospheric carbon dioxide levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
