They discuss the influence of viviparity and yolk accumulation on development and the general biology of these forms. The study reveals differences in development between various Molgulid species, with some exhibiting direct development and others having a tadpole-like larva.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Developmental Biology"}
