The Rockall flight focused on observing birds on Rockall, St Kilda, and North Rona, while the Seal flight aimed to find grey seal colonies and estimate their population. The research provided valuable insights into bird and seal distribution, breeding patterns, and habitat preferences, and demonstrated the potential of aerial surveys for wildlife observation and conservation efforts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
