The authors apply these concepts to the self-dual Yang-Mills equations in Euclidean 4-space and compute the number of moduli for any compact gauge group. They also discuss the relation between self-duality and holomorphic structures, and explore the moduli space of self-dual connections and their applications to various Lie groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
