Researchers found that when roots are cultured in an iron-deficient medium, growth ceases after seven days due to a halt in cell division. The synthesis of amino acids continues, but they accumulate in mature cells instead of being used for new cell formation. The study also suggests a possible link between the cessation of cell division and the activity of a cytochrome oxidase system, which may require a minimal amount of iron for cell formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
