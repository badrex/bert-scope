It presents case studies and wind tunnel investigations to understand the air flow patterns and wind speeds around buildings. The research provides a design method for planning the layout of small groups of buildings and offers insights into future research needs.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Urban Planning and Design"}
