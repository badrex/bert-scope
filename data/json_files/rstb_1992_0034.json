The authors studied moths and dung and carrion beetles, finding that moth diversity significantly decreases with disturbance and conversion, while beetles show less change in their faunistic composition. The study highlights the importance of conserving lowland forest habitats to protect insect species and overall tropical forest biodiversity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
