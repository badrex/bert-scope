They discuss various properties, such as dielectric properties, electrical conductivity, proton magnetic resonance, mechanical relaxation, and self-diffusion, and propose that the observed time-independence of the ionic conductivity is due to the presence of ions and Bjerrum defects in ice crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystal Physics"}
