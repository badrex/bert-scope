They discuss the effects of assigning an absolute value to stress and the contribution of stress to gravitational mass, and propose a modification to the physical interpretation of the tensor. This new interpretation helps to relate the work to other parts of physical theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
