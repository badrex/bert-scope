The black, insoluble substance is reduced with a slight explosion when heated and has fulminating properties when soaked in ammonia. Davy also analyzed the compound and found it to consist mainly of platinum, oxygen, and nitrous acid elements. Additionally, he described the action of sulfate of platinum on solutions of jelly and a grey oxide of platinum obtained by the action of nitrous acid on fulminating platinum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
