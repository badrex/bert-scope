This technique involves using a filter paper disc with an albuminous fluid on a cover-glass, floated on a hypertonic salt solution. The resulting streaming effects, called inter-traction, can be observed and analyzed. This research expands upon previous studies on inter-traction and its mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
