It examines the impact of climatic, tectonic, and oceanographic changes on the Arctic Ocean and its ice cover, and explores the connection between the Arctic and global climate systems. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the Arctic's past to predict future climate scenarios under the influence of human-driven global warming.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Change and Paleoclimatology"}
