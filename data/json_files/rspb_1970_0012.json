The research found that the axons of primary photoreceptor cells in the compound eye of the fly form a complex but precise pattern before terminating on second-order neurons. The study also highlights the accuracy of the chiasma, where bundles from the lamina pass to project in reverse order onto the medulla, with no errors of projection found at the single neuron level.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
