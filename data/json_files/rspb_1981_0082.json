They propose a mechanism by which statolith movement influences auxin transport, leading to a downward diversion of auxin when a plant is tilted. This mechanism explains the geotropism observed in plants, where shoots bend to maintain their original growth direction when tilted. The study provides insights into the cellular processes involved in plant growth and response to gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
