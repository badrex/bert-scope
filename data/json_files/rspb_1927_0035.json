It explains how a runner's speed affects the number of muscle fibers needed to perform a task, and how this can lead to greater energy expenditure and waste. The article also discusses the concept of an \"optimal speed\" for completing a given task, and how this can vary depending on the type of exercise.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
