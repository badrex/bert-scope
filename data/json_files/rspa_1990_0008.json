They find that the predictions of both theories are similar in certain cases, and the rate sensitive approach provides unique solutions for slip distributions and grain rotations. The study helps in understanding crystal plasticity and texture development in polycrystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
