The author suggests that first-order tectonic phenomena should now be detectable, and that a wide range of geological techniques will be needed to solve the problem and assess its broader implications. The study covers the time interval of about 2000 Ma (from 2600 to ca.600 Ma b.p.) and provides a density of coverage of about 1 per 10 Ma worldwide.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
