They found that the Indian strain of Leishmania does not develop in these sandflies as readily as Chinese strains, with a significantly lower infection rate and different infection patterns. This suggests a biological distinction between the two strains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
