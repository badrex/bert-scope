They used the method of retrograde cell degeneration to investigate the organization of the afferent fibers from the LGN to the visual cortex. The results showed a well-defined topical organization in the geniculo-cortical projection, with anterior parts of the nucleus projecting anteriorly and posterior parts projecting posteriorly. The study also found that the three cyto-architectonic subdivisions of the cat's visual cortex (areas 17, 18, and 19) receive differential afferent connections from the LGN.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual System"}
