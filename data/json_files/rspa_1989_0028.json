They found that both types of scale grew at the oxide-gas interface, with substantial growth occurring in the inner half of the inner layer. The results provide insights into the corrosion process and help improve the understanding of the behavior of ferritic steels in high-pressure carbon dioxide environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Materials Science and Engineering"}
