The reptile had a specialized skull and was adapted for a semi-erect gait. It is found in aeolian sands and its skeletons show little physical disturbance. Hyperodapedon is part of a close taxonomic group of rhynchosaurs from the late Triassic period, distinct from those of the middle Triassic. The study also discusses the ecological role of rhynchosaurs and their relationships to other reptiles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
