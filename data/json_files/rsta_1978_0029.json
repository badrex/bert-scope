They found that the equilibrium solubility of alumina in enstatite is lower than previous studies, leading to uncertainties in estimated palaeogeotherms. This may result in spurious kinks in the apparent geotherms, affecting the estimation of pressures and temperatures of mineral assemblages in rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
