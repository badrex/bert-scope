They criticize previous methods for their arbitrary choice of values and inefficient estimation techniques, and propose a more accurate approach using statistical methods. This analysis provides a deeper understanding of the comparative anatomy and ontogenetic and phylogenetic development of the vertebrate brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
