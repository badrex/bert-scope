They find that these particles are accelerated efficiently to high energies and achieve power-law spectra. The gravitational energy of the inflowing matter is effectively transferred to high-energy particles, which can help explain non-thermal phenomena associated with accreting astronomical objects and the collapse of red giants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
