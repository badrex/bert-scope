The authors conducted experiments on rabbits and frogs, observing the accumulation of the dye in the tubules and analyzing urine samples. Their findings suggest that phenolsulphonephthalein can pass into the tubules either by diffusion or secretion, providing evidence for the role of the renal tubule in its elimination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
