They find that the potential falls to low values when the ratio of negative ions to electrons exceeds 2. The authors also explore the potential distribution and ion currents in the region outside a positive ion sheath for various negative-ion to electron ratios.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
