This technique allows for more accurate measurements of hydrodynamic forces and can be applied to submarines and surface ships. The planar motion mechanism is a powerful tool for testing models of ships and submarines, and this new approach offers a more versatile and economical method for measuring hydrodynamic forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ocean Engineering"}
