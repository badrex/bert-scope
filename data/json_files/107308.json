They discovered that serum contains albumen combined with a large proportion of alkali, which can be separated using electrical decomposition. The study also found that gelatine does not exist in the serum, and the serosity is a compound of albumen with excess alkali.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
