Hauksbee conducted an experiment to study the propagation of sound in a controlled environment with a vacuum. He found that sound was still transmitted, albeit weaker, when the environment was almost entirely devoid of air. This demonstrated the importance of air in the propagation of sound.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
