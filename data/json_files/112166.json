They used two pendulums, marked No. 1821 and No. 4, and made adjustments to the experimental setup to ensure accurate readings. The observations aimed to help improve the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India by understanding the impact of the mountains on gravity's intensity and direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
