They found that flies can recognize and remember visual patterns, and their preference for new patterns over familiar ones can be explained by a graded similarity function. This function is independent of the geometrical properties of the employed figures and suggests that visual pattern memory at this basic level does not require shape analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Psychology"}
