S. Krishnan, discovered that when monochromatic light is scattered in a transparent medium, new radiations with different frequencies appear in the scattered radiation. These new radiations are often strongly polarized and can be used to study molecular vibrations and energy levels. The phenomenon of induced emission is also demonstrated through these experiments, proving the existence of molecules at higher energy levels and their ability to return to normal states upon exposure to light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
