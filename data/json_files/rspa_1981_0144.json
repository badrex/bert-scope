The author demonstrates how this method can represent transition amplitudes for boson fields using functional integrals over the classical phase space, and also constructs an analogous representation for fermion fields. The geometric quantization approach offers advantages in generalizing to nonlinear problems involving self-interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
