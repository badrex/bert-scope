They found that the rate of bromination is independent of the bromine concentration and is determined by the rate at which the ester loses a proton to basic ions or molecules in the solution. The study provides insights into the catalytic constants of various basic species and their role in the reaction. This work extends previous research on the base-catalyzed prototropy of substituted ketones and contributes to the understanding of reaction kinetics in organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
