They find that symbiotic algae do not show characteristics of nutrient deficiency, such as decreased chlorophyll levels and photosynthetic rates, as they release substantial photosynthate. The author suggests that the host may regulate the symbiont population by restricting nutrient supply, rather than the symbionts being nutrient deficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
