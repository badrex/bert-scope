The authors discovered that breaking a magnetic circuit can create another closed circuit, and that tension strengthens the magnetization while pressure weakens it. They also found that the attractive force of an electromagnet in a closed magnetic circuit can increase over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
