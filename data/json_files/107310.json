This compound has unique properties, such as being an acid, decomposing when exposed to water, and having a strong affinity for ammonia. The compound's formation and properties were studied through various experiments, and it was found to be different from previously known compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Reactions"}
