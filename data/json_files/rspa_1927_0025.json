The author considers two special cases of molecular packing: a simple square network and an equi-triangular network. The results show that the mutual potential energy differs by only about 2% between the two cases, allowing for a fairly accurate estimate of the energy for various modes of molecular packing.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
