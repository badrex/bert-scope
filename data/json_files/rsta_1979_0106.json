The author reviews the thermodynamics of these transitions and presents two approximate methods for analyzing the interaction between acoustic modes and soft modes in crystals. The article highlights the importance of light scattering spectroscopy in understanding these phase transitions and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
