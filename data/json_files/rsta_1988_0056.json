It explores how nuclear-fusion reactions in stars produce elements and isotopes, and how mass loss from stars returns processed matter to the interstellar medium. The article also examines the discovery of isotopic anomalies in meteorites, which has changed the understanding of the Solar System's formation and composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Cosmochemistry"}
