Ionization in Hydrogen Flames", "semantic_tags": ["Mass spectrometry", "Ionization", "Flames", "Hydrogen flames", "Ion analysis"], "tldr": "The authors developed an apparatus to extract and analyze ions from flames, specifically hydrogen flames. They found that hydroxonium was the most evident positive ion, with other important ions being and. The ionization of nitric oxide was shown to be essentially a thermal phenomenon. The study provides insights into the ionization processes occurring in flames and the nature of the ions produced.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
