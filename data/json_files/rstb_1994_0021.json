The results show that bees can effectively differentiate the orientation of unidirectional patterns, such as stripes and gratings, and learn to prefer the orientation associated with a reward. However, they struggle with discriminating the orientation of right-angled crosses or plaids. The findings suggest that honeybees' visual system analyzes orientation similarly to the mammalian cortex, involving at least three orientation-sensitive channels with different preferred orientations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Insect Vision"}
