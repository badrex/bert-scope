They found that at lower energies, the effect of screening is more important, and large polarization may occur in narrow energy regions for heavy atoms like gold. The study confirms that introducing screening does not modify the polarization at high energies, but it can significantly affect lower energy regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
