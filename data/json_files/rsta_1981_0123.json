It examines the constraints on continental crust development from about 3.8 billion years ago and highlights the importance of understanding the Earth's thermal history and mantle differentiation processes. The article also explores the geochemical reservoirs that make up the continental crust and mantle, and how they interact over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
