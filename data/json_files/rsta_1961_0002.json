They show that solutions for the propagation of ionization fronts can be made unique and discuss the importance of strong-type and weak-type ionization fronts. The study also examines the conflict with the Chapman-Jouguet hypothesis and the reasons behind this behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
