They use a glass fibre suspension to measure the cataphoretic velocity and investigate the flow of liquid through a pipe of rectangular cross-section. The results support Smoluchowski's equation, providing insights into the understanding of cataphoresis and its applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
