He worked on developing direction-finding equipment and long-distance short-wave links, and conducted research on the propagation of waves through the ionosphere, scattering of waves from the ionosphere, and the origin of naturally occurring radio waves called whistlers. His work on wave propagation was highly original and sometimes difficult to follow, which may have led to his ideas not receiving the recognition they deserved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
