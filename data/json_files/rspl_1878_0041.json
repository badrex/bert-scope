They found that filtration through spongy iron can remove putrefactive agents from water and hay infusion, preventing the growth of bacteria and putrefaction. This demonstrates that spongy iron can be used as a method for purifying water and protecting against the spread of disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Water Treatment and Quality"}
