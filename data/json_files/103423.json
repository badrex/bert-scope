He discovered that the magnetic force decreases faster at greater distances and found that touched needles have multiple poles, which he called \"consequential poles.\" He also explored the attraction of fluids and the separation of thin wooden boards from water surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
