They demonstrate that, although mass transport occurs only along the field lines, heat transport cannot be confined only in the direction of the magnetic field. The study estimates a finite cross-field heat flux that can be driven by collisions between like particles at the limit, leading to a modification of the classical dependence of thermal conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
