The author discusses various methods for measuring respiratory quotient in vitro and provides experimental data on respiratory quotients of 5th day yolk-sac in Ringer-phosphate-glucose and embryos in amniotic liquid plus glucose.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
