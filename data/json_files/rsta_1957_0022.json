The research team, led by A. H. Cook and N. W. B. Stone, aimed to improve the accuracy of the temperature scale by determining the boiling point of water under a specified pressure. They used a mercury barometer to measure pressure and a pycnometer to determine the volume of mercury. The results provide a more accurate understanding of mercury density and contribute to the improvement of the temperature scale.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
