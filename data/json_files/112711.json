They discovered that these fibers are more extensive than previously thought and that they mainly run longitudinally in the convolutions. The study also found that some convolutions have no direct connection with the central ganglia or corpus callosum, which may explain the association of language loss with damage to the left hemisphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroanatomy"}
