The problem is reduced to a pair of two-dimensional scalar problems, and the solution is obtained by using a Tschplygin transformation to convert the boundary value problem into one in potential theory. The findings provide a better understanding of the behavior of electromagnetic waves in complex geometries.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
