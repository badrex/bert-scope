They found that R\u00f6ntgen rays can rapidly discharge electrification in both positively and negatively charged bodies. The author also discovered that these rays can produce noticeable effects on charged plates even after passing through thick materials like zinc plates. This research helps in understanding the behavior of R\u00f6ntgen rays and their potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
