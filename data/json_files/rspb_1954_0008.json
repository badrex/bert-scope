They observed the sequence of tissue regression and the involvement of leucocytes in breaking down necrotic tissue and phagocytosis. The study also examined the potential for maternal sensitization to foetal antigens during the regression process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
