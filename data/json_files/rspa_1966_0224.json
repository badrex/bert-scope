The method is applicable to randomly branched polymer systems, ideal copolymerization of monomers, and radiation crosslinking of linear chains. The calculations focus on the sol fraction of the system after the gel point, considering the effects of chemical substitution and different sizes of functional units on the mean square radius. The article also introduces a new method of converting vectors to scalars and provides a detailed explanation of the notation and mathematical concepts used in the calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
