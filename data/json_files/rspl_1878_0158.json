He discovers that the molecular rays can be deflected and even rotate under the influence of a magnet. The experiments also reveal that the behavior of these rays is different at high and low exhaustions, providing insights into the nature of molecular physics and the potential applications of this knowledge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
