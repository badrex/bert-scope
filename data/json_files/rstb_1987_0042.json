The experiment shows that even after 15 months, diesel-based cuttings are more toxic to benthic fauna than low-toxicity oil-based cuttings. The results suggest that low-toxicity muds may have less impact on the environment compared to diesel-based muds.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Pollution"}
