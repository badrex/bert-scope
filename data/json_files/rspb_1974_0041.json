They found that both components are capable of steroid metabolism and that whole tissue incubations alone can be misleading. The study helps to understand the different physiological roles of steroids produced by each component and their potential involvement in male reproductive system diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Reproductive Biology"}
