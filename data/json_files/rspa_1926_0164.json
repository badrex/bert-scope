They discovered that the phase relation between ground and atmospheric waves changes significantly at night, and the natural signal variations observed during their experiments were attributed to changes in the ionized layer. The results provided evidence for the existence of the Kennelly-Heaviside layer and demonstrated its role in radio wave propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
