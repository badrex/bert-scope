The research focuses on the properties of the conduction system and the characteristics of the arrest response. The findings show that these sponges have a conduction system with excitability properties similar to nerve and muscle, but they do not have a nervous system. The conducting tissue is likely the trabecular net, which is distributed throughout the sponge.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Sponge Biology"}
