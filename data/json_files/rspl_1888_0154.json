They found that the coefficient ranges from 0.0048 at ordinary temperatures to 0.018 at a temperature just short of 855\u00b0C. The author also observed that at 870\u00b0C, the iron wire loses its magnetism, which coincides with a discontinuity in the resistance curve. This research was conducted at seven stations in India.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
