They describe the movement of sediment southward along the English coast and northward along the Dutch coast, suggesting a counter-clockwise circulation in the North Sea. They also mention the presence of major sediment traps, such as the Wash and the Thames Estuary, and discuss the possibility of observing fossil topography in some sandwave fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
