The authors found that these molluscs primarily inhabit two types of reef locations: the crest of a semi-exposed reef and the flat of a sheltered or semi-sheltered reef. They also discovered various feeding habits among the opisthobranch species, including herbivory, carnivory, and specialized diets. The study provides valuable insights into the ecology of these fascinating creatures and their role in coral reef ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Marine Biology"}
