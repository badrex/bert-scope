The author examines the possible sources of milk proteins, including free amino acids and plasma proteins, and concludes that free amino acids are the primary precursors. The article also highlights the importance of the mammary gland in absorbing amino acids from the blood to synthesize milk proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
