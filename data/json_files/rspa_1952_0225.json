The authors deduce physical quantities such as mean free path, mean energy loss per collision, and collisional cross-sections of the molecules. The findings contribute to understanding related fields of study, such as high-frequency discharges, microwave discharges, the positive column, and the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas physics"}
