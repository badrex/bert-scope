Made of Woo-tung wood, the Kin has unique features that produce tones different from those of a violin. The author examines the complexity of learning to play the instrument and the challenges posed by the Chinese notation of written music. Despite these challenges, the performance on the Kin is graceful, and the author delves into the musical theory of the sounds produced by the instrument.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Musicology"}
