He explains that the iris has a membranous front layer and a muscular back layer, which work together to adjust the lens position and focus on objects. Home also describes the differences in eye structure between humans, quadrupeds, and birds, and how these differences affect their vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
