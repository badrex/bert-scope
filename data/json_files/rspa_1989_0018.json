By using Dingle's method of Borel summation, the author demonstrates that the changes in the function across a Stokes line are smooth and universal, regardless of the problem's specific context. This approach allows for better control of the dominant exponential contribution and provides a more accurate understanding of the underlying mathematical processes."}
