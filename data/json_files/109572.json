He also studied a new species of oxide of iron, which has a perfect cube form and is the last degree of oxidation in which iron retains the property of crystallizing in a regular form. The author provides a detailed description of the crystals, their properties, and their chemical analysis, as well as suggestions for distinguishing these new species from other similar substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
