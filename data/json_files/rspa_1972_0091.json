They found that the scavengers reduced the excited-state yields, with nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide systems showing similar behavior. The results suggest that ion-recombination processes play a significant role in the formation of excited states in irradiated cyclohexane solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiation Chemistry"}
