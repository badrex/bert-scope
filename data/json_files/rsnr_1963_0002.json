This period of intense religious awareness led him to confess his actions and thoughts, providing a glimpse into his young, unsophisticated puritan mindset. Newton's use of shorthand also allowed him to practice self-examination and conceal thoughts he wished to keep private.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
