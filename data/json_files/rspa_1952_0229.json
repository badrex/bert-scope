The method uses a pair of small wells with a pump to form a water-circulating system, and the difference in water levels is related to the rate of flow and soil permeability. This method can determine permeabilities in the directions of anisotropy and, when combined with another method, calculate axial permeabilities of triaxially anisotropic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Physics"}
