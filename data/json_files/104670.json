The author, Edward Wright, explains the unique behavior of the river's water flow during neap and spring tides, and how these irregular motions are caused by the river's numerous turnings and windings. The phenomenon is most noticeable during seasonable weather and has been observed for many years.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography and Coastal Sciences"}
