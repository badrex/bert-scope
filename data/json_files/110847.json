The findings show that the magnetic phenomena in the southern hemisphere exhibit a duplicate system similar to the northern hemisphere. The results confirm the conclusion that spaces in the Southern Pacific undergo a translation movement from east to west, which is opposite to the movement in the northern hemisphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
