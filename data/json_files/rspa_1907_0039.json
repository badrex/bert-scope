The formula is demonstrated with examples of 12-inch, 6-inch, and 0.303-inch projectiles, showing that the results closely align with actual practice. The study also discusses the relationship between the resistance, weight, and dimensions of projectiles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
