The author uses the method of dynamic similarity to derive exact formulae for stress and velocity components, considering the effects of different propagation velocities and relative densities of the two media. The study also discusses the non-uniform way in which the solution approaches the corresponding elastic half-space solution and the impact of relative density on surface wave velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
