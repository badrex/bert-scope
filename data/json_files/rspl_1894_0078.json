They found that exposure to daylight and fresh air rapidly reduced the virulence of the bacteria, while exposure to darkness and confined air maintained the bacteria's ability to cause infection. These findings have important implications for understanding the transmission of tuberculosis in different environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
