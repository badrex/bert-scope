The authors use the unsteady quasi-one-dimensional reactive Euler equations to analyze the competition between chemical energy release and frictional drag, which can lead to oscillatory detonation behavior and the non-existence of a steady wave solution. The research provides insights into the dynamics of detonation waves and their interaction with the surrounding environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
