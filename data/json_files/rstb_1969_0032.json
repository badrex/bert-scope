It highlights the factors that contribute to the distinctiveness of their floras, such as the differences in climate, substrate, and vegetation types. The study also emphasizes the greater age and isolation of New Caledonia's flora, which results in a higher level of endemism and a more relict nature compared to the Solomon Islands.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
