They emphasize the importance of understanding the causes of acidification and the potential consequences on aquatic life. The authors also debate the effectiveness of liming streams and the role of soil and rock chemistry in neutralizing acidity. They suggest that reducing acid precipitation may not immediately restore the situation and that a deeper understanding of soil and rock weathering is necessary for effective management.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
