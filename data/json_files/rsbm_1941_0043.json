He discovered the hexosemonophosphate, or Robison ester, which became a crucial substrate for studying carbohydrate metabolism in animal tissues. Additionally, Robinson made significant contributions to understanding the process of ossification through his research on bone mineralization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
