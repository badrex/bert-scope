They normalized their experimental curve to previous absolute cross-section measurements and compared it with Hartree-Fock and random phase approximation with exchange (rpa) calculations. The experimental maximum occurs at a lower energy than predicted by the theoretical models, indicating a systematic trend in photoionization from subshells with nodeless wavefunctions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
