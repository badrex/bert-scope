D. Liveing and J. Dewar, conducted experiments to study the reversal of lines of metallic vapours and their potential impact on celestial phenomena. They observed the absorption and reversal of lines in caesium, rubidium, and other metals when heated in various conditions. The authors concluded that the results could provide insights into the behavior of elements in mixtures and the nature of celestial phenomena in space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
