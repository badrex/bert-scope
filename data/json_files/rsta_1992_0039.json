They found that the detonation products were highly dependent on the ambient pressure of argon, with significant changes occurring between vacuum and atmospheric pressure. The results showed that argon behaves as a confining medium, influencing the reaction products and energy output of the explosives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
