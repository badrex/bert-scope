The research found that more predatory species have a greater number of neurons and larger cell bodies in the tectospinal tract compared to less predatory species within each mammalian order. This suggests a correlation between predatory habits and the evolution of the tectospinal tract in mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
