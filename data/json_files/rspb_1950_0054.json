It explores four main characteristics of plant form, including the relative development of stems and leaves, the tendency for secondary axes or branches to be produced, the size and shape of leaves, and the duration and growth of primary and secondary axes. The author also explains how external factors, such as light, temperature, and nutrition, can modify plant form and growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
