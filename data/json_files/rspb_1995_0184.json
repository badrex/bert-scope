They find a high level of synchrony in population fluctuations among different localities, with the degree of synchrony leveling off with increasing distance between populations. Climatic perturbations and dispersal are proposed as factors that may cause synchrony in population dynamics. The study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind population fluctuations and the role of spatial heterogeneity in shaping animal population dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
