The study reveals that twin maxima in the absorption spectra occur when negative iodine is linked to positive iodine, and the energy difference between these maxima is related to the difference between normal and excited states of iodine atoms. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of iodine in chemical compounds and the development of new materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
