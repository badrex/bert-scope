The results show an immediate increase in adrenaline content, followed by a loss of fluorescence and disintegration of the fibers. The findings suggest that the continued synthesis of adrenaline in the peripheral parts of the neurons, separated from their cell bodies, reveals a normal 'depletion' of nerve terminals due to a possible failure of the re-uptake mechanism for released adrenaline.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
