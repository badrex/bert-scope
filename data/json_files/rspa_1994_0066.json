They discovered that this process occurs when stress concentrations at the edges of a hard slider cause the softer surface to accumulate plastic deformation. This mechanism can happen under frictionless conditions and is responsible for the formation of thin wear particles in sliding contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
