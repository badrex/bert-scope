The rigidity assumption is introduced to constrain the interpretation and reduce the number of possible solutions. The scheme is applicable to both orthographic and perspective projections, providing a computational approach to understanding the perception of structure from motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Computer Science > Computer Vision"}
