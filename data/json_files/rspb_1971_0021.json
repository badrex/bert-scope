Using radiocarbon measurements, the researchers define a sequence of pollen assemblage zones and compare them with other dated sequences in north-west Europe. The findings provide insights into the synchroneity of vegetation changes and migration, succession, or climatic factors affecting the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Quaternary Research"}
