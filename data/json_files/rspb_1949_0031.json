The author argues against using the term \"myoglobin\" for different types of haemoglobin and suggests using the term \"chlorocruorin\" for invertebrate haemoglobin. The author also mentions hemerythrin, another oxygen-binding protein found in some invertebrates, and its relation to carbon monoxide exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
