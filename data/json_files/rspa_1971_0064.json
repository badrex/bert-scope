Two types of reactions are observed: preflame reactions, where particle heating rates are controlled by conduction from the gas and heat release at the particle surface, and reactions characterized by a highly luminous flame. The authors analyze the kinetics of both types of reactions using thermal explosion theory and oxygen transport rates. They also measure particle temperatures and emissivity to better understand the combustion process."}
