They observed the transition from subaerial to submarine lava flows and examined the role of sea water in the formation of pillows. The study provides insights into the evolution of the Earth's crust and the contribution of submarine lavas to the bulk chemistry of the hydrosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
