They propose macroscopic independent variables and explore dissipation processes from vortex motion, electric current, heat flux, and superelectron relaxation. The transport properties of type-II superconductors in the vortex state are also discussed in detail.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
