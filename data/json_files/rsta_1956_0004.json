They use the Manchester University Electronic Computer to obtain solutions for various particle radii, surface potentials, and particle separations. The results help in understanding the forces between colloidal particles and their impact on properties like diffusion, viscosity, and sedimentation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal chemistry"}
