Both homogeneous and inhomogeneous plane waves are considered, with a focus on the effects of electrical and magnetic anisotropy on wave behavior. The study provides a geometrical interpretation of wave properties using bivectors and their associated directional ellipses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
