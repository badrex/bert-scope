The authors demonstrate that different concentrations of activin and FGF can provide positional information for cells to form various mesodermal cell types. They also show that activin and FGF interact to establish the correct pattern of mesodermal cell types in the embryo.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
