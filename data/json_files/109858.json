He explained that the ice formed due to the river's temperature being at the freezing point and the accumulation of spicula in eddies caused by stones. Knight also expressed doubts about large masses of solid ice found at the bottoms of deep and sluggish rivers, as there is no obvious cause for their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
