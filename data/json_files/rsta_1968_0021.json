The authors propose a new contour, s.i. 70, which can be used as a filter network, a tangent-to-curve determiner, or an averaging curve to find an s.i.l. The new contour outperforms existing A weighting, n.c., n.c.a., and i.s.o. curves in predicting speech-interfering properties of noise. The authors plan to develop a set of contours at higher and lower decibel levels to rate spaces where noise levels exceed n.c. 55 but work must continue, including voice communications.", "scientific_discipline": "Acoustics > Noise Control"}
