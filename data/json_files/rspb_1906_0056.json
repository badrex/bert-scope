They examine the effects of various poisons on these tissues and argue that the traditional view of nerve endings being more susceptible to certain poisons may not be accurate. The author presents recent observations that challenge this theory and suggest a need for further investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
