The author, J. Haygarth, attributes this to the city's unique geographical features, such as its red sandstone rock foundation, which prevents stagnant moisture and putrefaction, and the Rows, covered galleries that keep the city's streets dry and clean. Other factors contributing to Chester's health include the presence of the River Dee, which washes away liquid filth and provides a source of fresh air, and the city's modern manners and refinement, which do not lead to the same health issues as gluttony and drunkenness.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Urban Planning and Design"}
