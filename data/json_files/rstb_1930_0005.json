The study covers various aspects of the animals' lives, including their habitat, food sources, and the role of oxygen in their survival. The author also discusses the different types of animals found in these environments and their unique adaptations to the swift currents and challenging conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
