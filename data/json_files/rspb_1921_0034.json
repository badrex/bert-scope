This occurs independently in the ventricles and does not indicate a partial removal of the heart block. The study suggests that this phenomenon might be due to a complete heart block between the auricles and ventricles, with the auricles continuing to beat regularly.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
