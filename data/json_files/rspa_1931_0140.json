They used a Jamin interferometer and a mercury vapor lamp to determine the refractive index for each substance in the gaseous state. The results provide a criterion for evaluating existing theories of paramagnetism and agree with Stoner's view on spin and orbital moments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
