They found that the change of magnetization produced by repeated actions and annullings of the magnetizing force was greater when the weight was off than on. This discovery was important for understanding the influence of iron structures on compass readings and the Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
