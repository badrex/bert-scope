They observe that the yearly secular change in dip is affected by disturbances, which tend to increase the inclination. The author compares the results with those from Toronto, indicating that the yearly change of dip contains the combined effect of true secular change and disturbance. This should be considered by future observers of this magnetic element.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
