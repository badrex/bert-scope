He then calculated the comet's trajectory and orbital elements, including its parabolic path and the time of perihelion. Although he did not determine the comet's period or predict its return, his observations and calculations provided valuable data for astronomers of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
