They study two models, one with equally spaced energy levels and another as a perfect gas. The results show that the orthodox theory is not universally valid and that the true distribution law is more complex, with the orthodox expression being valid at high and low temperatures but failing in a range of intermediate temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
