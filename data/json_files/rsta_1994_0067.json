It discusses the use of continuous-time stochastic calculus in constructing and applying these models, particularly for managing interest-rate risk and understanding the process by which interest rates change over time. The article also explores single-factor and infinite-factor models, as well as the calibration and empirical comparisons of these models.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Finance"}
