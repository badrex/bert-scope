They propose that the duration of after-discharge is influenced by the amount or concentration of the exciting state or agent in the central nervous system. The author also explains the role of temporal summation and asynchronism in the central nervous system's response to afferent nerve stimulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
