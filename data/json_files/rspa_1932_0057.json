They used a 35% cobalt steel for the magnet, which reduces the size and weight of the magnet while maintaining its magnetic strength. The magnet's design allows for a field strength of at least 20,000, making it suitable for dealing with high-energy particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
