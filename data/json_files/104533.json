Ellicott explores the role of electric effluvia in these phenomena and proposes that the attraction between electric effluvia and water is responsible for the observed effects. He also explains how the current of electric effluvia influences the behavior of water in these experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
