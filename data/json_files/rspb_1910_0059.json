They discovered that animal cells are negatively electrified, while vegetable cells are positively electrified. The study was conducted using a high voltage and resistance, observing the movement of cells in an electric field. This research provides insights into the electrical characteristics of living cells and their colloidal components.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Cell Biology"}
