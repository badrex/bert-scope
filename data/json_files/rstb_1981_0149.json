The author presents evidence from single case studies, showing that word frequency is a significant determinant of performance, and that comprehension deficits can be category-specific, overriding the effects of task difficulty. The hierarchical organization of semantic representations of single words and the vulnerability of subordinate information compared to superordinate information are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
