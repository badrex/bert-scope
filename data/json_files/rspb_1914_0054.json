It highlights the findings that castration causes a persistent growth and a retarded atrophy of the gland in rabbits and cattle. The reciprocal action of the thymus on the testis is also investigated in guinea pigs, showing that thymectomy leads to a more rapid growth of the testes in young animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
