The authors describe the various zones, including the maritime zone, littoral fringe, eulittoral zone, sublittoral fringe, and sublittoral zone. They also discuss the effects of wave exposure, topography, and shelter on the intertidal zonation patterns. The research provides insights into the distribution of mollusks and other organisms in the intertidal areas of the Solomon Islands.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
