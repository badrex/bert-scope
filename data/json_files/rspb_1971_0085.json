This theory considers reactive forces between the fish and water, taking into account the inertia of associated water movements. The author applies this theory to fish with slender caudal fins, providing a better understanding of their propulsion and efficiency in swimming.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Ichthyology"}
