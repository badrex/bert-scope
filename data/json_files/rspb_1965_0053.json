Mice bred for multiple generations in a cold environment showed improved fitness in the cold, with differences in body weight, organ weights, and body composition compared to mice kept at a warmer temperature. The results suggest that cold adaptation may be due to intracellular changes making individual tissues more efficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Environmental and Earth Sciences"}
