It discusses the freezing points of various alloys and their effects on the standardization of coinage. The author concludes that using silver as the alloying metal in the manufacture of trial plates is preferable for maintaining uniformity and accuracy in the assay of standard bars and coins.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
