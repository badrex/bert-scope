The results show that lesions in specific areas, such as the medial preoptic area, can lead to changes in reproductive function, including ovulation blockage in females and hyperactivity in the pituitary-testis system in males.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroendocrinology"}
