They found that the coefficient of expansion of ice is nearly twice as great as the coefficient of dilatation of lead, and more than twice as great as that of any other solid. The author also explained the formation of transverse and lateral crevasses in glaciers and the fact that a glacier crushes itself through a gorge. These findings contribute to our understanding of the mechanics of glacier motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
