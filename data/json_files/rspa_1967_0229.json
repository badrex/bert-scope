They analyze the critical size of an individual grain in a polycrystalline material using two models: one where internal demagnetizing effects arise at non-magnetic gaps at grain boundaries, and another where grains are misoriented from the common easy axis. The study concludes that the latter model is more satisfactory in explaining observed domain structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
