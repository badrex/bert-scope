The HLA system is a complex gene cluster with multiple loci that play a crucial role in immune responses and transplantation matching. The article reviews the basic genetics of the HLA system, introduces the recently defined la antigens, and explores the application of somatic cell genetics to analyze the HLA system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
