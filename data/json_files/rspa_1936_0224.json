They introduce the spin interaction and the effect of retardation in the calculations and apply the method to evaluate the separations of the components of the helium term. The study provides a deeper understanding of the interaction energy of two electrons and its implications in atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
