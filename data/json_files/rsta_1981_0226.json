The author concludes that magnetic fields pervade the entire interstellar medium, including low and high-density gas clouds. Magnetic fields play a significant role in astrophysical phenomena, such as gravitational collapse of clouds and star formation. The study also indicates that the magnetic field direction is preserved during cloud collapse.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
