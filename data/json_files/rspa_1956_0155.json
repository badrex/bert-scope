The authors interpret data on the hyperfine structure and coupling tensors to understand the charge transfer and probability of magnetic electrons in the crystal lattice. They suggest that fluorine s and p functions are required to explain the observed effects, and discuss the role of orbital interactions and spin-orbit coupling in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
