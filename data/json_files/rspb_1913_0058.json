The study examines the life cycle of the parasite in Glossina morsitans (tsetse fly) and its impact on animal health. The researchers found that the tsetse fly can transmit the disease to animals through its proboscis, and that the salivary glands are not involved in the transmission process. The article provides insights into the different modes of development in trypanosomes and their impact on animal health.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
