It covers the biosynthesis of 6-APA, microbial and chemical processes for its production, and the enzymatic hydrolysis of penicillins to obtain 6-APA. The article highlights the importance of efficient fermentation conditions and the role of enzymes in deacylation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry and Biotechnology"}
