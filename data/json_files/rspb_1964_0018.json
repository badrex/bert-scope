These proteins help differentiate between species and individuals. The distribution of Y and Z proteins is determined by allelic genes, and there is no correlation with sex or geographical origin. The proteins are absent in foetal erythrocytes but appear during infancy alongside adult haemoglobin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
