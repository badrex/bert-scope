They found that walking at a moderate pace for a considerable amount of time led to changes in the respiratory quotient and the appearance of lactic acid in the blood. These changes were more noticeable during the period of rest after the exercise. The study aimed to understand the metabolic changes involved in moderate exercise and how they affect the body's energy stores and utilization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Exercise Physiology"}
