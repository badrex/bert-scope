He discovered that these non-conductive solids could be made to generate a continuous voltaic current when placed in a gas battery. This allowed for the study of their electrochemical relations and introduced the use of the galvanometer as a test of vaporization. Grove also described a new form of gas battery that used a single piece of zinc to generate hydrogen, which charged an indefinite number of cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
