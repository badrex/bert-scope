The researchers found that the evaporation rate increases with higher temperatures and lower air pressure. They also discovered that the diffusion coefficient in air for di-n-butyl phthalate is 76 cm\u00b2/s, and the evaporation coefficient is unity at temperatures between 15 to 60\u00b0C. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the evaporation process and can be applied to other substances and situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
