They discovered that the fish's electricity can magnetize a needle and move it in a spiral wire and a multiplier. The fish's electricity can also pass through air and produce luminous sparks, but it does not affect the common electrometer. The author also found that the fish can act as a chemical agent, evolving gas and affecting solutions of salt and nitrate of silver.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Electrobiology"}
