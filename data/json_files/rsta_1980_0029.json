The study finds that, despite differences in data validation and software, the agreement between various models is generally better than 1 meter. The influence of meteorological parameters and the choice of ephemeris on station coordinates is also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
