The study focuses on the observations and analysis of the bore's arrival time, water levels, and the height of water during the first 40 minutes after the first rise. The author also discusses the challenges faced during the observation process, such as the arrival of nightfall and the difficulty in timing the eager accurately. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of the Trent bore and its impact on the river's dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology"}
