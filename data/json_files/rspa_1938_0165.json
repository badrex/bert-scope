They discuss the separation techniques for lithium and boron isotopes using ion sources, ion lenses, and mass spectrographs. The separation of isotopes simplifies the interpretation of the results and allows for the study of the properties of individual isotopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
