They analyze the properties of the luminal and peritubular cell boundaries, focusing on ionic pump and leak characteristics. The study highlights the role of sodium, potassium, and hydrogen ions in tubular ion exchange processes and the importance of extracellular shunt pathways in the proximal tubular epithelium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology > Nephrology"}
