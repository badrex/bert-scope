They discover that the green, yellow, and red bands in the spectrum are actually a selection of the first positive bands of nitrogen. The author also examines the effect of adding helium to nitrogen and finds that the cyanogen spectrum disappears when a trace of oxygen is introduced, suggesting that hydrocyanic acid is formed in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
