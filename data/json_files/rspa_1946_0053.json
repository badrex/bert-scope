The first theory uses a cubic cell approach, while the second theory considers a spherical shell surrounding a molecule. Both theories show deviations from the law of Guldberg and Waage at high densities, with the second theory providing a more accurate measure of encounters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
