They measured the thermal changes accompanying magnetization and conducted Bitter figure studies to observe domain patterns. The results showed a correlation between the thermomagnetic changes and the appearance of Neel spikes and domains of reverse magnetization. The findings provide insights into the magnetic properties of silicon-iron crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
