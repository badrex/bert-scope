They describe the process of embryonic development, the formation of the cephalic plate, and the growth of the skull and its associated structures. The study provides valuable insights into the comparative anatomy and embryology of fish, particularly in the Vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Embryology"}
