This finding suggests that retinal cells contain different messengers that code for these neurotransmitter receptors. The kainate receptors are involved in the neurotoxic effects produced by kainate in the retina, while glycine receptors are similar to those elicited by glycine in oocytes injected with human or rat brain mRNA.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
