This connection may be similar to the phototransduction process in rods, with cGMP acting as the second messenger, opening ion channels. The findings suggest that the glutamate receptors' activation through G-proteins helps regulate intracellular cGMP levels, which in turn affects the opening of subsynaptic membrane channels in rod bipolar cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
