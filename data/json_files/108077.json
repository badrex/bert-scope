They find that the ova have a unique structure and development process, which may indicate a closer relationship to birds than previously thought. The author also discusses the implications of these findings for understanding the reproductive biology of monotremes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
