The research examines the effects of various variables, such as angular frequency, amplitude, particle diameter, density difference, and liquid viscosity, and compares oscillatory flow results with previous steady flow data. The findings provide insights into the formation of dunes and the enhancement of suspended solids transportation through pipelines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
