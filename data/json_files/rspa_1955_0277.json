The theory is applied to a monatomic face-centred cubic lattice, determining the five microscopic force constants for aluminum. These constants are computed from experimental data on the elastic constants and high-temperature behavior of specific heat and calorimetric entropy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
