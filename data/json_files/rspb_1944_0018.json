They found that egg viability is highest during the third to fifth days and is influenced by the quality of the yeast fed to the adults. The authors also discovered that alterations of fecundity due to diet always accompany similar alterations of egg viability, but egg viability is more sensitive to nutritional differences than fecundity. They concluded that under uniform conditions, the upper limit of egg viability is probably under genetic control, and individual egg viability differences are due to differences in larval environment and adult nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Population Biology"}
