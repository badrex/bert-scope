Light stimuli, such as yellow and blue wavelengths, play a significant role in determining green and brown pupal colours. Other factors, like relative humidity and substrate texture, also affect pupal colour but are less important than light stimuli. The results are relevant to the time of day when larvae choose pupation sites and the ecology of the species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
