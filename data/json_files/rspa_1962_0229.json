The authors describe the compounds in terms of localized molecular-orbital bonds and link the definitions of covalency and polarity with the net ionicity of the atoms in the crystal. They provide non-empirical calculations for boron nitride and present a semi-empirical analysis for estimating the coefficients in the molecular-orbital description. The charges predicted by these methods agree well with experimental values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
