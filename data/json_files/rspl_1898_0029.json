The calorimeter consists of a wooden chamber lined with cotton wool, with a copper chamber inside. The heat emitted by the person is absorbed by the ice, which melts and turns into water. The water is then measured to determine the amount of heat emitted by the person. This calorimeter allows for more accurate measurements of human body heat and can be used for various experiments and studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
