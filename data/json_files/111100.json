He discovered spiral structures in several nebulae, such as 51 Messier, and suggests that these nebulae are systems of a similar nature, seen from different angles. The author also discusses the challenges of measuring these objects and hopes that other astronomers will study them further.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
