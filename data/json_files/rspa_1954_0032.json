The authors analyzed 417 tracks of cr-mesons and found no disintegrations that can be attributed to heavy mesons. The results suggest that some negative heavy mesons may behave differently from negative mu particles when brought to rest in photographic emulsions. Possible explanations for this result are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
