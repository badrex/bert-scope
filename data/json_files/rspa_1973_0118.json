The researchers measured these structures again, mainly in the course of measurements of the isotope shifts in this spectrum. They used an improved experimental method and analyzed enriched isotopes to provide revised and new values of hyperfine structures and hyperfine structure constants for the levels of xenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
