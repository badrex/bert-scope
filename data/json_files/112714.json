They discovered a new type of spark called the \"flaming spark,\" which is thick and flame-like in appearance. The author also found that the spark could produce nitric acid and that the popular notion of nitric acid production during thunderstorms might be correct. Additionally, they observed the effect of a cooling surface on the spark and the differences in sparks when using different materials and setups.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
