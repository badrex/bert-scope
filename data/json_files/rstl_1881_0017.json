The author aims to make the subject more accessible by reorganizing parts, separating essential steps, and introducing a symbol and theorem discussed by Boole. The article also explores applications of Abel's theorem in the comparison of transcendental functions and the summation of integrals.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mathematical Analysis"}
