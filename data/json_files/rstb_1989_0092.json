It highlights the importance of understanding the nature of paraphyletic groups and their role in the extinction events. The author also examines the problems associated with stratigraphy, correlation, and provincialism in the early Palaeozoic era.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
