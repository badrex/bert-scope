Samuel Haughton to study the law of fatigue and its application to animal mechanics, specifically focusing on shoulder muscles. Haughton found that the total work done by the muscles before fatigue is proportional to the weight held and the time of the experiment. The results of these experiments support the application of the law of fatigue in understanding muscle function and fatigue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
