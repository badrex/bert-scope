The authors report on experiments that observed these effects and present a theoretical framework for understanding them. Second-order effects arise from tensorial nonlinearity in the constitutive equations and can be separated from first-order deformation. The study of these effects helps improve our understanding of materials' behavior under stress and strain.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
