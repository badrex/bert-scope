The authors calculate the probabilities of different types of coincidences caused by primary electrons and discuss the number of shower electrons below a critical energy. They also examine the fluctuations of the average numbers of fast and slow electrons and positrons in showers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
