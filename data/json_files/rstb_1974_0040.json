The researchers found that no motoneurons showed inherent rhythmicity, and no direct pathways between motoneurons were observed. Instead, interneurons providing various rhythmic, excitatory, and inhibitory synaptic inputs to the motoneurons are inferred to produce the ventilatory rhythm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
