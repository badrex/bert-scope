They observe that the red blood cells behave as ellipsoids under internal pressure and can withstand a certain amount of distension before the capsule gives way. The study provides insights into the mode of action of hemolytic substances and their effects on the red blood cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
