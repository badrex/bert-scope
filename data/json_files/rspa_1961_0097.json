They found that the phosphorus particles remain suspended in the gas phase for several minutes, and the excited P2 is produced in a vibrationally excited state. The secondary reactions following photolysis are homogeneous, and a mechanism for the photolysis and production of excited P2 is proposed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
