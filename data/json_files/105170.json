The first method expresses the ratio of segments of a line cut in extreme and mean proportion using rational numbers. The second method presents a series of rational fractions that converge to the square root of any number proposed. The author also provides examples and explains how to form these series.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
