The author also examines the effect of magnetic fields on the resistivity of bismuth and finds that the effect of a given transverse magnetic field in increasing the resistivity of bismuth is immensely increased when cooled to the temperature of liquid air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
