They propose that fiber growth is random and follow statistical laws, allowing them to calculate the average number of connections between axonal and dendritic systems. This research applies to neural bodies, including the cerebral cortex, where no specific arrangement of fibers can be found.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
