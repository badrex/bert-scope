They analyze the damage using simplified postulates based on impact dynamics and fracture mechanics concepts, identifying primary material and target parameters affecting impact fracture. The findings have implications for strength degradation and erosion in brittle materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
