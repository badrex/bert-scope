They used a double-diaphragm detonating driver tube to obtain accurate temperature measurements and corrected for self-absorption in the stronger red lines. The results can be used to determine temperatures in argon in the range of 6000 to 12000 K from the ratio of line intensities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
