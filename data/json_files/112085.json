They describe its structure, growth patterns, and the process of siliceous infiltration, which preserved the organism's soft body and pseudopodial extensions. Eozoon Canadense is found to be a type of Foraminifera, a group of single-celled organisms with a unique structure and growth patterns. This discovery sheds light on the importance of the Rhizopod type in early geological history and the evolution of life."}
