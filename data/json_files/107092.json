The tusk's ivory texture showed no external injury, and the spearhead pointed towards the tusk's apex. The presence of the spearhead likely caused inflammation and suppuration. The discovery provides insight into the anatomy of elephants and the potential injuries they may suffer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
