By analyzing historical magnetic measurements, the authors construct field models to map the core-mantle boundary and determine the fluid flow within the Earth's core. They find evidence of drifting features, static field concentrations, and the influence of core-mantle interactions on the geomagnetic field. While the steady flow hypothesis is not strongly contradicted, the authors question the validity of the flow maps derived from the data.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
