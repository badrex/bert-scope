They found that the medicine acts through the medium of the circulation and not directly on the stomach and intestines. The study showed that the infusion of colchicum can be received into the circulation without causing permanent harm and that it helps in reducing the frequency of the pulse, which indicates its beneficial effects on gout.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pharmacology and Drug Treatment"}
