Evidence of different crystalline sites was observed in both cases, and the experimental data were treated using a x2 test. The results showed that the irradiation led to new crystalline sites and changes in the first asymmetry parameter, while the fundamental interaction frequency and frequency distribution remained within the limit of error."}
