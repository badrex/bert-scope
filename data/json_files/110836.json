He found that certain fish species have higher body temperatures than their surrounding environment, and their blood's unique structure may contribute to this. Additionally, Davy discovered that elderly people's body temperatures are slightly higher than those of middle-aged individuals, possibly due to the way their bodies process food for respiration. Lastly, he studied the effect of moderate exercise on body temperature and found that it primarily affects the extremities rather than the central and deep-seated parts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
