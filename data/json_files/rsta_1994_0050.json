The authors focus on predicting and manipulating cross-well chaos in the system. They develop a method to determine parameter conditions for homoclinic tangles and explore the effects of higher harmonics on the range of excitation amplitudes. The study also relates the rate of cross-well excursions to the rate of phase space flux in a Poincar\u00e9 map, providing insights into how various system and input parameters influence chaotic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
