They found that the expansion rates varied significantly depending on the purity of the metals and the molecular state of the materials. The study highlights the importance of using pure metals for accurate expansion measurements and demonstrates the influence of molecular state on thermal expansion and conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
