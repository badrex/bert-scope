The hailstones were unusually large and heavy, with one weighing almost 8 pounds. The storm's intensity was compared to the discharge of a hundred cannons at once. The church's south-east corner suffered the most damage, with stones from the church pinnacle scattered in all directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
