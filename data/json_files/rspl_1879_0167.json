They found that this group was likely the spectrum of water, and further investigated the spectrum of the oxyhydrogen flame. The author also observed additional lines in the spectrum when coal-gas was used instead of hydrogen, suggesting the presence of carbon compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
