The operation involved 270 men, 80 feet of shores, and nine pairs of bed-screws to lift the ship's head. The author also calculated the ship's weight, which was 1576 tons, and discussed the challenges and methods used in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Shipbuilding"}
