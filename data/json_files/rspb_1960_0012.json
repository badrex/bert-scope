They find that glucose uptake is dependent on adenosine triphosphate and occurs on the outside of the plasma membrane. The primary absorption mechanism is a hexokinase system linked with a system that regenerates adenosine triphosphate. The study also shows that light has a stimulating effect on glucose uptake, providing more energy-rich phosphates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
