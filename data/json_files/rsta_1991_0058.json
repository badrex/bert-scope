The authors consider the effects of viscosity and nonlinearity on the gas dynamic field, especially for large mass fluxes, and find that these effects can be very striking. The study provides a better understanding of the phenomena of evaporation and condensation and has implications for future experimental investigations of the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
