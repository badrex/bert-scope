They found that compounds with a carboxylamide group in the 6 position were therapeutically active, and the anil analogues were slightly less effective than the styryl analogues. The study provides insights into the development of new antiseptic and trypanocidal drugs.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
