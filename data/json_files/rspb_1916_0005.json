They found that the offspring of individual sexual females contained either all male-producing or all female-producing individuals, disproving the hypothesis that the difference depended on two kinds of spermatozoa. The author also confirmed that females of the sexual generation do not reproduce parthenogenetically.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
