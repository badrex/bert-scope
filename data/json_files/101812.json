The innovative machine uses a serpent-shaped handle, a shuttle, and a series of arms to automate the weaving process. This design allows for broader cloth production, fewer knots, and faster work with less cost, as it only requires one boy to operate multiple looms.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Textile Engineering"}
