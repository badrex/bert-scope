He discovered that some gases, like nitrogen, are diamagnetic and repel magnetic fields, while others, like oxygen, are magnetic and attract magnetic fields. Faraday also found that gases can expand or contract in a magnetic field, which could help determine their magnetic properties. However, he was unable to observe any changes in the course of a light ray passing near a magnetic pole.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
