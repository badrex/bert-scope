They find that the distribution and arrangement of dye droplets are identical to the Golgi apparatus, suggesting a physiological function for the latter. The study also provides a cytological technique for intra-vitam staining with trypan blue, allowing for the demonstration of both dye droplets and the Golgi apparatus in the same preparation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
