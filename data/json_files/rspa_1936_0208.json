They discover that these wires have a higher AC resistance and self-inductance compared to non-magnetic wires. The AC resistance significantly changes when an external magnetic field is applied, which could have implications for the design and efficiency of electrical devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
