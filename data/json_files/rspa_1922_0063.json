They observe that all fatty acids expand along the surface at a certain temperature, which depends on the substance and the solution's composition. The author also examines the effect of molecular weight and double bonds on the temperature of expansion and the area to which the films expand.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
