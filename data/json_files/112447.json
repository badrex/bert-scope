By enclosing the thermometer bulb in a second glass tube filled with alcohol, the instrument can accurately measure temperature changes without being affected by pressure. This innovation improves deep-sea temperature data accuracy and contributes to better understanding of oceanic conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
