The results show that unilateral castration does not result in hypertrophy of function in the remaining testis; the rate of spermatozoa production remains at approximately half that of the control group. This research contrasts with previous findings in rats, highlighting differences in technique and potential species differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
