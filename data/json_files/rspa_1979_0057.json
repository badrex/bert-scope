Both classes of novae are believed to require a semidetached binary system, with mass transfer via a stellar wind or Roche lobe overflow onto a compact companion. The author reviews present theoretical models for both types of novae, which are based on nuclear burning or accretion energy sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
