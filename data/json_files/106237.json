Despite his inability to see colors, he could still see objects clearly if they were not enveloped in other things. The author, Joseph Huddart, discusses the man's life, his experiences, and his understanding of colors and light. Huddart also shares his observations and experiments with Harris's brother, who also had the same condition, to further understand the nature of color vision deficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision Science"}
