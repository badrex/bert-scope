{"article_id": "111097", "revised_title": "On the Temperature and Pressure of Steam in Expansive Engines", "semantic_tags": ["Thermodynamics", "Steam Engine", "Pressure", "Temperature", "Expansive Engines"], "tldr": "The author, John Curr, continues his research on the temperature and pressure of steam. He discusses the application of his previous findings to the determination of steam pressure when it is insulated from water in the boiler, specifically in the case of expansive engines. Curr argues that the power of expansive engines has been overrated and that Mariotte's law is not fully applicable without limitations. He concludes that his theories, if verified by experiments, can be accepted as absolute truths or as attempts to subvert established laws.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Steam Engine"}
