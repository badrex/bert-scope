They discovered that crustacean muscle fibers have antagonistic nerve fibers carrying excitatory and inhibitory impulses, and that action is often brought about by prolonged facilitation. The research provides insights into the mechanisms of inhibition and facilitation at central synapses in higher animals and the events that mediate between muscle action potential and contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
