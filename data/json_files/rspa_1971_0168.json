The theory focuses on the lower surface flow and assumes that the flow in the central region differs slightly from the corresponding two-dimensional flow over a flat plate. The study provides a better understanding of the aerodynamic forces acting on delta wings, which is essential for designing re-entry vehicles and other aircraft.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
