The author argues that static melting experiments on laser-heated iron in a diamond-anvil cell provide the highest accuracy in melting temperatures. The data suggest a new, unidentified phase for the inner core and an inner-core temperature of about 5000 K. The melting curves of major lower-mantle minerals, such as Mg-Si-perovskite and magnesiow\u00fcstite, are in sharp contrast to previous estimates.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
