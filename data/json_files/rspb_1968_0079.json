They found that rats kept in darkness had larger synaptic profile diameters but lower terminal density compared to those in normal lighting conditions. These changes were reversible and not limited to the visual system, suggesting that light and darkness may have a widespread effect on synaptic structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
