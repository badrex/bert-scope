The author discusses the relationships between these dicynodonts and their adaptations, suggesting that they may have diverged into two main groups based on their snout shape and occiput width. The article also discusses the age and origin of the South American Triassic faunas and the challenges in dating them due to the lack of Middle Triassic vertebrate fossils in the northern hemisphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
