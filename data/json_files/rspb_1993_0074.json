DNA fingerprinting was used to identify extra-pair paternity in chicks, and observations of courtship and mating activities were recorded. The results show that females who failed to successfully breed had more extra-pair copulations, suggesting that females solicit these copulations to enhance the genetic quality of their offspring. This supports the hypothesis that females choose better males for mating, leading to better reproductive success.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
