He investigated the nature of metals from fixed alkalies and earths, and compared the antiphlogistic doctrine with a modified phlogistic hypothesis. Davy also studied the properties of tellurium and its alloys with potassium, as well as the formation of nitrogen and nitric acid from pure water. His findings challenged the existing theories of his time and contributed to the understanding of chemical reactions and the composition of substances."}
