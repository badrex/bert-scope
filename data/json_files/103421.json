He discovers that fish muscles are composed of numerous small vessels that run through and surround the fibers, providing nourishment and connecting the muscles to bones. This discovery challenges the idea that fish muscles lack tendons and contributes to a better understanding of fish anatomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
