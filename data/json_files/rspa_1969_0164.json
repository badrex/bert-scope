They found that these materials exhibit n-type behavior as metallic conductors, with carbon-hexagon networks acting as macro-anions. The temperature coefficient of electrical resistance was measured for these materials, providing insights into their electronic properties and confirming their metallic conductor nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
