The author discusses various aspects of Thom's theories, including the use of the megalithic yard, cup-and-ring carvings, and the alignment of standing stones with celestial bodies. The author also presents several tests to evaluate the validity of Thom's theories, including examining the objectivity of alignments, the visibility of horizon marks, and the archaeological dating of the structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Archaeology > Ancient Astronomy"}
