They found that, despite only a small fraction of vapor molecules entering the liquid, all of them reach temperature equilibrium with the surface before re-evaporating into the vapor. The study provides insights into the evaporation process and the energy transfer between vapor molecules and liquid surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
