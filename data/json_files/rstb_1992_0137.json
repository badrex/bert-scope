The authors find that species differences in song are associated with factors like energetic requirements, reproductive effort, and habitat type. They also discuss the role of song in mate attraction and male-male competition in passerine birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ethology and Animal Behavior"}
