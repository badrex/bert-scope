The paper discusses the optimization of the instrument's design, including the best proportions, sectional area, and moment of inertia. The author also addresses the effects of resistance and magnetic fields on the instrument's sensitivity and dead-beat performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Instrumentation"}
