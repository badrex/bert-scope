They use a thermal Green function technique to calculate average and weighted displacement and momentum correlations, which can be related to observable properties like density of states, thermal energies, optical absorption, and neutron scattering. The method treats multiple interactions with a single defect correctly but only approximately handles interference between defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
