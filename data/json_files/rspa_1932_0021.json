The addition of inert gases, such as helium, argon, nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, decreases the reaction rate and quantum efficiency. The authors propose a mechanism involving chain termination by surface reactions and stabilization of energy-rich complexes by ternary collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
