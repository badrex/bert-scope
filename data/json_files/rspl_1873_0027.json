The machine combines two harmonic curves, allowing users to visualize and study the effects of various musical intervals on the ear. The instrument can be adjusted to produce curves for different consonances, such as octaves, diatonic semitones, and commas.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
