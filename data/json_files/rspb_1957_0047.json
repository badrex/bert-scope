They observe that the majority of bacterial cells in the culture undergo adaptation, rather than a few mutant cells. The study provides evidence of adaptive processes preceding growth and shows that the length of the lag phase varies with the culture's previous history. The findings contribute to a better understanding of bacterial behavior and potential applications in microbiology and medicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
