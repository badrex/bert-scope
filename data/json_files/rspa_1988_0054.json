They show that the elastic potential for any strain is a functional of the elastic potential for pure dilatation. This theory is supported by experimental results on foam rubber.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
