They studied aqueous suspensions of the discotic mineral kaolinite and found that the bands formed predominantly perpendicular to the field vector. The phenomenon of band formation depends on field strength, frequency, and application time, and it has potential as a mechanism for concentrating dispersed colloidal particles into regions of high local density.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
