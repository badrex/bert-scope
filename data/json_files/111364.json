He used a thermomultiplier to measure the thermo-electric properties of various metals and found that steel, cast iron, and copper had different thermo-electric positions. Joule also discovered that stretching metals caused a decrease in temperature when the stretching weight was applied and an increase in temperature when the weight was removed. This confirmed Professor Thomson's theoretical investigations. Joule also observed a reverse action in vulcanized indiarubber, which became heated when stretched and cooled when the weight was removed, and confirmed Thomson's predictions with further experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
