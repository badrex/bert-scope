The study found that female lions with cubs can distinguish between the roars of their own resident males and unfamiliar, potentially infanticidal males. This ability helps them detect and categorize unfamiliar intruders within their territory, protecting their cubs from infanticidal males and expelling intruding females.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
