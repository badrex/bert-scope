The authors analyze the behavior of the absorption coefficient for incipient degeneracy and provide mathematical expressions and tabulated values for various parameters. The study is relevant to astrophysical applications, particularly in understanding stellar configurations with degenerate-gas cores.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
