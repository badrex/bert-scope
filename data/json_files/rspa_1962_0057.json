They find that the kinetics for the former mode of precipitation can be explained by an exponential decrease in the fraction of solute remaining in free solution. The continuous rod-like mode of precipitation is a consequence of a high binding energy in the dislocation core, leading to transient variations in the transfer velocity across the matrix-core interface. This situation closely resembles the experimentally determined strain ageing kinetics in some low-carbon and nitrogen steels.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Solid State Physics"}
