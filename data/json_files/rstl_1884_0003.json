The authors found that the solubility of sodium sulfate increases with temperature, and they also explored the effects of pressure and the relation between solubility and fusibility. They developed a new apparatus to conduct these experiments, which allowed them to study the solubility of various salts at different temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
