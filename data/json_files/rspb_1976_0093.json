The toxin affects neuromuscular transmission by abolishing the release of acetylcholine and disrupting the structure of the neuromuscular junction. The research provides insights into the mode of action of the neurotoxin and its potential impact on the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
