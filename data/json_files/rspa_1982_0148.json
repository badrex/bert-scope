The authors use Rayleigh-Schrodinger perturbation theory to analyze restricted two- and three-body systems. They demonstrate the procedure by applying it to a hydrogen atom perturbed by stationary point charges, providing results for the ground and some excited states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
