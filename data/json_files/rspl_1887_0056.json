The authors used a unique experimental setup to measure the temperature changes in the liquids and calculated their conductivity. The results show that the conductivity depends on the product of the density and specific heat of the liquid. The study also highlights the distinction between heat and electrical conductivity in liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
