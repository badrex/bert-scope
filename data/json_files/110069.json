He found that different gases were acted upon with varying ease, with hydrogen and carbonic oxide being the most reactive. The author also discovered that by regulating the proportion of hydrogen, it was possible to convert all the carbonic oxide into carbonic acid without affecting other gases. Additionally, he proposed a method to obtain pure carburetted hydrogen using platinum as a catalyst.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Analysis"}
