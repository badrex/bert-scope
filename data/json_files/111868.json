He found that it is relatively inert, dissolves only a few substances, and has limited solvent power. It also has unique effects on gutta percha and india-rubber, which may have practical applications. Additionally, liquid carbonic acid is a strong insulator of electricity, similar to bisulphide of carbon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Compounds and Reactions"}
