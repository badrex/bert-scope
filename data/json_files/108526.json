He discovers three main products of decomposition: rubianic acid, rubidehydran, and rubihydran. Schunck also discusses the process of extracting these products from rubian and other natural sources, such as madder. Additionally, he mentions the absorption of oxygen during the decomposition process and the possible formation of acetic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
