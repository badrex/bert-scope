They found that the blood volume can be better expressed as a function of the body surface area rather than as a percentage of body weight. This formula holds true for different species of mammals, indicating that lighter animals with a larger body surface have a relatively greater blood volume.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
