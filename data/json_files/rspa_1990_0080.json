They evaluate this current for axisymmetric, polar perturbations with harmonic time dependence of axisymmetric, static space-times and show that it reproduces the current found by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari. This demonstrates the existence of a suitable flux conservation law for coupled gravitational and matter perturbations in the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
