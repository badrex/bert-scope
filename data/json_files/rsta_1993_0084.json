The authors use a multidisciplinary approach to analyze the spatial distribution of fluid and reservoir parameters, revealing that hydrodynamics provides the key to understanding observed deviations from typical correlations with depth. The study focuses on the Dogger reservoir, which is the main target for oil and geothermal exploitation in the Paris Basin. The authors find that the reservoir is heterogeneous, and the main characteristics can be coupled, leading to the existence of confined and mixing areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Hydrogeology"}
