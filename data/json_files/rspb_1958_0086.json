The results show that after the removal of the vertical lobes, octopuses have a reduced accuracy in visual discrimination. However, slow relearning is possible even after complete removal, and the accuracy of response is proportional to the amount of vertical lobe tissue remaining. The vertical lobe may provide sufficient units to make the information stores strong enough to ensure correct performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
