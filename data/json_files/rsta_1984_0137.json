The modified Robertson projection-operator technique is used, which considers special initial conditions of uncorrelated and permutationally symmetric atoms. The derived equations provide a connection between the density operators and expectation values, allowing for the study of multi-atom correlations and the behavior of large atomic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
