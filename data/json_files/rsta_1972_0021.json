The authors conducted an experimental investigation using 26 Skua II rockets and found a significant correlation between air mass flow and radio-wave absorption in the D-region. The results provide insights into the atmospheric circulation and the transport of minor constituents in the D-region, which can help explain the winter anomaly of radio-wave absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
