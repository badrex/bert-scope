They analyzed core samples and seismic data to understand the region's evolution during the Flandrian transgression and the last glaciation. The study revealed three distinct units of Quaternary deposits, including Flandrian sediments, freshwater postglacial deposits, and basal gravels and pebbles on the bedrock. The research also discussed the palaeovalley's morphology, erosion levels, and the influence of the Flandrian transgression on the gravels and pebbles in the fluvial basin of the Seine.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
