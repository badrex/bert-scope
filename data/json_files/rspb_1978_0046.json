They discovered two paramagnetic centers in the a and \u03b2 chains, which change upon warming above 77 K. The study provides insights into the stability of oxyhaemoglobin and the formation of paramagnetic centers under radiation exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
