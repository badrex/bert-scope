They discovered that the damping factor is affected by the self-induction and the introduction of iron wire cores. The results showed that hysteresis loss is negligible compared to eddy-current loss, and the permeability of iron remains similar at high frequencies as under steady magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
