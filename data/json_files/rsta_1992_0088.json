Pulsar timing observations have confirmed the existence of quadrupolar gravitational waves and provided constraints on the nature of gravity, Newton's constant, and low-frequency gravitational waves in the universe. These findings have significant implications for our understanding of the cosmos and the fundamental forces at play.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
