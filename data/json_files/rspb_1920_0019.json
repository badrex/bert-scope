These tools are different from previously known Paleolithic implements and cannot be assigned to any Neolithic type. The author examines the specimens' characteristics, their geological context, and their possible origins, suggesting that they may have remained undisturbed on the land surface or embedded superficially for long ages after their creation.", "scientific_discipline": "Archaeology > Paleolithic tools"}
