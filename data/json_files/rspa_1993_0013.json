They discuss the effects of internal multiple noise and the signal-to-noise ratio, setting a fundamental limit to the seismic reflection method. The study also explores the use of seismic 'windows' and the importance of low-frequency cutoff limits in detecting target reflections.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
