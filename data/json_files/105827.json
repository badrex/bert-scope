They found that fish have a complex lymphatic system, similar to that of birds and quadrupeds, without lymphatic glands and without valves in the vessels. The lymphatic system in fish plays a crucial role in their physiology and anatomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
