The authors found that different characters can be separately adjusted by selection in their responses to environmental change, and that sensitivity to environmental change is adjustable separately from mean expression of the character. The study highlights the importance of understanding genotype-environment interactions for plant and animal adaptation to varying environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
