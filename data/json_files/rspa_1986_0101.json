They develop constitutive relations for single crystals with rate-dependent crystallographic slip and elastic lattice distortion. The method includes both the Hill and the Kroner-Budiansky-Wu methods as limiting cases and is valid for rate-dependent materials at finite strains and rotations. Illustrative numerical examples show that rate-dependent crystallographic slip produces a more stable overall behavior of polycrystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
