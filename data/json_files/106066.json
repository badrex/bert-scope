They tested the magnetic properties of the needles and their ability to adjust and balance. The experiments were performed to improve the accuracy of navigation and to help determine the longitude. The authors found that the dipping needles could be adjusted with great precision, and they provided a detailed description of the instruments and their setup.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
