He demonstrates a general proposition relating the segments of the generant circle to the corresponding segments of the epicycloid. The author also discusses the quadrature of the interior and exterior epicycloids and their relation to other mathematical concepts.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
