Halley, investigates the thickness of gold on gilt-wire and the minuteness of gold atoms. By examining the specific gravities of gold and silver, he determines that the thickness of the gold layer is extremely thin, containing billions of atoms. This study provides insight into the atomic structure of gold and challenges the prevailing atomic theories of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Theory"}
