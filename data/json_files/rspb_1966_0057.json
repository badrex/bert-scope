This method allowed for the study of the organism and its effects on mice, providing a better understanding of the disease and its transmission. The findings could help in developing treatments and preventive measures for Tyzzer's disease in laboratory mice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
