The researchers found that the ingrowth of serotonergic axons plays a critical role in the maturation of locomotor bursts by transforming the output of embryonic amphibian swimming circuitry into a more mature and flexible form. The study also demonstrates that exposure to a monoamine neurotoxin (5,7 dihydroxytryptamine) deletes serotonergic raphespinal projections and prevents the normal maturation of larval swimming.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
