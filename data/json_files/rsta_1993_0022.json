DLC films are grown under ion bombardment and have properties similar to diamond, making them suitable for protective coatings and anti-reflection coatings on materials like germanium. The article also explores the development of GeC, a durable coating material that can be used in multilayer structures with DLC.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
