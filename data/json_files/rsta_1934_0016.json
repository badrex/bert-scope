They used a modified Fabry-Perot method to compare the lengths of three etalons in air and vacuum, and also determined the refractive index of air. The results agreed with previous measurements within a range of four parts in ten million, and suggested the possibility of defining units of length in terms of the wave-length of visible light instead of material standard bars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
