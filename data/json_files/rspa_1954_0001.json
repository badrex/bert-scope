The author considers the heat transfer between the gas and solid, taking into account the conductivity of the solid and the gas velocity. The study provides a foundation for understanding and designing heat exchangers and cooling systems, such as'sweat cooling' used in gas turbines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
