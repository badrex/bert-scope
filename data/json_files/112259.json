Hofmann, discovered a new compound called paraniline, which has the same chemical composition as aniline but different properties. Paraniline forms a series of crystallized salts and can fix either one or two equivalents of acid. The author also discusses the potential for further research into similar compounds related to other ammonias.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
