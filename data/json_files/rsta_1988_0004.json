The authors used tunable far-infrared laser spectroscopy to measure the rotational factors of molecular ions and determine their dipole moments. The method provides a direct experimental route to a previously unavailable quantity for molecular ions, with potential for precision of about 0.1 in future measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
