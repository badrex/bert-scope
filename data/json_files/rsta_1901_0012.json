The authors use a solvent dissolution method to determine the differences in heat between various alloys and free metals. They find that mixtures of solutions of ferric chloride and ammonium chloride, and of cupric chloride and ammonium chloride, are suitable solvents for this purpose. The study provides important insights into the thermo-chemistry of inter-metallic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
