The condenser and air-pump are made entirely of glass, making them more suitable for precise experiments and easier to clean. The author also explains the process of creating the flat joints, which allow for better sealing and easier disassembly. This innovation could improve the accuracy and efficiency of chemical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Glass engineering"}
