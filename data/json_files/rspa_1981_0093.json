The complexes have the same trimesic acid framework, consisting of two mutually-perpendicular infinite hexagonal planar networks of hydrogen-bonded trimesic acid molecules. The arrangement leaves channels of square cross-section containing linear polyhalide ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
