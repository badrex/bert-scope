They determined several small terms in the spin-Hamiltonian and confirmed the second-order calculation's consistency. The high precision of endor measurements allowed them to estimate the energy of the state of the lowest manifold and the electric quadrupole interaction in the free ion. However, they were unable to measure the hyperfine structure anomaly due to its small size and the limitations of their precision.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
