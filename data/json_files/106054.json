He experimented with using elderberry to protect plants from caterpillars, blights, and crop-destroying flies. Gullet found that elderberry could be used to preserve crops of cabbage, wheat, and turnips from damage. He also suggested that elderberry could be used to protect fruit trees from insects in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture"}
