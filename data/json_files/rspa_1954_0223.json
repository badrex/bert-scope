Notable articles discuss acoustic streaming in liquids, the dynamic lateral instability of beams, and the fine structure of the line 4686 A of singly ionized helium. These studies contribute to a deeper understanding of physical sciences and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
