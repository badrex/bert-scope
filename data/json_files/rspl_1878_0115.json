The author assumes the media to be non-conductors and isotropic as regards magnetic inductive capacity. The study provides expressions for the amplitudes of the reflected and refracted rays and deduces that when the magnetization is all in the direction of the incident plane polarized ray, no effect is produced by it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
