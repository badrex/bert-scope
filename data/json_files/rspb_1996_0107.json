They find that the optimal level of virulence is independent of propagule longevity when the host-parasite system has reached equilibrium. However, for pathogens that have recently invaded a susceptible host population, greater propagule longevity may initially favor higher virulence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
