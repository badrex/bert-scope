They find that nuclear-electronic coupling causes a change in potential energy proportional to the kinetic energy of the electrons. The authors provide accurate asymptotic expressions for the energy states of diatomic molecules and discuss the effect of coupling on the potential energy at large nuclear separations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
