The authors explore two pathways for the initial bond-forming step in the reaction and examine the formation of the two vinyl groups of haem from the propionate residues of the precursor, coproporphyrinogen III. They also study the mechanism of porphyrinogen carboxy-lyase reaction and the action of ALA synthetase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
