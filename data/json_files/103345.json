The inscription provides evidence of the presence of the second Roman Legion called Augusta in Britain. Reverend Dr. John Harris offers conjectures on the inscription, suggesting that the term \"Lugduni\" might refer to a town or hill near the River Lugg, and that the place called Luckton in Herefordshire could be the site of the victory mentioned in the inscription.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeology"}
