They found that the enzyme in Phaseolus lunatus seeds hydrolyzes a-glucosides, contrary to previous beliefs that it hydrolyzed b-glucosides. This research helps to clarify the understanding of enzyme action and the differences between various enzymes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
