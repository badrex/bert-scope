The experiments reveal that the pale cocoons of G. groenlandica accelerate pupal development, while the dark cocoon of G. rossii does not have a detectable effect. The warming effect of sunlight is the main factor influencing the enhanced development in G. groenlandica. The results provide evidence that cocoons can enhance a fitness correlate in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
