He observed that trees exposed to wind grow more vigorously and have a different growth pattern compared to those in sheltered situations. The study also suggests that stripping off the bark can improve tree health. Knight's findings contribute to our understanding of how trees grow and adapt to their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
