They discover that the energy released in the quenching process has a stronger propensity to appear as vibration in the quencher than expected on a purely statistical basis. The results show that the quenching process has a common linear surprise plot for both singlet molecular oxygen and oxygen, indicating that the energy transfer is similar in both cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
