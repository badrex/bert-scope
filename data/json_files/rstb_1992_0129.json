The predominant tonoplast channel is cation selective and has an open-channel conductance of 120 pS in 100 mM KC1. The plasma membrane channel is highly selective for K+ over anions and other cations, showing strong outward rectification. These channels play a role in mediating potassium efflux and elevation of cytoplasmic calcium during the uptake of metabolic substrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular and Molecular Physiology"}
