The author uses a prism to analyze the light from various nebulae, discovering that their spectra consist of three distinct lines. This research challenges the idea that all nebulae are clusters of stars and suggests that they are composed of luminous gas or vapor.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
