They find that the major head protein P23 undergoes cleavage, which leads to a structural rearrangement of the surface lattice. This process is essential for the maturation of the bacteriophage head, and the authors provide evidence that it is controlled by genes 21 and 24.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
