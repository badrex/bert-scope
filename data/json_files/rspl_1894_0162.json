They identified this spectrum as belonging to argon, confirming its presence under these conditions. This discovery also revealed a new method for separating argon from nitrogen by passing an electric discharge through it in the presence of hydrogen, moisture, and acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
