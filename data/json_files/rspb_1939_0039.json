The research shows that these viruses have unique properties, such as increased vector efficiency after fasting before feeding on infected plants, and declining vector efficiency with longer feeding times on the source of infection. This suggests that non-persistent virus transmission is a complex and specialized process, rather than a simple mechanical contamination of the insect's stylets.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
