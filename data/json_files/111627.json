The new material becomes organized and persists as a permanent structure when extension is made. This process is explained, and the appearances presented by the tendon in various stages of reunion are detailed and illustrated by colored drawings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
