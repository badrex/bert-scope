The authors identify the directions of dislocation Burgers vectors and confirm that they lie along specific crystallographic planes. They also demonstrate a one-to-one correspondence between dislocation etch pits and dislocation outerops, showing that transmission X-ray topography can provide clear images of dislocation configurations in thick metal specimens.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
