He noted that the comet's brightness lasted only three days before decaying, but its size continued to increase until it disappeared. Estancel also discussed the limitations of his observations due to the short duration of the comet and the challenges of observing it near the horizon.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
