They find that chromatophores from cells grown at low to moderate light intensity have a constant composition, while those from cells grown at high light intensity or in the dark are heavily contaminated with other cellular structures. This study helps to understand the regulation of pigment content in response to different environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
