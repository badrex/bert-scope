They study the effect of strain on plane groups of molecules and determine the force constants of the bonds. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of molecules under strain and the molecular structure of boron trichloride.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Structure and Spectroscopy"}
