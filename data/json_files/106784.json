The substance had no taste or smell, melted at low heat, and burned at a higher temperature. Sneyd speculated that the bird underwent this change while buried in the mud and was washed up by a nearby brook. The case bears a resemblance to the transformation of human bodies observed by M. Foucault in the Cemetery des Innocents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Biology"}
