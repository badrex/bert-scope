They used a cat as their subject and measured the time taken for the reflex response to travel through the spinal cord. The results showed that the shortest latent period was 10.4 seconds, and the fastest velocity of propagation was 32.4 meters per second. This research helped to understand the nature and duration of the latent period of the flexor reflex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
