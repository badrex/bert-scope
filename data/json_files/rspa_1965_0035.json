This effect can lead to large nuclear polarization and has been observed in metallic sodium, lithium, silicon, and many paramagnetic solutions. The Overhauser effect can be used to enhance nuclear signals and provide detailed information on nuclear relaxation mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
