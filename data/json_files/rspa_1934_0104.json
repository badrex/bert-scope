They compare and supersede existing methods with a titration in 90% acetone solution to successive end-points at pH 3.4 and 4.0 using p-benzenesulphonic acid-azo-a-naphthylamine as an indicator. This method is more accurate and simpler than previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
