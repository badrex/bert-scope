Instead of using a conic to represent the metacentric involute, Rankine suggests using the involute of the involute of a circle. This simplification allows for a more accurate calculation of a ship's moment of stability at any given angle of inclination.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
