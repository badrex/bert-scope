They discovered three distinct modes of flow and found that the contraction coefficient of the flow through the orifice was unity for small amplitudes. The findings have implications for understanding exhaust phenomena in internal combustion engines, particularly those working on the two-stroke cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
