It explains how Taiwan's complex geology, consisting of Permo-Mesozoic basement and Cainozoic cover strata, was formed through crustal accretion and various tectonic events. The study highlights the role of allochthonous terranes and oceanic material in the accretion process and the impact of the Luzon arc's collision with the Chinese continental margin.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
