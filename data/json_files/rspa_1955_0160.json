The study focuses on an infinite plane porous wall with a constant velocity component normal to the wall. The findings demonstrate how velocity fluctuations affect the skin friction and the kinetic temperature of the wall, providing insights into the behavior of boundary layers under fluctuating conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
