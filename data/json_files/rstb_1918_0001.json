They found that cobra venom primarily affects the peripheral nerve endings, leading to paralysis, and also causes respiratory failure. The authors argue that the central nervous system is not directly affected by cobra venom, and the observed symptoms are due to cardiac and peripheral nervous weakness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
