Oxides with a suitable number of impaired d-electrons exhibited high activity, while those with no unpaired d-electrons or too many had low activity. The results suggest that hydrogen behaves similarly at metal and oxide surfaces, providing a common motif for catalysis by these solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
