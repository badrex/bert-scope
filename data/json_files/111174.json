Powell discusses the limitations of the paper and the potential issues with the wave theory. He concludes that while the new modifications of the phenomena are generally consistent with the undulatory theory, further analytical investigations are needed for a definitive opinion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
