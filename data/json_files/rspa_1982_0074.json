The author derives canonical line elements that admit these tensors and classifies them based on the sign of the scalar. The article also reveals close analogies between the vector field along a geodesic and the angular momentum in the case of spacelike Killing-Yano tensors. The existence of these tensors implies the existence of an analogue of the \"equatorial plane\" of the classical Kepler problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
