They also demonstrate how to generalize this method for Einstein-Maxwell space-times, overcoming previous limitations with the Landau-Lifshitz pseudo-tensor. This work provides a valuable computational tool for understanding the behavior of perturbed space-times in the context of general relativity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
