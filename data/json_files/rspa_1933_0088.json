The authors present an analytical solution for the distribution of doublets along the plate and calculate the drag coefficient. The results are compared with the Prandtl-Blasius theory and experimental observations, showing a close agreement for large Reynolds numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
