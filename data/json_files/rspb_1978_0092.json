The research shows that crypt cells, formed before birth, never become vacuolated, and the main change in cell populations involves cells produced by mitosis. The findings provide insights into understanding how cellular replacement relates to changing intestinal function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
