The authors describe the conversion of radiolabeled penicillin N into deacetoxycephalosporin C and propose a general mechanism for these conversions. The study also examines the possible mechanisms of penicillin and cephalosporin biosynthesis, suggesting that oxygenase activity on small peptides may be responsible for these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
