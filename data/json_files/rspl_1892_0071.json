They argue against the existence of a precoracoid in the Ichthyosaurian shoulder girdle and provide a detailed analysis of the scapula and coracoid bones, concluding that the idea of a tripartite division of the ventral end of the scapula is illusory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
