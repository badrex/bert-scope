The study reveals that the intensity of the light impression plays a significant role in the colors and changes observed in retinal images. The author also explores the practical applications of this research, such as determining the relative degrees of illumination and selecting harmonious colors in art.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
