They found that adhesion to the vessel sides is crucial for maintaining supersaturation, and any interference with this adhesion can cause the solution to break down. The author also tested various coatings on the vessel sides to improve the stability of supersaturated solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Physics"}
