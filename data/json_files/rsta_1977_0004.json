They found that the concentration of hydrolysable carbon species in the samples is associated with metallic iron, and the ratio of involatile to volatile carbon provides information about the thermal history of various particle types. The study also showed that the finer fractions of the samples have lower ratios and higher absolute amounts of hydrolysable carbon.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
