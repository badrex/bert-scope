It discusses the differences in flow behavior between attached and separated turbulent boundary layers and explores the role of large-scale structures in generating turbulence and Reynolds shearing stresses in the outer region of the shear layer. The study also examines the impact of pressure gradients on the flow structure and the importance of understanding detachment and reattachment processes in improving the performance of flow devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
