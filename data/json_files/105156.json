He examines the fossil and concludes that it belongs to the crustaceous tribe of animals, specifically the Pediculus marinus major trilobos. Da Costa also mentions that this species has not been described by any English author, but it was described and figured, albeit poorly, by Mr. Edw. Lhuyd in his Lithophylacium Britannicum Ichnographia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
