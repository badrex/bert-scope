They found that different types of cells, including parenchymal, bile-duct, and sinusoid lining cells, participate in the regeneration process. The study suggests that increased mobility of cells during regeneration may play a crucial role in the regenerative process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
