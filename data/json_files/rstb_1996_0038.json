It highlights how NGF and NT-3 can counteract the changes that occur in sensory neurons after injury, such as alterations in morphology, enzyme expression, and peptide levels. The study focuses on understanding the actions of neurotrophins in nerve injury and repair and the intracellular pathways involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
