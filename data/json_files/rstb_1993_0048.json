The research found that albatrosses and giant petrels used a combination of wave soaring and dynamic soaring in windy conditions, while shearwaters and fulmars proceeded by flap-gliding. The little shearwater flew faster using continuous flapping flight, and south polar skuas and Wilson's storm-petrels were tracked on foraging flights. The findings provide insight into seabirds' capacities for traveling over the open sea and their movements in relation to weather and wind systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
