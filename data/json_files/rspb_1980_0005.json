The research also examines the ultrastructure of enterocytes and their characteristics, such as microvilli length and terminal web width, which help distinguish foetal and adult types of enterocytes. The findings may have implications for understanding the susceptibility of neonatal pigs to enteric diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
