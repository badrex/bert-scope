They provide a general solution for forces acting on the edges of the strip and a specific solution for a force acting at any point within the strip. The solution satisfies the boundary conditions and can be used to calculate stresses and displacements in various scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
