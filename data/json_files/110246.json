Cadell, discusses the hour lines on ancient Greek and Roman sundials and how they correspond to the division of time between sunrise and sunset. He explains that these hour lines, when extended on a sphere, form curves of double curvature and describes the properties of the cones and lines generated by these curves. This paper also mentions the election of the Earl of Selkirk as a Fellow of the Royal Society and the presentation of other scientific works.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeology and History of Technology"}
