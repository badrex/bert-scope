This phenomenon is due to the different ways land and water lose heat, with water cooling the surrounding air as it evaporates. The author provides numerous examples of observations made during his travels, showing how the temperature of the water and air affects mist formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
