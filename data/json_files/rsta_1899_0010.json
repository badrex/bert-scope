They develop a new method for measuring the expansion of interference apparatus using a disc of indium, which allows for more accurate determination of the properties of solid substances, particularly crystals. The study focuses on the isomorphous series of normal sulphates, with a particular emphasis on the thermal expansion of each crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
