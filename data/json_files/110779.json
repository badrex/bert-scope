The results support the hypothesis that currents in the atmosphere are influenced by the variable relations of heating and cooling between the Atlantic Ocean and the European continent. The author also notes that Raymond's observations on the height of Clermont Ferrand corroborate this finding.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
