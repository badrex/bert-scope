The depolarization and reduction of membrane resistance by noradrenaline are directly related to external chloride concentration, while acetylcholine's effects are not chloride-dependent. Sodium is not essential for noradrenaline's stimulant effect, which may involve a more complex mechanism involving calcium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Smooth Muscle Physiology"}
