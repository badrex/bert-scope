They describe experiments with mice and different diseases to study the effects of varying the rate of addition of susceptible mice and the type of contact between infected and uninfected individuals. The author emphasizes the need to consider environmental factors and the complexity of natural systems in order to effectively intervene and control disease outbreaks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Epidemiology"}
