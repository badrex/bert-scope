The study explores multiple stationary states, sustained oscillations, and transient behavior in these equations, providing insights into the complex patterns and responses of chemical reactions in various systems. The findings have implications for understanding and modeling chemical processes in both open and closed systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
