The process involves the reaction of chromium carbene complexes with imines to produce lactams, which can then be cleaved to form natural and unnatural amino acids. This method offers high diastereoselectivity and has potential for future applications in organic synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
