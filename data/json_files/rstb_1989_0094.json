It examines the factors affecting preservation and the challenges in assessing the fossil record's completeness. The study highlights the importance of understanding the incompleteness of the fossil record to improve macroevolutionary studies and test hypotheses related to mass extinctions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobiology"}
