The study finds that peroxidase crosses the endothelial layer by passing through the intercellular junctions and entering caveolae and vesicles. This research helps understand how large molecules, like lipoproteins, accumulate in the arteries in diseases like atherosclerosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
