They found that the neck, shoulders, and chest wall move significantly during breathing. The vertebral column and diaphragm play crucial roles in respiration, with the diaphragm being more powerful on the right side due to the resistance of the liver. The study also highlights the importance of spinal movement in the aeration of the lungs and the support of the diaphragm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
