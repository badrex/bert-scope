The research shows that high potassium concentrations cause fibrillation, while excess calcium and magnesium can lead to abnormal heart contractions and beat irregularities. The findings contribute to understanding the factors that cause heart fibrillation and the role of electrolyte imbalances in cardiac function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
