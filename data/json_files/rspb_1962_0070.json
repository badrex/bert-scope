It explores their biological functions, including their role in insect vision, growth regulation, and their connection to folic acid, a vital nutrient involved in one-carbon transfers and the synthesis of nucleic acids and proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
