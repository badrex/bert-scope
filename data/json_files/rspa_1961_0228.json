They found that intermediate coupling, relativistic, and diamagnetic corrections recently calculated by Judd and Lindgren provide good agreement with the measured values of Nd, Sm, Gd, Dy, and Er. The results support the idea of fairly pure coupling between the electrons and indicate a strong interaction between the ground state and a low-lying state from another configuration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
