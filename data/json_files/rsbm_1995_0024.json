Sawicki's work involved studying the insecticidal activity of natural pyrethrum and conducting bioassays to determine the effectiveness of synergists like piperonyl butoxide. His research played a significant role in the development of new strategies to prevent insecticide resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
