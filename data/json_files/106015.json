The experiments showed that blood and other fluids expand when placed in a vacuum, debunking the idea that an elastic vapor exists in blood vessels. The findings also suggested that animal bodies can withstand greater atmospheric pressure variations than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Circulatory System"}
