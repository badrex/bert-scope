It demonstrates how an arbitrary conformally flat metric can be defined by selecting a scalar field on a four-dimensional quadric hypersurface embedded in projective 5-space. The properties of Friedmann-Robertson-Walker cosmological models are derived as examples within this framework.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Projective Geometry"}
