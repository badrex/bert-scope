The authors conducted experiments using a unique apparatus to measure the pressure and temperature of steam at various points. They found that the rate of expansion of superheated steam decreases as the temperature increases, eventually becoming almost identical with that of air. This research confirms the general law of expansion for superheated steam.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
