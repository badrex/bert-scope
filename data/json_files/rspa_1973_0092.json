The author derives general expressions for the relations between bending moment, torque, longitudinal curvature, and twisting curvature for strips of lenticular and constant section. The behavior of strips under pure moment and pure torque is examined, considering the effects of initial curvatures and the presence of alternative states of deformation due to bifurcational or snap-through instabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
