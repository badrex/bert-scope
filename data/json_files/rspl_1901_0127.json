The granular medium, with close packing and relative motion, accounts for the conservation of energy, the absence of normal waves, and the blackness of the sky on a clear night. This research was initially aimed at understanding the flow of gas in tubes and the thermal transpiration of gases, but it led to a broader explanation of the universe's mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
