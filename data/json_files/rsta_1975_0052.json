The authors discuss the influence of sediment grain size, boundary layer measurements, and regional variations in sediment parameters. They find that tidal currents alone are just competent to move the sediments, while wave-induced oscillatory currents have a more significant impact on sorting. The study suggests that many ancient, extensive, well-sorted sand sheets may have been deposited at depths greater than previously suspected.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Geology"}
