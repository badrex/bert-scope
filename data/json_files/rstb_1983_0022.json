The research focuses on the differentiation, frequency, and distribution of astrocytes, oligodendrocytes, and microglial cells during the development process. The findings contribute to the understanding of the role of glial cells in the maturation of the visual cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
