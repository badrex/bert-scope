The error was discovered by Captain Kater and involved the value of a division of the long level of the repeating circle used in the observations. The author, Henry Foster, made necessary recomputations and submitted the corrected tables to the Royal Society. The error arose from incorrect information about the instrument. The affected tables are the 7th, 8th, 9th, 10th, 11th, and 12th, with corrections not exceeding 6\"1 in the first three and 2\" in the latter three.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
