They propose that the polar transport of auxin, which involves channels or pumps in cells, can lead to the formation of discrete veins. The study suggests that the efficiency of auxin transport increases with the auxin flux, causing preferred transport channels to appear, similar to rivers in a landscape. This research provides insights into the complex process of plant development and vein formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
