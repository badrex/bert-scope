CRP activates expression from over 100 different promoters in E. coli and binds to target promoters depending on cyclic AMP. The study identifies the regions of CRP that make contact with RNA polymerase and suggests models for the organization of transcriptionally competent ternary CRP-RNAP-promoter complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
