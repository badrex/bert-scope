Clay content significantly influences soil properties, such as water retention, nutrient availability, and soil structure. The article explores the effects of clay minerals on soil fertility and the challenges in predicting soil behavior based on clay mineralogy. It highlights the need for better understanding of real clays in soil and their effects on soil bulk properties to improve agricultural productivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
