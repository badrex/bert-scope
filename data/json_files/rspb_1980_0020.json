This method creates a raw primal sketch, which is a primitive description of the image, and helps in understanding the goals of early image analysis in vision. The theory explains several psychophysical findings and provides a basis for a physiological model of simple cells in the visual cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Computer Science > Image Processing"}
