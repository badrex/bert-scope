They discovered that the p.s.n. contains numerous cell bodies and is involved in the sensory system of the gastric mill. Intracellular recordings showed that cells in the p.s.n. are proprioceptors, and the nerve plays a role in the reflex control of the gastric mill's activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurophysiology"}
