It highlights the importance of combining protein crystallography with spectroscopic studies, such as extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS), to provide accurate interatomic distances and structural information. The article also advocates for using bond valence sum analysis and a distortional theorem to inspect the details of the geometry of metal binding sites in proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Coordination Chemistry"}
