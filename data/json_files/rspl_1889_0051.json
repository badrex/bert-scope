They discover that nicotin paralyzes the cells of the superior cervical ganglion, which contains dilator fibers for the pupil, vaso-constrictor fibers for the ear, and vaso-motor fibers for the head and secretory fibers for the salivary glands. This research provides insight into the functioning of the sympathetic nervous system and the effects of certain substances on nerve cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nervous System"}
