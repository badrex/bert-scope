They also calculate ionization potentials for these structures, finding that the electrons in structure B are more accessible and likely to be involved in coordination. This study provides insights into the magnetic behavior and oxygen binding of haemoglobin complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
