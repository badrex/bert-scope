The author finds that the period for these tides is the fifth lunar transit preceding each tide. The research also examines the diurnal inequalities at other locations, such as Liverpool, Bristol, Leith, and the east coast of America, and observes a regular pattern along the coastlines.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
