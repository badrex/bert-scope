This finding raises questions about the function of arterial endothelium and the role of LDL in the development of atherosclerosis. The research also introduces a new method to collect interstitial fluid from intima or inner media for further analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Lipid Metabolism"}
