They used the Marchi degeneration method to create lesions in the thalamus and observed the effects on the surrounding areas. The study provides a better understanding of the thalamus and its connections, contributing to the field of neuroscience.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
