They find that far from the barrier, there is a negative energy density in the vacuum, which is independent of the acceleration of the barrier and depends only on the local acceleration. The boundary conditions become important at moderate distances from the barrier, and the stress tensor still diverges as the inverse cube of the distance from the conductor. This study has implications for understanding the effects of gravity and acceleration on vacuum stress."}
