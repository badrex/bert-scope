They discovered that the accumulation of potassium in the Schwann cell space affects the measurement of the potassium conductance. The authors used different methods to estimate the extent of potassium accumulation and found that the presence of the Schwann cell barrier results in a substantial rise of the external potassium concentration. This alters the final values of the potassium equilibrium potential and the driving force acting on the ions, affecting the estimate of the steady-state potassium conductance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
