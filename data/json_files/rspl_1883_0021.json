The author examines the mathematical character of the problems and introduces a system of formulae that can be applied to various physical questions. The study focuses on the assumptions made in Maxwell's theory of electricity and the effects of these assumptions on the calculations and results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
