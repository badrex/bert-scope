The research finds that A. arbustorum is more common in wetter habitats, while G. nemoralis tends to increase in areas with less plant cover. The authors also note that humidity plays a significant role in the distribution of these species, with G. hortensis favoring wetter habitats. The study provides insights into the factors influencing the distribution of these snail species in their natural environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
