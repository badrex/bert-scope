He discovered that the rotation of an iron ball causes a temporary change in its magnetic field, with the direction of the change depending on the direction of rotation and the position of the compass. This research sheds light on the relationship between rotation and magnetism, and has implications for understanding the Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
