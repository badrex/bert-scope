Linus", "semantic_tags": ["Optics", "Refraction", "Light", "Telescope design", "Experimentation"], "tldr": "Franc. Linus responds to a letter by Isaac Newton about his experiments with light and prisms. Linus argues that Newton's experiment was not conducted under ideal conditions and that the image produced was not transverse but parallel. He also explains the differences in the appearance of images created by a bright cloud and those created by direct sunlight. Linus believes that Newton's conclusions can be better understood by considering the rules of refraction and conducting further experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
