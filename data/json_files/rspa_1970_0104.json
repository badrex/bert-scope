They use the diffusion-convection equation and eigenvalue-eigenvector methods to calculate local and mean concentrations. The results are compared with previous analytical and experimental studies, showing good agreement in the region of common validity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
