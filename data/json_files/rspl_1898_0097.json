He explores the behavior of gases at low temperatures, specifically nitrogen and oxygen, and their effects on vacuum production. Dewar also discusses the methods for achieving high vacua and the spectroscopic examination of various gases, including hydrogen, carbonic oxide, and other volatile components.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
