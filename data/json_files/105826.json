The author, William Hewson, conducted dissections and experiments to understand the structure and function of the lymphatic system, including the lacteals and lymphatics, and their connections to other organs. The study provides insights into the similarities and differences between the lymphatic systems of amphibious animals and birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
