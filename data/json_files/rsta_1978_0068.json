Two clay mineral assemblages are identified: a detrital assemblage of mica with minor chlorite, and a neoformed assemblage of magnesium-rich clay minerals. These clay mineral neoformations resulted from reactions between water masses in which the Germanic and Alpine facies were deposited. The study provides insights into the origins of the European and North African Triassic clays and their relation to facies, lithologies, faunas, and palyno-floras.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Sedimentary Geology"}
