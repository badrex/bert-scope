The author suggests that poisons containing nitrogen and possessing chemical tension can disrupt the balance of elements in the nervous structures, leading to the disintegration of molecules and the eventual destruction of life. The author also discusses the similarities between the action of poisons and the influence of certain substances on combustion, providing a rationale for the action of anesthetics and prussic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Toxicology"}
