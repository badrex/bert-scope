They tested this theory by creating fabricated words for simple actions and found that the sounds produced closely resembled actual words in primitive languages. This suggests that the formation of human speech may have been influenced by pantomimic gestures.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Linguistics"}
