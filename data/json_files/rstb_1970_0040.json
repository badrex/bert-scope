They describe the organization of the vertical lobe, the amacrine cells and their trunks, and the synaptic contacts they receive from the incoming fibers. The study also examines the large cells of the vertical lobe and their dendritic organization, as well as the nerve endings of the 'pain' (nocifensor) axons that enter the neuropil of the vertical lobe.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Amacrine Cells and Synaptic Organization"}
