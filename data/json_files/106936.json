They found that these substances do not change the color of the blood's red matter but can make black blood appear more florid. The author explains this phenomenon using the theories of Kepler, Zucchi, and Delaval, which suggest that the color of a substance depends on the light that is reflected from its internal parts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
