They conclude that the white afterglow is not dependent on the presence of nitrogen and is caused by the reaction of ozone with another product formed by the action of the discharge on moist oxygen. The nature of this product remains for further investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
