The fungus enters the root through root hairs and produces gemmules, which are scattered in the soil and can cause infection. The author also explains the process of budding, similar to that found in Ustilaginese fungi, and discusses the role of gemmules as spores in the infection process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
