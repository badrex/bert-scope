They used a lithium metal target and a carbon scatterer to measure the resonant scattering and found that a substantial amount of 15.1 MeV radiation was produced. The results provide insights into the nuclear properties and help improve the understanding of nuclear reactions and spectroscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
