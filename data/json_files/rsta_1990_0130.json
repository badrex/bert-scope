The quadratic-inverse spectrum estimation technique is used to analyze global ice volume data over the past 700,000 years, revealing systematic departures from the predicted frequencies and phase modulation due to changes in the Earth's precession constant. The author also outlines a new method for estimating transfer functions and discusses the implications of these findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Palaeoclimatology"}
