The author studies and reconstructs the animal's body, including its cephalon, thorax, abdomen, and caudal fan. Sidneyia had unique features like stalked eyes, preoral antennae, and a coxa-body attachment that resembles modern merostomes. The author suggests that Sidneyia was a bottom-living, carnivorous animal that ate larger and harder food than trilobites. Although Sidneyia shares some similarities with merostomes, its body plan and absence of chelicera distinguish it from this group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
