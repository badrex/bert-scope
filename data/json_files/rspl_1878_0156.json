They observed the reversal of lines in various metals, such as calcium, sodium, and potassium, and made recommendations for the use of specific metal alloys in manufacturing. The authors also noted the effects of introducing different gases into the crucibles on the appearance of the lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
