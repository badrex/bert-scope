The authors discuss the structure and composition of these nodules, as well as the possible factors contributing to their formation. The presence of these fossils provides valuable insights into the vegetation and environmental conditions during the coal formation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
