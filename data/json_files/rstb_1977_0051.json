The results show that cats with a reverse suture, where the deprived eye was opened and the non-deprived eye was closed, had a remarkable recovery. The cats with the non-deprived eye removed had the most significant improvement in the visual responses of cortical and collicular neurons. However, the responses were still not completely normal.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
