He made detailed observations of the comet's position, size, and surrounding stars to determine its parallax and better understand its distance from Earth. This information could help other astronomers in different locations make similar observations and calculate the comet's distance more accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
