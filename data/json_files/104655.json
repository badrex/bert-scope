Grischow and M. Kies observed the solar eclipse at the Observatory in Berlin. They recorded the eclipse's start and end times, as well as its duration and the diameter of the umbra. M. Euler, observing from a nearby location, also recorded his own measurements, which differed slightly from those at the Observatory. The weather was favorable for the observations, allowing for accurate measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
