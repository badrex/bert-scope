They propose that these lines are due to the light from the gaseous envelopes surrounding the stars, which becomes more prominent as the distance from the observer increases. This explanation supports the view that nebulae are stellar clusters that are irresolvable due to their great distances. The author also considers the changes in the appearance of nebulae and the difficulty of explaining the existence of isolated irregular masses of gas without a central gravitational mass.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
