This method allows for quicker and more accurate measurements of diffusion constants, especially for high molecular substances. The technique involves creating a sharp initial boundary between a dilute solution and a solvent and observing the interference pattern formed by monochromatic light passing through the diffusion process. This method can be particularly useful for studying the diffusion of single homogeneous solutes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Diffusion and Separation Techniques"}
