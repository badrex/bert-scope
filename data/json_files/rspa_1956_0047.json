The optical absorption also increased, and annealing at red heat only partially restored the counting and optical transparency. The results are interpreted in terms of intrinsic charge traps and additional traps produced by neutrons, indicating that the traps created by neutron irradiation differ from the intrinsic traps in diamonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
