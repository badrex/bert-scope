The researchers discovered a shell of high vector density surrounding the origin, which they believe could provide insights into the protein's structure. The study contributes to the understanding of protein folding and the arrangement of polypeptide chains within the molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
