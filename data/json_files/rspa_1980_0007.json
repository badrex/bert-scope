The author constructs a composite asymptotic expansion using Taylor shock transitions and shows that this representation is an exact solution of the Burgers equation. This solution, known as the Fay solution, has a simple interpretation as a periodic array of spreading shocks that do not interact as they interpenetrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
