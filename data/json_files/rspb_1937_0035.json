They found that 3:4:5:6-dibenzcarbazole was highly toxic and carcinogenic, causing skin tumors in mice. The authors also observed significant liver changes, including hyperplasia of bile ducts and nodular growth, in mice treated with 3:4:5:6-dibenzcarbazole. These findings suggest a potential link between exposure to dibenzcarbazoles and occupational cancers, particularly bladder cancer, among chemical workers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Carcinogenic substances"}
