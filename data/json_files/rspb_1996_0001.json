The authors model the growth of cells under the influence of these morphogens and demonstrate how unstable growth, influenced by membrane conductance, galvanotropism, and chemotropism, leads to complex branching patterns. This self-organizing pattern formation aligns with the development of real neurons under similar conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
