They found that several species of aquatic macrophytes coexist with snail species, and some plants have positive or negative effects on snail populations. The authors propose integrated control measures for lotic and lentic habitats, including manipulating environmental factors, controlling aquatic vegetation, and introducing predators or non-host molluscs.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
