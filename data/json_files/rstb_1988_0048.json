They have assigned the cystic fibrosis locus to chromosome 7's long arm, within the region of band q31. By isolating new probes from the 7q31 region, they aim to create a fine genetic and physical map for the chromosomal region surrounding the cystic fibrosis gene, which will help identify the affected gene and improve understanding of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
