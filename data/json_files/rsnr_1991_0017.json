This incident highlights the challenges faced by scientists working in colonial situations, including communication difficulties and lack of familiarity with the conventions of metropolitan science. Dawson's lecture was not published in the Philosophical Transactions, despite being delivered by other notable scientists in the past. The rejection sheds light on the historical development of the Royal Society's publications and the challenges faced by natural historians in gaining recognition within the scientific community.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
