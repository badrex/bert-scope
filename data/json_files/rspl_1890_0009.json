They find that the diphtheria bacillus is present in both cases and can be transmitted through contact with infected animals or contaminated milk. The author also demonstrates that the disease in cats is primarily a lung disease, similar to human diphtheria, and that the bacillus can cause damage to the lungs and kidneys of infected animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
