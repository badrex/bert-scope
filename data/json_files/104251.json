He found that water is more elastic than air when agitated by fire. Clayton demonstrated this by heating a sealed container with water and air, which resulted in a loud explosion. This discovery showed the power of water's elasticity and the importance of understanding the behavior of fluids under pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fluid dynamics"}
