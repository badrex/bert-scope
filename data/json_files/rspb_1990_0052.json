The research reveals that the fluctuations in lake levels have created opportunities for allopatric speciation, leading to the rapid establishment of unique fish faunas. The findings provide insights into the evolution and diversification of the cichlid species in the lake.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
