They also discuss the complexity of velocity changes in the wave motion and its relation to Hertz's interference experiments. The authors expand and modify Hertz's theoretical oscillator investigation, providing a new perspective on the topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
