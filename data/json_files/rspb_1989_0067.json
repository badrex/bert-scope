The researchers used transcriptional and translational inhibitors to determine the sites of synthesis for various polypeptides. They found that about 70% of the proteins in the soluble fraction are synthesized in the host cytoplasm, while 70% of the thylakoid proteins are synthesized within the cyanellae. This research provides insights into the complex relationship between the nuclear-organellar and chloroplast genetic systems in plants and algae."}
