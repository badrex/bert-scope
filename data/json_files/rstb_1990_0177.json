It presents various models, including single and multicompartmental models, to represent the decomposition of organic matter in soil over a timespan of years to centuries. The Rothamsted turnover model is described in detail, which provides a useful representation of data from long-term field experiments. The models take into account factors such as soil temperature, moisture content, and soil texture, which influence the decomposition process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
