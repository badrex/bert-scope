The research finds that cotton yields are highly correlated with rainfall, and seasonal fluctuations in rainfall can account for most of the decline in yield on older areas. The findings have practical implications for understanding soil fertility and pest control in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agricultural Meteorology"}
