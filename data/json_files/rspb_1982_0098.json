The researchers found that the unidirectional inward Na+ flux depends on the concentration of Na+ ions within the cell. They developed a model of an asymmetrical voltage-controlled ion channel that assumes only single occupancy of the channel, which simulates the observed behavior. This model can help understand the response of epithelial sodium channels to divalent ions and improve our knowledge of ion transport in cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
