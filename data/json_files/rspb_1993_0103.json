They suggest that the discrepancies may be due to differences in avian and primate color vision. Pigeons can perceive ultraviolet wavelengths and have four or five types of cone cells, while humans have three. This allows pigeons to see colors that humans cannot and may explain why some hoverfly species are considered good wasp mimics by pigeons, even if they appear poor mimics to the human eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
