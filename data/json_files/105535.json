He used a reflecting telescope and a meridian line to make precise measurements. The observations showed that the Moon's eastern and western limbs had different appearances during the eclipse, and he speculated about the Moon's latitude and the apparent altitudes of the Sun and Moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
