The research shows that chicks exhibit a greater aversion towards larger, more aposematic prey after one experience of aposematic bugs. This peak-shift phenomenon can help explain the evolution of aposematic strategies in prey species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
