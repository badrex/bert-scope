Fowler and W. H. Reynolds discovered new triplets and series lines in the spectrum of magnesium. They used the Rydberg formula and Hicks equation to analyze the wavelengths and oscillation frequencies of the observed lines. Their findings contribute to the understanding of series lines and the atomic structure of magnesium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
