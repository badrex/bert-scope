The authors found that the rate of diffusion remains constant and is independent of pressure at certain ranges. They also discovered that the temperature coefficient for the diffusion of hydrogen is high, and the rate of diffusion follows the square root law. The results provide insight into the mechanisms of gas diffusion through metals and the properties of nickel.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
