The device, developed by G. Manzoni and C. Marchesini, is a Michelson interferometer with a He-Ne laser source. It is used in conjunction with a horizontal wire strainmeter from the University of Cambridge to study seismic activity and the Earth's crust behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
