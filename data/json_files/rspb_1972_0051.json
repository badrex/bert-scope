The authors highlight the challenges of using major gene and field-resistance mechanisms and suggest that a combination of both offers more promise. They also introduce a new approach, Fx-hybrid varieties, to exploit inter-varietal and inter-specific sources of resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
