They use a preferred bifurcation diagram method, which is based on properties of the Jacobi equation, to analyze the stability of various equilibria and provide a classification system for capillary surfaces. This approach can be applied to other capillary surfaces, such as drops and non-axisymmetric shapes.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
