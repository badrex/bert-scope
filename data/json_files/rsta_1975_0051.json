It examines various lines of evidence for former glaciation, including geomorphological features such as flat featureless sea beds, terrace forms, and palaeovalley systems. The distribution of erratics on the Channel floor and in modern and raised beaches of its coasts is attributed to widespread Saalian glaciation. The article also explores the different geomorphological features of the Channel floor, such as low relief areas, submarine shelves, and submerged cliffs, and their significance in understanding the Quaternary history of the region."}
