He confirms Poisson's theory and verifies his conclusions through experiments on ellipsoids of soft iron and various crystals, including red ferrocyanide of iron, sulphate of zinc, and formicate of copper. The study reveals the existence of three principal axes of magnetic induction and demonstrates the differences in magnetic properties among crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
