The author presents a theoretical analysis and an iterative method to predict the frequencies of vibration in cantilever beams. Experiments conducted on an I-section cantilever carrying an end mass support the theoretical analysis and provide insight into the behavior of beams under lateral instability.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
