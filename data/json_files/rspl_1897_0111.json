The author, Karl Pearson, applies the theory of skew variation to analyze the data and finds that the frequency distribution is J-shaped. The study demonstrates the capacity of the theory of skew variation to cover unusual types of frequency.", "scientific_discipline": "Statistics > Skew distribution"}
