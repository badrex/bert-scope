A. Broun, discusses the lunar-diurnal variation of magnetic declination and its relation to the solar-diurnal variation. He explains that the lunar-diurnal variation becomes inverted when the sun passes from one hemisphere to another, and that this inversion is also observed in the solar-diurnal variation. Broun also notes that the mean law for a north latitude should be the inverse of that for a south latitude, and that a maximum of easterly declination in one hemisphere should be simultaneous or nearly so with a minimum in the other.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
