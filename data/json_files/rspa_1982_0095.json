The author demonstrates that the strength of a bundle or a series-parallel system has an approximate Weibull distribution with a shape parameter, which is consistent with previous numerical calculations and has consequences for the size effect in composites.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
