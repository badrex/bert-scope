The author develops the wave equation and discusses the behavior of charged vector mesons in an electromagnetic field. The article focuses on the motion of mesons in a central field and the radial wave equations, providing a foundation for understanding meson interactions and scattering phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
