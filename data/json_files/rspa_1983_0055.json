It discusses the Noyes and Smoluchowski theories, which are proven to be equivalent on a lattice. The author analyzes the Noyes theory and predicts the kinetics of the two-dimensional irreversible reaction. The theoretical rate function is determined as a function of the probability of reaction given an encounter, and the results are compared with computer simulations and fluorescence quenching experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
