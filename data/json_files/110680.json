He concludes that the electricity of the pile originates from the chemical force of the acting bodies and that heat has a significant influence on the electric current. Faraday also examines the phenomena of thermo-electricity and disproves the existence of contact electromotive force.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
