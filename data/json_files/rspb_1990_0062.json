By occasionally killing and consuming each other, termites and Cryptocercus could have exchanged gut protozoa under natural conditions. This suggests that the presence of closely related symbionts in both Cryptocercus and termites may not be a uniquely derived homologous character shared between the two xylophagous groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
