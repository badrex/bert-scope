The authors extended the work of previous researchers, such as Reynolds and Stanton, to include a wider range of velocities and pipe dimensions. They found that the frictional resistance in pipes can be expressed mathematically, and they provide a formula for calculating the pressure drop in pipes conveying steam and other vapors.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
