They consider a special case of uniform normal pressure applied over the cavity surface and analyze the wave system generated by the primary disturbance. The study provides insights into the behavior of Stoneley waves and their travel paths in the liquid layer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
