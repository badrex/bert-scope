They discovered that these cells undergo structural and synaptic reorganizations, such as dendritic and axonal growth, somatic swelling, and dye-coupling. These findings suggest that goldfish retinal ganglion cells may have a similar regenerative competence to mammalian retinal ganglion cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
