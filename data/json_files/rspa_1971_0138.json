They consider a small element of the surface and relate the rate of transfer of the isotope to the rate at which all molecules of the exchanging species undergo exchange at that element. The Elovich equation for the whole surface is obtained by an approximate integration, assuming that the activation energies for exchange are a linear function of the concentration. This equation can be used to obtain concentration-independent rate constants from the parameters and, providing a better understanding of the kinetics of heterogeneous isotopic exchange reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
