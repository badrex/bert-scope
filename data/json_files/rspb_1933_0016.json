They found that a homogeneous beam of X-rays had a greater biological effect per unit intensity compared to a heterogeneous beam. The study also demonstrated that there was an antagonism between X-rays of different wavelengths in their biological effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
