They found that the rate of adsorption depends primarily on pressure rather than temperature, and they determined the activation energy and other parameters related to the deposition process. This research contributes to the understanding of adsorption phenomena and the development of better materials and techniques for various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Science"}
