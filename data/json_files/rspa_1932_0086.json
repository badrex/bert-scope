They used a differential ionization chamber and automatic counter to measure the mean ranges of the alpha particles and found that the -rays from actinium-A form a single homogeneous group, while those from actinon consist of two groups. This research contributes to the understanding of radioactive transformations and the properties of alpha particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
