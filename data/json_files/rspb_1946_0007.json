Avery's research on the pneumococcus led to the discovery of a chemical principle that induces genetic transformation. Bernal's work in X-ray crystallography helped elucidate the structures of complex organic molecules and proteins. Salisbury's studies on plant communities and autecology have broadened the understanding of British plant habitats and species' reproductive efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
