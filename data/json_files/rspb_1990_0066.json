They found that both the Weis and Genty models could predict photosynthetic electron transport, but the Genty model was more accurate. This study helps us understand how plants use light energy for photosynthesis and how different factors affect the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
