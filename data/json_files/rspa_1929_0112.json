They demonstrate that X-ray spectroscopy is more sensitive and accurate than optical spectroscopy, allowing for the detection of elements in trace amounts. The authors also address the challenges and future improvements for the X-ray spectroscopy method.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
