It explores their physiology, metabolism, and ecological roles in various environments. The study focuses on the sulfur-oxidizing chemolithotrophs, their energy generation from the oxidation of reduced inorganic sulfur compounds, and their interactions with other organisms and the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Microbiology > Microbial Ecology"}
