They employ a statistical theory to analyze the effects of strong coupling between different scattering channels. The study provides numerical results for the collision of helium and nitrogen at room temperature, contributing to the understanding of atomic and molecular interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Molecular Physics"}
