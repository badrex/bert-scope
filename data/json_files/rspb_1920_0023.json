They found that vegetative cultures from the male and female organs produced monoecious plants, indicating that the cells of the haploid gametophytic phase retain the power to produce these plants. The authors also observed that the female shoot's potentialities are different from the male shoot, and they discuss the morphological relation and cell-lineage of the two parts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
