He discovered its properties, such as its disagreeable smell, inflammability, miscibility with water, and ability to discolour metals. Hepatic air plays an important role in nature, being found in coal mines and mineral waters. It is also believed to be a product of the putrefaction of animal substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Environmental and Earth Sciences"}
