The authors analyze the data from various sources and conclude that the observed element abundances can be explained by the Big Bang and subsequent stellar nucleosynthesis. The findings have interesting cosmological implications, such as the likelihood of a unique helium abundance in the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Cosmology"}
