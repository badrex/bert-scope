The authors measure the densities of phenol-water solutions at various concentrations and temperatures, observing a critical solution temperature where the densities of the two phases become equal. They also discuss the possibility of ionization in highly concentrated phenol solutions and the relationship between the density and temperature of the conjugate solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution Chemistry"}
