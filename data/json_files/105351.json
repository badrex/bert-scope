He observes a gland and two bodies, which he believes may be the creature's stomach and intestines, and discusses their possible functions. Peyssonel also notes the creature's square body, armed with prickles, and how they function as feet. He mentions the pain caused by the prickles when they enter the skin, but reports no further ill consequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Invertebrate Zoology"}
