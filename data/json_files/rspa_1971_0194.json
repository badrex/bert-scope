They derive a perturbation expansion of the Dirac density matrix in terms of the Hartree-Fock density, obtaining the exchange energy. This work provides a useful generalization of Dirac-Slater theory for atoms, molecules, and non-metallic crystals, and it can help understand the electronic structure of materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Chemistry"}
