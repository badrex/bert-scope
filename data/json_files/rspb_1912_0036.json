They find that antelope, particularly bushbuck and Situtanga, may act as reservoirs for the disease, increasing the chances of wild flies spreading the infection. The study also discusses the possibility of reptiles serving as reservoirs, but further research is needed due to difficulties in obtaining live specimens. The author concludes that understanding the role of antelope in disease transmission is crucial for controlling the spread of trypanosomiasis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Epidemiology"}
