The authors develop a method to relate the Green function of a nucleon in an external field with radiative corrections to that of a nucleon in an arbitrary external field without radiative corrections. They provide a closed-form solution for the Green function and discuss its singularities, which are expected to exhibit similar behavior in more realistic cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
