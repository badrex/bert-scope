The author, Richard L. Maddox, describes two methods of nerve termination and their relation to the muscles. He also discusses the blood corpuscles, or creeping corpuscles, and their importance in the movement of living matter. The research highlights the difficulties in accurately depicting the nervous and muscular structures due to factors like muscular contraction and tissue thickness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
