The researchers found three types of cholinergic receptors on feeding neurons and determined that the sign of cholinergic response for each feeding motoneuron matches the synaptic input received during the N1 phase of the feeding rhythm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
