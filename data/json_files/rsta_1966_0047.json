{"article_id": "rsta_1966_0047", "revised_title": "Cavitation Damage in Solids: Mechanisms and Implications", "semantic_tags": ["Cavitation", "Fluid dynamics", "Solid mechanics", "Shockwaves", "Material damage"], "tldr": "The article discusses the mechanisms of cavitation damage in solids, focusing on the role of shockwaves from cavity collapse. The authors explore the stress pulses and temperature changes that accompany bubble collapse, and their potential to cause damage to solid surfaces. They also consider the possibility of jet formation and its impact on material damage. While the exact mechanisms of cavitation damage remain uncertain, the article highlights the need for further experimental evidence to better understand the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
