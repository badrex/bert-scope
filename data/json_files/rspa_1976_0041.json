They determine the second two-dimensional virial coefficient and analyze the effects of perturbation terms, three-body interactions, and surface structure on the adsorption process. The results suggest a larger attractive gas-crystal interaction than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Science"}
