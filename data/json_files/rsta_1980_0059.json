The author reviews the different types of bonding that can occur between fibrous materials and organic polymers, including mechanical, physical, and chemical bonding. Surface treatments, such as chemical modification, sizing, and polymer fixation, are explored to optimize fiber-resin interactions and improve the interface properties of composite materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
