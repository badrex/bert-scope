The study focuses on stress distributions in a plate under uniform tension parallel to its faces, providing numerical work for the case when the hole's diameter is equal to the plate's thickness. The research aims to extend the scope of two-dimensional stress analysis and assess the validity of the generalized plane stress theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
