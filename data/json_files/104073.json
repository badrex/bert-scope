The polypus was fibrous, hollow, and resembled the structure of vessels in the lungs. The author suggests that this phenomenon may explain a similar case described by Tulpius and provides insights into the nature of the polypus and its relation to the respiratory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
