They found that the stagnation point for an inviscid flow does not always agree with that measured in a wind tunnel, and the differences increase with the magnitude of the circulation. The pressure distribution in the immediate vicinity of the stagnation point and over a large part of the nose is more closely represented by theory when using the circulation that makes the stagnation points coincide.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
