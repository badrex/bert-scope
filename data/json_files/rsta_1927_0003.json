Kamerlingh Onnes, investigates paramagnetism at low temperatures. They determine the susceptibilities with an accuracy of about 1% using the Faraday method and a quartz microbalance. The experiments are conducted in a cryostat with liquid air as the cooling agent, and the results provide insights into the behavior of materials under extreme conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
