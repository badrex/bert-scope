It shows that calcium is essential for the hyperpolarization and increase in membrane conductance caused by adrenaline. The research also demonstrates that magnesium and sodium ions can affect the response to adrenaline by modifying the amount of calcium at the strategic site and influencing calcium movement across the membrane."}
