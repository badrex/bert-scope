This new approximation improves upon previous methods by being accurate across a wide range of operating parameters, even near cut-off conditions. The accuracy of the new approximation is demonstrated by comparing it with exact results, showing typical errors of only 3% even for modest values of reduced frequency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
