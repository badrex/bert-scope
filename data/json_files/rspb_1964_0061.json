It confirms earlier findings of adenine nucleotide concentration in the I-band and provides evidence that a large proportion of the nucleotide lies in the inter-fibrillar spaces rather than in the fibrils themselves. The presence of vesicles in the inter-fibrillar spaces, which are components of the sarcoplasmic reticulum, suggests that the nucleotide is concentrated within these vesicles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
