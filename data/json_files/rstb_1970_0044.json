The hypothesis of X inactivation was first proposed to explain the variegated phenotype of female mice heterozygous for X-linked color genes. The evidence for X inactivation and its role in sex chromosome abnormalities is examined, including the phenotypes of heterozygotes and the patterns produced by genes acting through somite or neural crest cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
