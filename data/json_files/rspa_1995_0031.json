They find that these complex eigenvalues represent inertia-gravity wave solutions that can be excited by the presence of meridional boundaries and decay away from them. The study examines the eigenvalue spectrum for semi-diurnal, fortnightly, and monthly tides, with implications for understanding the dynamical response of ocean basins to low-frequency tidal forcing.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
