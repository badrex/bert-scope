The author concludes that atropine does not affect emotive responses, and the results differ from previous experiments by Dr. Leva. Possible reasons for the discrepancy include individual differences in atropine effects and technical errors in measuring resistance and sensitivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Emotion and Arousal"}
