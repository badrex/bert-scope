Although it did not dramatically affect the industry at the time, the programme contributed to the development of new attitudes towards industry, which eventually led to the Industrial Revolution. The programme also played a crucial role in transferring craft knowledge to industry-supported scholars, laying the foundation for the modern scientific-technological revolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > History of Science"}
