The microscope is equipped with a field-emitting electron gun and a concentric hemispherical energy analyser, providing better collection efficiency and energy resolution. This innovation allows for the study of surface processes and the analysis of impurities at grain boundaries, surface diffusion, and various surface sites in processes such as absorption, catalysis, oxidation, corrosion, and segregation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electron Microscopy"}
