The research found that fractional rates of protein growth and synthesis increased with consumption rate, while degradation rates were independent of consumption. More efficient fish had reduced degradation rates, which could explain the observed differences in protein growth efficiency. The results support the hypothesis that individual differences in protein turnover are important determinants of growth efficiency in fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
