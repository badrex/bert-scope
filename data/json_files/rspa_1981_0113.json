These profiles include ridged sheets, planar sheets, and S-shaped sheets. The research helps classify the textures of melt-crystallized polyethylene and provides insights into the crystallography and growth conditions of polyethylene lamellae.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
