The study found that scattered worker bees are attracted to clusters by a combination of scent, vibration, temperature, and sight. Queens play a crucial role in keeping worker bees together, serving as a powerful attraction. The attraction to these stimuli is likely an important adaptation for social life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
