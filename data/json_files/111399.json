The author, A. W. Hofmann, describes the experiments conducted by M. Zervas and Mr. Baldwin Duppa in his laboratory, which resulted in the discovery of sulphanisic acid and disulphophenic acid. The findings demonstrate the similarity in the action of sulfuric acid on organic acids with 4 and 6 oxygen equivalents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
