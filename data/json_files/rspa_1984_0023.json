They derive a formula for this phase factor in terms of the eigenstates of the system's Hamiltonian and show that it contains a circuit-dependent component. The author also demonstrates how this phase factor can be used to understand the Aharonov-Bohm effect and the sign change of spinors in slowly-rotated magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
