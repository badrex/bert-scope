It found that maximum survival occurs at a specific cell density, with survival being proportionally less at higher and lower densities. The findings suggest that bacterial cells can interact and support each other's survival in nutrient-deprived conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
