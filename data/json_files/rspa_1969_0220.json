The method is based on the principles of concentration gradients and streaming potentials. Results are in agreement with other methods, and the technique offers advantages in terms of time efficiency and applicability to certain chemicals. The underlying principles of osmotic methods and the effects of unstirred layers are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Physiology"}
