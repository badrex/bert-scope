Female swallows may use fluctuating asymmetry in male ornaments as a reliable cue for male quality. The cost of fluctuating asymmetry in tail size affects maneuverability during flight, suggesting that asymmetry and inherent differences between individuals impact flight performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
