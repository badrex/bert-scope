The lecture was attended by senior members of the university, showing their interest in the new field of geology despite religious opposition. Buckland's work in geology and paleontology helped reconcile scientific findings with religious beliefs, and his research on the Mosaic deluge contributed to the understanding of diluvial deposits and antediluvial fauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
