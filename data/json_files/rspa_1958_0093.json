They derive the Kuster isotherm for charged films at the oil/water interface and discuss the relation between surface pressure and concentration. The findings contribute to understanding the behavior of long-chain ions and their applications in surface chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
