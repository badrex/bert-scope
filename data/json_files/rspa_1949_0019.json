They found that the superlattice in this alloy is more stable than in other Heusler alloys. The alloy exhibits ferromagnetism and has a higher magnetization when quenched. The research suggests that manganese behaves as a univalent element in this alloy, which is important for understanding its magnetic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
