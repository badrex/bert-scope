Dr. Halley explains that the apparent position of celestial objects is affected by the refraction of light as it passes through the Earth's atmosphere. He presents a table to help astronomers calculate the necessary corrections for their observations, allowing for more accurate measurements of celestial distances and positions.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
