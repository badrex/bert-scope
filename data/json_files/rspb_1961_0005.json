Rats that experienced rapid growth showed more active and inquisitive behavior, as well as quicker learning compared to their slower-growing littermates. The research suggests that nutritional variables may play a role in the correlation between physical and mental development in children, and that faster-growing children may display greater mental activity and learning abilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
