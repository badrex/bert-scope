Silvester, examines the typical forms and functions of the large secreting organs in the human body, such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, stomach, intestines, and reproductive organs. He proposes a new nomenclature for these organs based on their functions and offers insights into their development and adaptations. The study reveals the uniformity and complexity of these organs, which are essential for the human body's overall functioning.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
