They discovered that a magnetic field could prevent negatively charged particles from reaching a plate, and that the positive current from one plate to another consisted of two parts: a stream of \u03b1 particles and a stream of negatively charged particles. This research provided insights into the behavior of particles under electric and magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
