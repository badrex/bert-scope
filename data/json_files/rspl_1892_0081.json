They discovered the formation and structure of the nephridia, the role of the dorsal sac, and the similarities between the larva's anatomy and that of Peripatus. This research provides insights into the renal organs and body cavity development in decapod crustaceans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
