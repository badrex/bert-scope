The meteor appeared as a bright globe that moved across the sky and then vanished. A narrow luminous streak remained after the globe disappeared, allowing for an estimation of its elevation. The phenomenon resembled a long, bright cloud and provided an opportunity for further astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational astronomy"}
