The study focuses on the contribution of intersystem crossing to triplet state formation and the quenching of excited singlet states. The results provide insights into the role of singlet state quenchers in the photochemistry and radiation chemistry of aromatic hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
