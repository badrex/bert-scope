They explain that porphyrins served as early photosynthetic pigments and that early photosynthesis occurred in the ocean without much cellular organization. The author also highlights the importance of these molecules in generating the thermodynamic gradient needed for the functioning of living cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
