They discovered that the spinal accessory nerve provides most of the motor fibers in the vagus nerve, which control the movement of the larynx, heart, and stomach. The study also found that the motor fibers distributed to the heart and stomach are mainly nucleated or \"Remak\" fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nerve Physiology"}
