They found that in nearly all cases, the fossil teeth did not differ significantly from one or other type of extant great ape. This study aimed to analyze the dental characteristics of fossil anthropoids and their relation to modern apes, contributing to the understanding of human evolution and the classification of these ancient species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anthropology"}
