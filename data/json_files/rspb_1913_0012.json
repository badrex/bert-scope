They found that tumors generally contain higher amounts of manganese than normal tissues, and that the element's distribution in tumors may be important for understanding species origins, biochemical adaptations, and the effects of different diets. The authors used a colorimetric method to analyze the manganese content in the tumors and provided a detailed analysis of the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
