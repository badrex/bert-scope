They faced challenges such as wind affecting the instruments, especially the dip-instrument. The author determined the absolute azimuths of the theodolite to eliminate the effects of a trip or of the chronometer. The observations helped in understanding the variations in horizontal force and dip in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
