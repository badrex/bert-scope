Winge made significant contributions to the fields of genetics, cytology, and yeast genetics. He worked with various species, including Erophila, Lebistes reticulatus, and yeasts, and was a pioneer in the study of polyploidy and species hybridization. His work on chromosome cytology and the importance of chromosome homology in species hybrids laid the foundation for understanding polyploid evolution and speciation. Winge's research also led to the development of the 'Carlsberg II' barley, which was widely grown in Denmark for many years."}
