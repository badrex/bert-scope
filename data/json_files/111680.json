Hofmann, investigates the molecular constitution and reactions of nitrophenylenediamine, a nitrogenous compound. He discovers that nitrophenylenediamine is a monacid base and can undergo unique acid-base reactions. The study sheds light on the properties and stability of ammonia derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
