The system uses satellite signals and a synchronized clock to calculate the distance between the user and the satellites, allowing for precise determination of the user's location. The GPS has various applications, including geodetic and geophysical studies, where high accuracy is required, and navigation, where lower accuracy is sufficient. The system's accuracy is expected to be around 10 meters for instantaneous absolute positions and up to 1 cm for relative positions within a day.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Satellite Technology"}
