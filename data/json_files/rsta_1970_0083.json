The author compares the radiocarbon and historical chronologies, finding that they align well for the time period up to the XII dynasty. The author also explores the discrepancies between radiocarbon dates and historical chronology, suggesting that the differences may be due to secular variations in the level of radiocarbon activity in the atmosphere. The study uses a calibration based on the relationship between conventional radiocarbon dates and dendrochronologically determined wood ages from bristlecone pine to approximate the historical chronology.", "scientific_discipline": "Archaeology > Radiocarbon dating"}
