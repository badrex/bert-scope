The Institution attracted support from notable figures like Gilbert Giddy, Humphry Davy, and the Lunar Society. However, Joseph Banks, President of the Royal Society, withheld his support due to political differences with Beddoes. The story of the Pneumatic Institution highlights the intersection of science, politics, and medical practice during the 18th century.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
