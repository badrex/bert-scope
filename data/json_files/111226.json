Lockhart Clark, conducted experiments on various animals to study the spinal chord and nerve roots. He discovered three types of posterior nerve root fibers and found that most nerve fibers proceed directly to the grey substance of the spinal chord. The communication between the sensorium and spinal nerves is established through the antero-lateral columns, particularly the lateral ones. The author also observed a correspondence in the fibrous arrangement between the grey substance of the spinal chord and the chiasma of the optic nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
