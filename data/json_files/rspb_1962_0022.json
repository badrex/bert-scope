The results show that drugs cause changes in cell size, growth patterns, and nucleic acid-protein content. When bacteria are returned to a drug-free medium, some of these changes persist or show an overshoot phenomenon. The findings suggest that the systems in the cells are interdependent and loosely linked, with phase relations being disturbed by abnormal conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
