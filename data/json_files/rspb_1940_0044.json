The experiments show that these compounds prolong the minimum interval for a summated muscular response and slow the peripheral recovery process. The study also reveals that curarine or atropine can reverse the prolongation of the minimum interval.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
