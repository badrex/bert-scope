They found that the product of atomic number and atomic frequency can be expressed as a simple multiple of a definite frequency. This discovery supports the idea that the atomic frequency is related to the atomic number and provides evidence for the validity of quantum theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
