They establish a lower bound for the Hilbert numbers, which is related to the number of limit cycles in these systems. The study provides insights into the behavior of polynomial systems and contributes to the understanding of Hilbert's 16th problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
