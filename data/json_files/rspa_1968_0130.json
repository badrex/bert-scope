They found that the reaction is entirely free radical in nature and identified five main products: hydrogen, methane, ethylene, propylene, and ethane. The authors determined the stoichiometry of the reaction and observed that the rate was significantly inhibited even at trivial extents of reaction, making it difficult to measure uninhibited rates. The study provides valuable insights into the processes involved in self-inhibition and the initial stages of propane pyrolysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
