It explores the origins, characteristics, and roles of these lineaments in the Earth's crust, as well as their connection to plate tectonics and the evolution of continents. The article highlights the complexity and longevity of these lineaments, which have persisted from the Archean to the present day and have played a significant role in the Earth's geological history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
