The study focuses on idealized models of earthquakes and fault planes, providing a mathematical framework for understanding the mechanics of earthquakes and calculating the relative displacement across fault planes. The results are presented graphically and can be applied to two-dimensional problems in anti-plane and plane strain.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
