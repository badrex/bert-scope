The results show that all teeth in these reptiles were replaced at least once, unlike in mammals where molars are not replaced. The research also reveals the unique method of shedding teeth in these reptiles, which is different from the process in mammals. The findings provide insights into the evolution of mammalian dentition and the relationship between these reptiles and the ancestors of mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
