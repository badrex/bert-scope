The first category involves uncontrolled events, such as intergeneric translocations induced by mutagenic agents. The second category is based on the unusual genetic characteristics of chromosomes 5B and 4A. The third category is associated with a male-sterility mutation on chromosome 4A. The article highlights the potential impact of these manipulations on plant improvement and the developments in this area of research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
