Radar studies revealed that strong thermal contrasts between land and sea surfaces led to significant redistribution of the airborne moths. Meteorologists identified synoptic situations that favored the development of these mesoscale features, which helped in forecasting and monitoring insect populations and controlling epidemic outbreaks.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
