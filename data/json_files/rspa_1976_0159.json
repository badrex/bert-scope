They show that the previously proposed choices of weighting factors, SC1NCH and PETCH, are identical for these new approximants. The approximants derived from the series in these new variables possess desirable covariance properties and can be used to represent functions of two variables more effectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
