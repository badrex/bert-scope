They discover that local hot spots play a significant role in the growth and propagation of explosions, and that the mechanisms for initiation and propagation are similar for both liquid and solid explosives. The research provides insights into the fundamental processes of explosions and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
