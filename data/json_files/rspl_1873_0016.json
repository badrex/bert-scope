The author found that the acoustic transparency of the atmosphere varies greatly and can be affected by factors such as weather conditions and the presence of water vapor. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between optical and acoustic transparency.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
