It highlights improvements in temperature capability and apparatus reliability, allowing exploration of higher temperatures and lower stresses and strain rates. The article also explores the different deformation mechanisms, such as cataclastic, crystal-plastic, and diffusional flow, and their implications for understanding rock behavior under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
