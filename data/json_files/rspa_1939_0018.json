It explains how various experimental procedures, such as ultracentrifugal sedimentation, diffusion, osmotic pressure, electrophoresis, X-ray analysis, viscosity, and enzymatic decomposition, help in understanding the mass, shape, and chemical properties of protein molecules. The article also highlights the rule of simple multiples for molecular weights and the reversible dissociation and association of proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
