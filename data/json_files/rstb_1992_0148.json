It highlights the vulnerability of polar species to changes in climate and the importance of understanding the responses of terrestrial biota to environmental change. The article also explores the potential feedbacks from polar vegetation and ecosystems to the climate system, with positive feedbacks associated with decreases in reflectivity and increased carbon emissions from warming soils.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Change and Ecosystems"}
