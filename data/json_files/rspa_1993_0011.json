They show that by choosing the zero-order term in the perturbation expansion, the radius of the limit cycle can be unaffected by higher-order corrections. This simplifies the calculation of the basic frequency of oscillations and avoids the need to update the radius of the limit circle in higher orders of the perturbation expansion.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
