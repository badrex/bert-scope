They discovered that longitudinal pull decreases magnetization when the magnetizing force is below a critical value, while transverse pull has the opposite effect. The critical value for longitudinal pull was found to be about 23 times the Glasgow vertical force, while for transverse pull, it was about 60 times the Glasgow vertical force. These findings have implications for understanding the behavior of magnetic materials under stress and could lead to improvements in technology that relies on magnetic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
