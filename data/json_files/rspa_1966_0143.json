They observed a relative change in the phase of neck and belly oscillations, indicating that the neck cross-sections increase in size more than the bellies. The results show that the Fermi surface of these noble metals is distorted under pressure, with the overall rates of increase for neck cross-sections being significantly higher than expected if the Fermi surface simply expanded uniformly with the Brillouin zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
