The observations were conducted at various locations, including Cairo, the Nile Valley, and oases in the Libyan Desert. The data collected was used to determine the declination, dip, and horizontal force of the Earth's magnetic field at these locations. The results provide insights into the average annual rate of change in these magnetic field components during that time period.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
