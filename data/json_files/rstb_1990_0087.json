It highlights the use of diatoms as ideal index fossils for tracking changes in lake conditions and the importance of studying ecophysiological characteristics of organisms to quantify the impact of acidification. The author also reviews the results of the Surface Water Acidification Project (SWAP) and the methods used to date recent sediments and calibrate diatom pH transfer functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
