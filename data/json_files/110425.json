He found that this species has a mode of reproduction similar to that of some reptiles and that it serves as a connecting link between oviparous and viviparous mammals. This research also confirmed the possibility of lactation coexisting with ovo-viviparous reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
