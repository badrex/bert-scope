They found that particle size, volatile matter, and oxygen enrichment significantly affect the ignition and quenching processes. A new formula was derived to explain these findings, which provides a better understanding of the ignition and quenching mechanisms and can be applied to complex fuels like coal. The results improve the prediction of quenching distance and minimum ignition energy, extending the accuracy to a wider range of experimental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion"}
