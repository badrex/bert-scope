The author proposes a grid model of auditory sensory memory (PAS II) that incorporates time and source channel dimensions. The model suggests that auditory input is represented as a rough spectrogram at specific time-channel intersections, and that lateral inhibition between these intersections plays a crucial role in memory and perception processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
