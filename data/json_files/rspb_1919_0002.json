They found that salts with lower surface tensions have a greater flocculating power. The study focused on sodium salts containing organic ions, which displayed wide variations in surface tension. The results showed a close relationship between surface tension and the ability to disperse colloidal particles, suggesting that surface tension plays a significant role in the flocculation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
