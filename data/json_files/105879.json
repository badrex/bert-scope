The improved barometer features a dial plate and updated wheel work, making it easier to track variations in the weight of the atmosphere. This instrument can be used to estimate the height of the atmosphere with greater precision than previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
