Four main cell types are identified, including generalized mesenchyme, dorsal longitudinal muscles, oral-field muscles, and subtrochal cells. Similar patterns of repeating elements are found in other echinoderm larvae, hemichordate tornaria larva, and chordates, suggesting a common underlying plan. The study provides insights into the evolution of chordate features and the possible antecedents of chordates."}
