They found that series methods can provide useful information about flow separation, but may be cumbersome for more complex geometries. The results were compared with finite difference solutions of the boundary layer equations and the full Navier-Stokes equations, showing that series and boundary-layer methods agree well but finite difference solutions do not always predict symmetric separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics > Internal Flow Separation"}
