He noticed that the fish's tail would drop off and eventually lead to its death. Arderon also discovered a fibrous substance on the fish's tail, which he studied using a microscope. He found that the fish's balance was affected when part of its tail was removed, demonstrating the delicate balance in fish anatomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ichthyology"}
