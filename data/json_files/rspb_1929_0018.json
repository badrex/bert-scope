They discovered these bodies play a crucial role in the formation of mature sperm cells. These post-nuclear bodies are present in various organisms, including molluscs, annelids, arthropods, and mammals, suggesting they are universal in flagellate spermatogenesis. The authors also examined the effect of X-rays on spermatogenesis and found that the post-nuclear bands are clearly visible in sperm cells treated with X-rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
