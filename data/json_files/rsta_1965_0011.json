It explores the existence of singularities at separation points and discusses the mathematical criteria for separation. The study includes examples of separation in various flow configurations, such as delta wings and geodesic ellipsoids, and examines the behavior of streamlines and skin friction in these scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
