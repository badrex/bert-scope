They present measurements for twenty-three cases over energy ranges of ~5 to ~40 keV (S1) and ~100 to ~3 keV (S2). The cross-sections do not conform to the simple adiabatic theory, but the size of the cross-section in the adiabatic region appears to depend on the reduced mass of the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
