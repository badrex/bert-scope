They calculated recombination coefficients for hydrogen, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and damp mixtures of gases, finding that recombination is greatly facilitated by the presence of even a small amount of water vapor. This research provides a more accurate understanding of the recombination process in molecular gases compared to previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
