They assigned almost 300 absorption lines and obtained new rotational, distortion, and spin-rotation parameters for the v1=1 level. The analysis also included a preliminary study of the Coriolis interaction through the inertial defect.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
