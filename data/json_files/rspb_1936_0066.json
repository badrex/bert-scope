They observe the formation of trivalents, the process of meiosis, and the role of chiasmata in chromosome pairing and segregation. The study provides insights into the external mechanics of chromosomes and the relationships between the forces working in mitosis and meiosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
