They used a cell with a hydrogen electrode and measured the e.m.f. to calculate the hydrogen-ion concentrations of buffer solutions of ammonia and ammonium chloride. The results showed that the dissociation constant of ammonia is approximately 4.75 at 25\u00b0C, and the temperature coefficients of the equilibrium constants were analyzed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical equilibrium"}
