Donovan, examines a newly discovered vegetable acid found in Sorbus Aucuparia berries and compares it to malic acid. They study the properties and crystal formations of these acids, discovering that the crystal formation from the new vegetable acid is different from that of malic acid. This research sheds light on the nature and combinations of acids in vegetables and their potential states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
