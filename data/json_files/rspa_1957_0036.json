They find that the non-equilibrium of the lattice leads to a first-order term in the thermo-electric power, which has a more complex temperature variation. This theory can account for the observed thermo-electric power of sodium at low temperatures and provides a possible explanation for some of the observed complexities in the thermo-electric effects in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
