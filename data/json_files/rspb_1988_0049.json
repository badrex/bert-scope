The experiments show that akinetes are more resistant to various physical, chemical, and biotic influences than vegetative cells. However, they are susceptible to desiccation and ultraviolet radiation. The research highlights the importance of mass production of akinetes in counteracting environmental hazards and maintaining the survival of the cyanobacterial population.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
