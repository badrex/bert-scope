They found that the phase shifts and cross-sections differ from semi-classical results, especially at energies below 0.1 eV. The study provides accurate data for 57 energy values ranging from 0.0001 to 10 eV, which can be used to improve our understanding of proton-hydrogen collisions and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
