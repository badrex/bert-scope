They found that a 16-volt electron can ionize hydrogen molecules without causing dissociation, while a higher voltage of about 20.2 volts may cause dissociation simultaneously with ionization. The results suggest that ionization of molecular hydrogen does not necessarily involve dissociation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ionization and Plasma Physics"}
