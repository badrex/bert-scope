They demonstrate that the red blood cells change shape when their volume increases, similar to a balloon-like structure, and not like a solid body. This study helps to understand the unique properties of erythrocytes and their role in the human body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
