They introduce convolutive multiplication, covariant differentiation, and intertwining, which produce tensors from strings and vice versa. The authors provide various statistical examples and compare strings to the concept of extensors. This work contributes to the understanding of strings and their applications in statistics and mathematics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
