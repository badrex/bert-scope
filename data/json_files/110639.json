Cooper observed that the red portion of the solar spectrum could be extended beyond its usual range when viewed through deep blue cobalt glass. He expressed a regret for not having enough time to further investigate this phenomenon. This finding could have implications for understanding color perception and solar spectrum analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
