The authors apply the theory of the preceding paper to these compounds and find that it provides a satisfactory explanation of the observed saturation moments and Curie temperatures. They also estimate the crystal field and exchange interaction to explain the moments and temperatures throughout the series.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
