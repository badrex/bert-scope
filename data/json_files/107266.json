They discovered that the shape and curvature of the surfaces in contact are responsible for the formation of these phenomena. The author also found that different surface curvatures produce various colored patterns, such as rings, streaks, and ellipses. This research helps to understand the underlying principles of prismatic appearances and the action of bodies and surfaces on light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
