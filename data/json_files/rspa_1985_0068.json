The simulation uses realistic potentials to predict properties of liquid isopentane and its glassy state. The research discusses radial distribution functions, dihedral angle distribution, and the glass transition, providing insights into the structure and behavior of isopentane glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
