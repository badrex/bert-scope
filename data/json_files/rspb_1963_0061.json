They discovered that the increase in respiration rate is linked to the activity of malic enzyme and carboxylase, which require energy from mitochondrial activity. The higher respiration rate in fruits at the climacteric peak is due to increased permeability of the pulp tissue, allowing a more rapid union between enzymes and substrates. After the climacteric peak, the respiration rate decreases as the activity of malic enzyme, carboxylase, and the mitochondrial system decreases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
