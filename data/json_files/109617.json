He discovered that Guaiacum is unique among resins due to its ability to form a more perfect resin, its high vegetable extract content, and its reaction with oxygen. This research helps to better understand the composition and properties of Guaiacum resin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic compounds"}
