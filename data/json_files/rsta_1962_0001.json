The research supports the Holmes-Houtermans model for interpreting lead isotope abundances, revealing six periods of mineralization in the British Isles, with the two most significant groups associated with the Caledonian and Hercynian orogenies. The findings also suggest that lead isotope abundance studies can be a valuable tool for determining the absolute age of mineral deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochronology"}
