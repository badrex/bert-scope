The authors describe a technique using a copper radiator to study the Compton secondaries and construct an efficiency curve for copper as a secondary radiator. They apply this method to the disintegrations of active isotopes Na24, Mn56, and Cl38 to determine the intensities and energies of y rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
