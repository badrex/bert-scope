They developed a new method to count particles in smokes using a cell with a limited observed volume, which allowed them to measure the velocity of coagulation. Their results showed a straight line when plotting the particulate volume against the age of the cloud, confirming Smoluchowski's theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal chemistry"}
