They develop a theory that identifies the critical conditions for ignition as the marginal loss of stability of the stationary-state reaction. This theory is applicable to all linear branched-chain systems and provides a simple criterion for ignition in open systems. The experimental results for an equimolar mixture of hydrogen and oxygen show good agreement with the theoretical predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
