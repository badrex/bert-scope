The author finds that the rate of change does not follow a linear function of time, and the mass action equation, when applied in the usual way, can lead to errors and misleading results. The author concludes that there is no evidence to support the idea that the action of dilute acids is analogous to that of an enzyme used in small proportions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
