The author introduces hedgehogs into areas with and without badgers, a larger member of the same guild, and observes differences in mortality and dispersal. The results show that badgers significantly impact hedgehog survival, suggesting that intraguild predation plays a crucial role in shaping community structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
