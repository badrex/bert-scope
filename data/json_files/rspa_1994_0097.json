New coefficient sets are obtained with up to 50% lower standard deviations. The study compares the geoid profile and oscillation in eccentricity with previous models, highlighting the importance of considering satellites in orbits close to the critical angle of inclination.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
