This function provides better fits to consistent sets of toughness data from metals and ceramics compared to the three-parameter Weibull distribution function. The new distribution function considers the inhomogeneity in the material and the dependence of yield stress and Young's modulus on temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
