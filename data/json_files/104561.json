Cooke, discusses the electrical phenomena observed in flannel and animal hair. He suggests that the sparkling of flannel and the conductivity of hair may be due to electrical properties. He also mentions that the electrical properties of hair and flannel can be affected by washing and wearing, as well as exposure to sea water. The author refers to similar experiments conducted by other researchers and suggests further investigation into these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
