They discuss the properties of the stream function in compressible flow and the behavior of the function in subsonic and supersonic regions. The authors also present asymptotic formulae for subsonic flow and analyze the second solution when the Mach number is an integer.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
