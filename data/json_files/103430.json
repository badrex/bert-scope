The author, Edward Naish, discusses the operation and dissection of the artery, highlighting the ossification as the cause of the mortification. He also speculates that such cases might be more common than realized, attributing some extremity mortifications in elderly patients to ossification.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Surgery"}
