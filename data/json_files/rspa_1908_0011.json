They discovered that the mode of vibration within the benzene nucleus is mostly unaffected by side-chain substitution. The study also revealed two types of absorption: general absorption, which is influenced by temperature, and selective absorption, which is best studied by reducing pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
