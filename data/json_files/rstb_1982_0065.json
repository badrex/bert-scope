It explores the consequences of plasmid instability and catalyst deactivation, and suggests strategies for stabilizing these cultures, such as using plasmids with temperature-dependent copy numbers, environmental pressure, and recombination-deficient strains. The article also presents mathematical models for predicting the behavior of mixed cultures in batch and continuous fermentation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
