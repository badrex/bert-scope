They develop a model that considers both steady-state and time-dependent conditions, and their findings help explain the behavior of impurities in the core region of dislocations. The research has implications for understanding strain aging and the mechanical properties of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Solid State Physics"}
