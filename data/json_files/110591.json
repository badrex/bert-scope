The author analyzes the works of Newton, Bessel, and others, and proposes a formula for the complete expression of the temperature of an atmosphere in equilibrium. The article compares the accuracy of different tables of mean refractions and suggests that improvements in our understanding of heat decrease in the atmosphere could lead to more accurate height measurements using the barometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
