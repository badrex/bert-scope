They found that the bacteria could not store nitrogen internally and continued to grow by using an alternative energy source, poly-\u03b2-hydroxybutyrate, after ammonia depletion in the culture medium. This discovery refutes the previous assumption that the bacteria stored nitrogen for future growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
