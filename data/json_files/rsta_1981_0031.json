The author emphasizes the importance of studying single crystals to obtain accurate results and highlights the challenges in measuring shielding tensors of protons in complex molecular structures. The article also explores the potential of multiple-pulse NMR in studying molecular motions in solids and the influence of intermolecular shielding contributions on proton shielding tensors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
