The biota includes diverse arthropods, annelids, and other organisms previously unrecorded from Silurian rocks. This discovery provides important information on the biology, evolution, and ecology of several taxa and contributes to our understanding of the true diversity of Silurian biotas and the factors that control their exceptional preservation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
