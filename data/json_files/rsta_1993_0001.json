The author emphasizes the connection between modally metasomatized rocks and dykes or veins indicative of melt injection. The study focuses on how the crystallization of metasomatic minerals is linked with the chemical evolution of melts injecting and percolating through peridotite, leading to the formation of continuous varieties of metasomatized rocks and melts.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
