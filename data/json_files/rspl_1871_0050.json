The authors found that when two metals are brought closer together, the electrical tension of the liquid increases, allowing zinc to combine with oxygen at the ordinary temperature. This discovery has practical applications in hydrogen production and the understanding of metal reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
