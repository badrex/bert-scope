Roget, invented a new instrument that uses logarithms to perform involution and evolution of numbers, making arithmetic calculations more efficient. The instrument is based on a unique method of employing logarithms and can be used to find products, quotients, and powers of numbers. This invention aimed to reduce the mental effort required for arithmetic calculations and improve the accuracy of mathematical operations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculating Instruments"}
