The current was activated by depolarizations to -50 mV or higher, had a peak current within 3-5 ms, and displayed voltage-dependent inactivation. The sodium channel responsible for this current was blocked by tetrodotoxin with a K0.5 of 8 nM and was resistant to block by lidocaine at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5M.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
