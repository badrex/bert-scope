They used two types of carbon membranes, Carbolac and Graphon, with different surface areas and properties. The study involved measuring equilibrium properties, isothermal transport, and thermo-osmotic transport of various gases. The results showed that the more homogeneous Graphon membrane had greater mobility of adsorbed molecules and better gas separation potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Membrane Science and Technology"}
