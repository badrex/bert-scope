They studied the critical pressure limits for decomposition and chemiluminescence, and how factors like temperature, surface area, and gas composition affect the process. The findings were used to understand the decomposition of nitrites and nitrates, providing information about the thermochemistry and reactivity of methoxy and ethoxy radicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermochemistry and Radical Reactions"}
