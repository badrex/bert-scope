The resonance employed is due to the hyperfine splitting of caesium, and the resonator is shown to be nearly independent of the parameters of the apparatus, making it a suitable standard for frequency and time measurement. The resonator has been used to calibrate quartz clocks and correlate atomic and astronomical time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
