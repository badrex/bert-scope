Encephalization is linked to the evolution of animal intelligence and is analyzed in various vertebrate species. The author argues that encephalization is the fundamental trait underlying intelligence and that further research should focus on understanding its implications rather than seeking additional neurological correlates of intelligence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior and Cognition"}
