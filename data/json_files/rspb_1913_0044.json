They discover that the presence of certain adsorbable substances can inhibit clot formation, but the addition of an appropriate enzyme can counteract this effect. The study provides insights into the milk clotting mechanism and the role of rennet in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
