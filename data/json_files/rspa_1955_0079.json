They found that increasing amounts of these gases increase the rate of decomposition up to a limit. The results suggest that the foreign gas acts on a part of the reaction that is independent of the chain-breaking inhibitor, supporting the belief that the residual reaction in the presence of sufficient inhibitor is one involving direct molecular decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
