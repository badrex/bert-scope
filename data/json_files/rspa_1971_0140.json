They determined the density, pressure, temperature, and sound speed within the blast waves by applying the Lagrangian conservation of mass equation and assuming adiabatic flow. This technique allowed them to describe all the properties of a blast wave based on experimental measurements alone, providing accurate results comparable to other forms of measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
