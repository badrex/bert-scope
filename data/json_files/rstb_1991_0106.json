The research finds that these fibrous foods are crucial for chimpanzees during periods of low fruit availability, providing essential nutrients and energy. The study also investigates how the intake of these fibrous foods is related to fruit abundance and rainfall, and whether they should be considered as substitutes or complements to fruits in the chimpanzees' diet.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
