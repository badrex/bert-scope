The authors use muon implantation modeling to study trap-dominated diffusion and the effects of carriers on hydrogen diffusion. They also discuss the potential role of muon studies in understanding high-energy states and the impact of hydrogen bonding on silicon properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
