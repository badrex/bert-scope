They found that reducing circulation capacity or injecting blood into the system increased all pressures and cardiac output, while increasing capacity or withdrawing blood had the opposite effect. The authors also discovered that the \"potential capacity increment\" of the arterial system plays a significant role in regulating blood pressure and cardiac output.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
