The effects of both homogeneous and heterogeneous reactions on the dispersion are studied under isothermal conditions. The results show that the effective Taylor diffusion coefficient decreases with an increase in the reaction rate constant for both types of reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
