They discovered that the rotatory power of quartz increases rapidly in the ultra-violet region, and they developed a new equation to represent the rotatory power of quartz throughout the visible, infra-red, and ultra-violet regions. The equation contains five independent constants, providing a more accurate representation of the rotatory dispersion of quartz.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
