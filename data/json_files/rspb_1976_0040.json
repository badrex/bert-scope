It found that both areas 17 and 18 project to the same small region in the posterior bank of the superior temporal sulcus, indicating an overlapping input from these areas. This suggests that both areas may contribute to the properties of cells in this cortical field, which are specialized for detecting motion in the visual field.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroanatomy"}
