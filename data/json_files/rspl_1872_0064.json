They find a correlation between the frequency and intensity of cyclones in the Southern Indian Ocean and the sunspot cycle. The study also reveals a periodicity in rainfall at various stations worldwide, with more rainfall during maximum sunspot years. This research suggests that sunspot cycles may have a significant impact on Earth's climate and weather patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
