The data is analyzed and presented, revealing a broad absorption feature at 212.4 nm and a discontinuity in the continuum intensity near 208.7 nm. The findings contribute to the understanding of the solar spectrum and the development of astronomical instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
