The authors review the results of embedded quantum cluster calculations, highlighting the similarities and differences between various exciton models in materials like alkali halides and oxides. They also describe the methods and computer codes used for these calculations, such as ICECAP and CLUSTER, which combine the unrestricted Hartree-Fock method with the Mott-Littleton approach to account for the polarization of the remaining crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
