It highlights the need to analyze protein systems that can modulate cell and tissue development, as well as those associated with DNA in the genetic material. The author emphasizes the significance of understanding these protein systems in relation to DNA and RNA sequences to define the cumulative processes of hominization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
