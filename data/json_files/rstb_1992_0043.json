They found that a conformational change in the protein complex controls the rate of GTP hydrolysis. This mechanism is affected by oncogenic mutations and the presence of GTPase activating proteins (GAPs). The findings provide insights into how the ratio of GTP and GDP in cells is controlled and how mutations can disrupt this regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
