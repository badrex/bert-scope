They found that the degree of preferred orientation depends on the clay's preparation method and its history of loading. The study also showed that flocculated and deflocculated suspensions have different initial structures, and the presence of organic matter can hinder the development of preferred orientation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Mechanics"}
