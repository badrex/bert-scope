He explains how pointed rods can prevent or conduct lightning, protecting buildings from damage. He also describes a real-life example of lightning striking a church steeple, where the lightning was conducted through a small wire and a clock pendulum without damaging the building.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
