They mapped out the various areas and their extents, and observed similarities and differences between the lemur's brain and those of other mammals, such as carnivores, ungulates, and apes. The study provides insights into the unique features of the lemur's brain, including its well-developed olfactory area, and its similarities to the brains of higher primates in some aspects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
