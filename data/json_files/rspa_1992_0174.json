The main effects in the dynamic case are the drastic reduction of the shakedown domain when external agencies' frequencies approach the structure's natural frequencies. The author provides a new simple proof of the second part of Koiter's theorem and discusses applications of both static and kinematic theorems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
