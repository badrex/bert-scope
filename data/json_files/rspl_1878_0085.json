Lauder Brunton and Sir Joseph Fayrer on the effectiveness of various substances in neutralizing cobra poison. They found that substances like perchloride of platinum, chloride of gold, and potassium permanganate can destroy the activity of cobra poison, but they are only chemical antidotes and do not prevent the venom's action after absorption into the blood. The researchers also found that some substances, like iron perchloride and carbolic acid, have less action on the poison and prolong life to a limited extent.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Toxicology"}
