The spider's large eyes help it capture prey in dim light by absorbing a large amount of light and having a high resolution. The eyes have a double-structured lens with a core that is likely inhomogeneous, similar to a fish lens, which contributes to their exceptional vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
