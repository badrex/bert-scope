They also study the behavior of explosive compounds when mixed with solids and liquids, and the influence of dilution on their susceptibility to detonation. The experiments demonstrate the importance of factors such as the nature of the explosive substance, the mechanical conditions, and the resistance offered by the materials used in detonation transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
