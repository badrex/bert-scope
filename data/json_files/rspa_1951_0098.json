They found that the semi-empirical valence bond method was successful in predicting bond energies, dipole moments, bond lengths, and force constants. The results also resolved the apparent contradiction between Pauling's adjacent charge rule and Gordy's rule connecting electronegativities and bond strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
