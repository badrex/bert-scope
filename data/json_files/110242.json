The method uses a Voltaic arrangement with zinc and platina, which deposits the metal in the form of crystals on the negative surface. This method can detect arsenic in very small amounts and outperforms other common tests in some cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
