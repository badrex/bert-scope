They found a barometer effect of around 10% per cm, which is larger than the effect of ordinary cosmic rays. The authors also concluded that the absorption of primaries in air is ten times larger than in lead, which can be explained by an exponential absorption model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
