They use soluble CD4 (sCD4) to study the interactions between CD4 and the HIV envelope glycoproteins, which lead to membrane fusion. The study reveals that sCD4 binding induces the dissociation of the gp120 and gp41 glycoprotein subunits, exposing the gp41 fusion peptide and facilitating virus-cell membrane fusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
