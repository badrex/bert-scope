The patterns of air flow in and out of the lungs were measured using a flow transducer attached to a mask. The study found that while there were differences in the rate and depth of pulmonary ventilation among species, the overall patterns of air flow were similar. The study also discovered a double phase during expiration in adult donkeys, mules, and horses, which was not observed in young animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
