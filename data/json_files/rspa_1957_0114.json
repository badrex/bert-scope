They find that the model is valid as a first approximation but that deviations are significant, especially for ions with high charge and small radius. The authors apply modern theories of the dielectric constant of water to provide a higher-approximation treatment, improving the interpretation of experimental free energies and entropies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
