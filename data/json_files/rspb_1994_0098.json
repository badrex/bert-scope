The results show that the infarcted cortex had strong connections with some visual areas and weaker connections with others. The density of connections varied within some areas, possibly related to retinotopic organization. This research provides insights into the complex connections and organization of the human visual system.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Neuroscience"}
