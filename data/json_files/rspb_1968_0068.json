This process occurs in sheltered bays on the Pacific sandy shoreline of Auckland, New Zealand, where fragments split off from the hind end of the anterior half of a worm that has already broken in two. The small fragments, called regenerands, possess all structures present in the parent body from which they split. This finding expands our understanding of asexual reproduction in protochordates and suggests that this phenomenon may be common in other ptychoderid populations worldwide.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protochordates"}
