He suggests that the two impressions from each eye are not perceived simultaneously, but rather one dominates over the other. He proposes that there are compartments in the retina with specific limits, and this hypothesis, combined with the principle of dominance, helps explain the related phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
