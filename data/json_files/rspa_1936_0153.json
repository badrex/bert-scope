They identified three radioactive bodies, Al28, Si27, and Al29, and analyzed the decay curves and cross-sections for activation of these isotopes. The results showed significant differences in the integrated cross-sections for the isotopes, highlighting the importance of studying the behavior of isotopes under alpha particle bombardment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
