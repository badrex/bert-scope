They observed the reduction of the carbonyl group and exchange of methyl groups on films of various metals. The study aimed to elucidate the mechanisms of reduction and exchange reactions and determine the efficiency of different metals for the exchange of acetone. The results provide insights into the catalytic properties of metal films and the factors affecting the efficiency of exchange reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
