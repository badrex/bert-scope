The researchers analyzed trace metals, primary nutrients, dissolved and particulate organic matter, and thermal changes in the water. They found that while some metals and nutrients were higher in concentration inside the estuary, overall, the water did not show signs of gross pollution. The study also highlighted the importance of considering factors such as particulate matter and sediment levels in pollution studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Estuarine Ecology"}
