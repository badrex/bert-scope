He discovered that pearls are composed of various salts that can be separated through heat and that these salts coagulate in different forms. The author concludes that pearls are not useful for medicinal purposes and have no significant value beyond their aesthetic appeal.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Mineral Composition"}
