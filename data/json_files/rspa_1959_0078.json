The researchers used an indentation test to analyze the effect of crack orientation and depth on the fracture load. They found that smaller cracks are more abundant but do not significantly affect the indentation strength, while larger cracks have a more significant impact. The study provides insights into understanding the behavior of glass surfaces and improving their mechanical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
