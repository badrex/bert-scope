They confirmed the prediction of anomalous dispersion and provided evidence for mode degeneracy in disparate mass gas mixtures, which occurs when the acoustic mode becomes degenerate with another longitudinal hydrodynamic mode at critical values of frequency and composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
