They find that Palaeodiscus has a more primitive and ancestral structure than previously thought, with unique features such as a double series of plates in the ambulacra and a different arrangement of interambulacral plates. This research contributes to the understanding of the evolution and relationships within the Echinoid group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinodermata"}
