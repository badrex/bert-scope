The author explores the various synthetic opportunities and applications of living polymers, such as the preparation of polymers of uniform molecular weight, block polymers, star-shaped and comb-shaped polymers, and polymers with functional end-groups. The article also highlights the importance of electron transfer reactions in the formation of living polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
