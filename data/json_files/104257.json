They discovered that packthread and cat-gut were effective conductors, while sealing wax and dry sheep-skin were not. The experiments also demonstrated the importance of moisture in the conductivity of certain materials and the limitations of distance and weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
