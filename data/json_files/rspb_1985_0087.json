The authors predict the complete amino acid sequence of the EGF receptor and describe the production of polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies to study its structure and function. The EGF receptor plays a role in normal and malignant cell growth, and understanding its structure can help in cancer research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
