They used X-ray data and the rotating crystal method to analyze the minerals' structures. The chondrodite group is interesting because it demonstrates morphotropy and is based on the hexagonal form of the two possible close-packed arrangements of oxygen atoms. The Mg2Si04 portion of the crystals has the olivine structure, which is significant as it shows the incorporation of a known structure within a more complex structure. This finding could have implications for understanding other complex silicates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
