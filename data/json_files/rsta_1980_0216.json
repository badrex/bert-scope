The study assesses the scale, timing, and development of mantle heterogeneity and suggests that it existed at 3 billion years ago and was well established by 2 billion years ago. The research also provides evidence for progressive development of variability in Sr isotope ratios in the mantle source regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
