They introduce a new method of notation using generalizations of elementary algebraic signs and discuss the significance of this notation in various cases. The author also explains the difference between lateral and longitudinal translation and how it affects the product of the translated magnitude and the amount of translation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Symbolic Algebra"}
