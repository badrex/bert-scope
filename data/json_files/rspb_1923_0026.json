It reveals that root meristem walls contain a higher proportion of protein and fatty acids, while stem meristem walls have more cellulose and pectic substances. These differences affect the diffusion of water-soluble solutes through the meristem wall, contributing to the distinct growth patterns of roots and stems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
