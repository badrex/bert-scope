They used extracellular staining through a stimulating electrode to visualize the neurons and found that primary sensory fibers, particularly those in the dorsal tegumentary nerve, were often stained. The results provide insights into the structural substrate that transmits signals for walking between the head ganglia and the thorax.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
