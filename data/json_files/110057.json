He found that the free acid present is muriatic acid, and the salts are alkaline muriates. Prout also concluded that unsaturated muriatic acid exists in stomachs during digestion and performs the same function in the human stomach.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
