They discovered that there is a delayed production of heat after a short tetanus applied to a muscle in nitrogen. The amount of delayed anaerobic heat varies, and the explanation for this phenomenon remains unclear. This research contributes to the understanding of muscle physiology and anaerobic metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
