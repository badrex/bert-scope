The nephridia form a network of tubules connected between segments, which is similar to the excretory system of some Platyhelminths. This discovery supports the idea that Annelida can be derived from the Platyhelminth excretory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Annelida"}
