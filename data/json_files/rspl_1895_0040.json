They found that croton-resin is responsible for the vesicating property of croton oil and has a complicated constitution, possibly being a lactone or anhydride. The resin is nearly insoluble in water and some organic solvents but dissolves in alcohol, ether, and chloroform.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
