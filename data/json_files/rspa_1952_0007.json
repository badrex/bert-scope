The authors develop a theory based on Onsager's treatment of irreversible processes, which leads to equations for the rate of permeation and the pressure ratio at the stationary state. The effect of thermo-osmosis depends on the sum of the heat of solution and the heat of transport within the membrane.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
