The stones were analyzed and found to be composed of earth, volatile alkaline salts, water, oil, and a small amount of air. These stones resemble bezoar stones and have a specific gravity similar to hartshorn. The stones were also found to have a small piece of iron nail inside. The analysis suggests that these stones may be formed from ingested foreign materials such as straw and small sticks.", "scientific_discipline": "Veterinary Medicine > Animal Health"}
