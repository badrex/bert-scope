The author examines the transmission and reflection spectra of various opals, discovering that they emit light due to interference caused by minute striae or fissures within the gemstones. The author also explains how these opals can be used in spectroscopy and how their unique properties can be observed and studied.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
