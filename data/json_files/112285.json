It presents a further development of the theory of skew surfaces and considers various types of scrolls, such as S(m, n, p), S(m2, n), and S(m3). The author also discusses singularities in the system of curves and introduces a new kind of singularity in a curve in space.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
