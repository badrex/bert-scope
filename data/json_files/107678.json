He discovered an anomalous behavior where iron exhibits negative attraction to the compass needle at the red heat before transitioning to positive attraction at the white heat. This finding helps to reconcile previous contradictory statements about the magnetic properties of heated iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
