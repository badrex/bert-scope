They observe a gradation in these fluids and their containing systems in the animal series, which helps explain digestion, sanguification, and respiration processes in invertebrates. This research also suggests new ways to understand the circulation and nutrient fluids in lower classes of invertebrate animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
