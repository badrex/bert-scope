The author examines the heat transfer from a sphere and a wire, and finds that the heat loss is the same as that by conduction to a certain surrounding surface maintained at ambient temperature. The study provides qualitative deductions about the heat transfer and estimates the limits of validity for the two extreme solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
