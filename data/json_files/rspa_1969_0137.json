The experiment used ionization chambers to detect molecular oxygen, which has a strong absorption at a wavelength of about 145 nm. The data collected during the first 10 days of operation showed a large and systematic variation with longitude, providing valuable insights into the thermosphere's molecular oxygen distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
