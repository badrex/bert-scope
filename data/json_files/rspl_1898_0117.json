They discover that reflected cathode rays, now known as electrons, have a negative charge and can cause green fluorescence of glass. The author also explores the potential mechanical force exerted by reflected cathode rays and examines the reflection of cathode rays using a spherically concave reflector.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
