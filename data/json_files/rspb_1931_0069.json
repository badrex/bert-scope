They found that glutathione is oxidized during aerobic survival respiration, and its oxidation is associated with a continuation of reduction processes, indicating its metabolic significance. This research demonstrates that glutathione plays a crucial role in maintaining the transport of hydrogen to oxygen in cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
