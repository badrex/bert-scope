They discuss the main steps in the Wahlquist-Estabrook prolongation procedure and provide a framework for solving the problems of the second step. The algorithm is demonstrated with several examples of scalar and system quasi-polynomial flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
