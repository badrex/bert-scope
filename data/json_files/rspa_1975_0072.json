Ag-Zn Alloys", "semantic_tags": ["Fermi surface", "h.c.p. phase", "Ag-Zn alloys", "Low temperature specific heats", "Band structure"], "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics", "tldr": "The authors conducted experiments on Ag-Zn alloys in the h.c.p. phase to study the Fermi surface overlap effect using low temperature specific heats. They found that the electronic specific heat coefficient is consistent with a nearly rigid band behavior, showing a decrease in the density of states at the Fermi level when the corners of the Brillouin zone are filled. The results confirm a theoretical model involving overlaps of electrons across the {00.2} planes of the Brillouin zone."}
