The author presents experiments and observations on the effects of temperature and strain on the properties of iron and steel wires. The study reveals that different types of iron and steel exhibit various behaviors during heating and cooling, and the molecular changes involve a combination of expansion and contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
