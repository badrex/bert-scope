The research shows that the stimulation-induced changes in muscle properties are completely reversible, with muscles recovering their original fast properties within 12 weeks after stopping stimulation. The study provides insights into the time-course of reversion and the changes in physiological, histochemical, and biochemical properties during the slow-to-fast transformation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
