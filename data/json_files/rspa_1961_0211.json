The authors evaluate the spin-lattice interaction in terms of a few constants and investigate one- and two-phonon processes. They compute relaxation times for non-Kramers and Kramers salts and apply the general theory to holmium and dysprosium ethyl sulfate. The study shows that a resonance process, analogous to the resonance radiation effect in gases, dominates the relaxation process in rare-earth salts, leading to a relaxation time proportional to the inverse of the temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
