They discovered that these vortex structures are linked to bursting events and are present in both types of walls. The measurements indicate that the scale of the near-wall vortex structures is directly proportional to the size of the boundary roughness elements under fully rough conditions. The findings have implications for environmental impact assessment and engineering design.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
