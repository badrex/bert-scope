This method eliminates errors caused by atmospheric, actinic, or chemical changes, and personal bias, allowing for more accurate study of stellar variability. The authors provide an example using the region of the great nebula in Orion, demonstrating that at least ten stars within a small area had changed significantly in brightness over a short interval of five days.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophotography"}
