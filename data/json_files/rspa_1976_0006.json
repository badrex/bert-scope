They assume that candidates can be located in an attribute space, and voters have an ideal point in that space. The method uses a multivariate normal distribution of ideal points and assumes that indifference surfaces for each voter are ellipsoids centered at their ideal points. The collective ordering is determined by the distances of candidate representative points from the mode of the distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Social Choice Theory"}
