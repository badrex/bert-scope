Wind dispersal is found to be the most wasteful, while animal-assisted dispersal is more selective and efficient. The author also highlights the importance of considering the reproductive capacity and habitat requirements of a species when evaluating the effectiveness of dispersal methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
