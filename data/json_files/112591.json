They discovered that this substance, called \"animal quinoidine,\" is identical to the fluorescent substance in human lenses. The study also found that quinine can be detected in the urine within 15 minutes of ingestion and reaches its maximum concentration in three hours. It starts to decrease after eight hours and is undetectable after 72 hours.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
