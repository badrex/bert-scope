He examines the motion of trains on level and inclined planes, the effect of friction, and the impact of changes in speed. Lardner also explores the impact of the ground-plan of the road and the pressure produced by a given velocity and load. Lastly, he discusses the estimation of the mechanical power needed to work a railway.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Transportation"}
