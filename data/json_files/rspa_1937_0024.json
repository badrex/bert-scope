They discovered that the addition of secondary energy, such as heat, can render methane-air mixtures capable of maintaining a quasi-detonation, which is not true detonation. The study provides insights into the ignition of methane-air mixtures by mining explosives and the propagation of flame in these mixtures ignited by sources of varying intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
