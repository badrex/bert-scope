They find that long-range gravitational forces are necessarily attractive, while very short-range forces must be repulsive. The theory differs from general relativity in its treatment of strong gravitational fields and offers new insights into the ratio of gravitational to electrical forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
