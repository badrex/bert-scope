The author examines the acid-catalyzed and enzyme-catalyzed hydrolysis of glycosides, focusing on the role of nucleophilic substitution and the formation of carbonium ions. The study also compares the mechanisms of hydrolysis in glucose and mannose systems, highlighting the differences in their stereochemistry and reactivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
