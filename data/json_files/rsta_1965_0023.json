The author highlights the need for more extensive geological mapping and the use of seismic fault-plane solutions to better understand the prevalence and significance of these faults. The article also emphasizes the unique physiographic features of transcurrent faults, such as linear fractures, offset stream courses, and rift topography, which can help identify and map these faults.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
