The model includes photosystems II and I, plastoquinone, and NADP as electron acceptors, and explains how the balance of excitation rates prevents over-reduction or over-energization of the electron transport chain. The model also suggests a possible mechanism for light and shade tolerance in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
