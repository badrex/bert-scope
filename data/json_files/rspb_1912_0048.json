They found that the percentage of infected individuals produced among flies fed during periods when the blood is infective gives an index of the virulence of the strain as regards the fly. The author also discovered that the trypanosome strain plays a significant role in limiting the number of infected glossina, while the fly's individual idiosyncrasies have less impact.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
