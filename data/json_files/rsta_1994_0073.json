The authors introduce two tissue interaction models and examine the bifurcations from simple to complex patterns. They demonstrate that tissue interaction is essential for understanding the complexity of spatial structure and the sequential patterning in skin development. The models consider different types of interaction between the dermis and epidermis, including chemical, mechanical, and electrical signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
