They analyzed the kinetics of hydrogen atom decay in a gas-flow system and determined the absolute concentrations of hydrogen atoms. The study provided reliable values for the rate constants of the decay processes, including the second-order gas-phase recombination reaction and the first-order surface recombination reaction. No evidence was found for the presence of a third-order gas-phase recombination reaction."}
