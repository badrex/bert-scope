They find that insolation is greatly dependent on relative humidity, with coastal areas generally having higher insolation than interior regions. The author also compares insolation in mountain climates of Sikkim and Ladak, showing a connection between the presence of aqueous vapor and insolation. This connection is explained by considering the effects of radiation from the sun and the surrounding air.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
