Montgomery, observed the expansion and transformation of organic cells, particularly cancerous cells, when exposed to water. They discovered that cells are made of a uniformly viscous material that swells and forms globules upon imbibition. This process explains the formation of various cell-like structures in tissues, blood, and other bodily fluids. The author also identified myelin as the substance responsible for forming globules of a definite size, which contributes to the development of cells. This research challenges the traditional cell theory and suggests that cells are a physical result of chemical changes rather than the manifestation of vital forces."}
