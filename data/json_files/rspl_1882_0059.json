They propose that the heated wire heats the air around it, creating a difference in density that causes a current of clean air to flow through the dusty air. This results in a dark band of air rising from the wire, which the author explains through fluid dynamics and gas flow principles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
