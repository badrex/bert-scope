The exopodites beat with a modified rowing action, following elliptical paths that facilitate an overlapping sequence of movement. The beating occurs within a restricted range of frequencies around 4 Hz, and each beat cycle consists of a powerstroke, returnstroke, and pause. The results provide insights into the properties of metachronal rhythms and contribute to understanding the neural coordination of cyclical activities in arthropods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
