It focuses on nearby clouds and a Monte-Carlo analysis of general clouds. The authors compare their findings with previous experiments and discuss the possibility of stellar winds causing gamma-rays. They present evidence against this idea using the Orion nebula and the Gum nebula.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
