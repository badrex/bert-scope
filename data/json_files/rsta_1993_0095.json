It explores the different types of liquid crystal phases, such as nematic, smectic, and columnar, and how they form based on the concentration and structure of the aggregates. The article also explains the role of alcohol and salt in modifying the stability of different micelle structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
