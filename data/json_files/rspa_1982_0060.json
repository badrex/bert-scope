They consider transversality to strata of corank 2 and 1 of codimension 2. The key idea is to reduce the problem to studying the contact of a quadric of revolution with the mirror. The results show that certain types of mirrors, such as those with bad umbilics or surfaces of revolution, provide counterexamples to source genericity.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
