The research shows that these potentials are produced by the spontaneous release of inhibitory transmitter at synapses on motoneurons, and they can be detected by increasing the intracellular concentration of Cl-. The findings provide new insights into the functioning of the mammalian nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
