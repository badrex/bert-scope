This new approximation is introduced into the Born-Green integral equation for the radial distribution function and is applied to the ideal case of a gas of rigid spheres. The results show that the new approximation is more accurate and consistent compared to previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
