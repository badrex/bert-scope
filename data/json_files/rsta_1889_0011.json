They used a telescope and a photometric box to compare the intensity of the coronal light with a glow lamp. The results showed that the light of the corona was apparently equal to 0.42 of a standard candle at a distance of 1 foot. This study helped improve the understanding of the intensity and color of the coronal light during solar eclipses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
