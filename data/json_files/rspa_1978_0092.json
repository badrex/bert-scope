The solution uses a modification of the Wiener-Hopf technique and is suitable for numerical computations. The study focuses on the attenuation of sound in finite closed ducts and the radiation of sound from ducts that terminate, which is important for reducing noise from modern jet engines and designing suitable screening to deflect the radiated sound from sensitive areas of population.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Acoustics"}
