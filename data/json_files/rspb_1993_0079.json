The results show that cell shortening is increased in the hypertrophy group, and the relation between cell shortening and membrane voltage is bell-shaped. The findings suggest that increased calcium entry via sarcolemmal sodium-calcium exchange may contribute to the differences in contraction in hypertrophy myocytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
