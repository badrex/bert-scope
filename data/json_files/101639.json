Leibnitz describes his invention of a new principle for making precise portable watches. Instead of relying on equal vibrations of pendulums or springs, his method is based on a mechanical reflection that ensures uniform play between two springs. This innovation allows for more accurate timekeeping and eliminates the need for a fusee and string or chain. The article also addresses potential objections and offers solutions for using these watches in challenging environments, such as at sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Watchmaking"}
