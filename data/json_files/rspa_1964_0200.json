The authors present a method for analyzing the ion mass spectrometer data and report on the relative concentrations of various ion species. The study provides a global picture of the ionosphere and contributes to the understanding of the upper atmosphere's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Physics"}
