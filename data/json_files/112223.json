The author proposes using synthermal lines to represent places with the same temperature at a specific time, and presents tables and maps to demonstrate the distribution of these lines. The author also explores the relationship between synthermal lines and soil temperature, as well as the connection to wind force.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
