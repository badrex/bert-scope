They describe the efferent and afferent branchial arteries, the formation of arterial loops, and the role of epibranchial arteries in the development of the dorsal aorta. This research contributes to the study of the evolution of vascular systems in vertebrates and sheds light on the anatomy of fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
