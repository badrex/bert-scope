He discovered that when heat was applied, there was a change in the force of gravitation, and the action was not due to air currents or any other known force. The experiments showed that when the vacuum was close to absolute, the neutral point was reached, and the action of heat changed from attraction to repulsion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
