The authors discuss the environmental factors, such as solar radiation, atmospheric composition, and water availability, that influenced the development of these organisms. They also examine the physiological adaptations, like internalization of gas-exchange surfaces and hydrostatic skeletons, that allowed these organisms to thrive in their new environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant and Arthropod Evolution"}
