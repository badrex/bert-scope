The model reveals large-amplitude structure in the topmost 400 km and the lowermost 500 km of the mantle, with the middle of the mantle characterized by low-amplitude anomalies. The study supports the idea that an endothermic phase transition is not a barrier to large-scale flow in the mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
