The authors describe the instruments used to measure electron density and temperature, and explain the techniques employed to overcome challenges such as varying spacecraft potential and poor signal-to-noise ratios. The experiments provide valuable data on electron density and temperature, which can help improve our understanding of the ionosphere and its interactions with the Earth's atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
