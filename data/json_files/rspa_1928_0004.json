They study the properties of these systems, such as degradation to the red, similar ratios of wave-numbers, and perturbations of low vibrational energy levels. The authors conclude that these systems share common electronic transitions and are likely analogues of each other.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
