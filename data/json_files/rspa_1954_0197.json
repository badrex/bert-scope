The authors determine the transport spectrum and eddy conductivity, providing insights into the macroscopic consequences and mean amplitudes of turbulent fluctuations. The study contributes to understanding thermal turbulence and its role in geophysical and astrophysical convection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
