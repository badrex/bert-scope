The authors found that reactions which are second-order in radical concentration dominate in this intensity region, and no evidence was found of any reaction of radicals with the parent molecule. The results provide insights into the primary photochemical acts and secondary reactions of free radicals in high-intensity photolysis systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
