The gas was extracted by treating the minerals with dilute sulfuric acid or fusing with sodium carbonate. The discovery of helium in these minerals expanded the understanding of the composition of the Earth's crust and the presence of noble gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
