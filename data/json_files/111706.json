They compared the properties of these compounds with those produced by the indirect method and found similarities. The author also observed differences in the crystalline forms of the compounds. Further experiments are needed to determine the relationship between the two types of bromphenylamines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
