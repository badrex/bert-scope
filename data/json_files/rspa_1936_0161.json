The environments of the waters in this crystal are of interest. The unit cell contains four molecules of 3CdSO4\u00b78H2O, and the structure is defined by 38 parameters. The agreement between calculated and observed F values is shown in a table, indicating a correct structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
