They discovered that the teeth consist of dentine and are often coated with enamel, which was previously thought to be cementum. The tooth-germ formation in ophidia is different from other animals, with a large number of teeth forming in a specific arrangement to accommodate the snake's expandable mouth. This research provides a better understanding of reptile teeth structure and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Reptile Biology"}
