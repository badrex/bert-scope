The study demonstrates that the medium contributes to the sphere's inertia, and the electric force is responsible for the mechanical forces acting on the sphere. The findings have implications for understanding electrical inertia and the behavior of charged particles in electric fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
