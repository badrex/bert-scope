They found that different colors of light have varying effects on plant processes, such as the decomposition of carbonic acid and the evolution of oxygen. The author also discovered that plants can help purify the air by releasing oxygen and absorbing carbon dioxide, which is essential for their growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
