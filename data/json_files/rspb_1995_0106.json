The authors demonstrate that spatial constraints can favor honest signaling even without costs, leading to the coexistence of \"islands\" of honesty in a sea of dishonesty. The extent to which honest or dishonest strategies are favored depends on the relative payoffs from signaling and receiving.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
