Singularities in this expansion are connected to phase transitions, and the limits of solubility and specific heat can be obtained. The study focuses on a binary solution with a two-phase region, providing insights into the free energy and thermal energy for any atomic fraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
