They find that the amount of poison ejected by sea-snakes is much smaller than that of cobras, and the symptoms produced by sea-snake poison are similar to those caused by cobra venom, with the exception of no appreciable action on the blood. The author also analyzes the process of poison formation and its effects on various animals, as well as its post-mortem findings."}
