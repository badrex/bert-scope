They found that there is no fixed relation between the oxygen absorbed under exercise and the corresponding heat emitted, but the mean for each person somewhat approximates a constant figure. The author also discovered that there is a marked excess of heat over normal given out under exercise, and the efficiency of oxygen utilization varies between individuals. This research helps to understand the relationship between energy production and human physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
