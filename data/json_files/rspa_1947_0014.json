They discovered that these crystals undergo a phase transition, changing from a single crystal to a hybrid crystal composed of subcrystalline units. This transition occurs continuously over a range of temperatures, providing new insights into the thermodynamics of crystals and their phase changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
