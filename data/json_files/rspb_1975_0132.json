ABA, a naturally occurring growth hormone inhibitor, protects plants from various types of physiological stress. Xanthoxin, another potent growth inhibitor, has been characterized and may play a role in the hormonal control of plant growth. The article also reviews the mode of action of synthetic growth retardants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
