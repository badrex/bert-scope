They found that coupling both models created problems due to inconsistent fields, but applying a flux correction helped balance the mean biases and reduce the climate drift. The model's initial data and results provide valuable insights into climate studies and greenhouse effect simulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
