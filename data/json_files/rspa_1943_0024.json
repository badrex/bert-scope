The authors demonstrate the importance of boundary layer flow and test a hydrodynamical theory by O.G. Sutton. The theory predicts the absolute rate of turbulent transfer in a satisfactory manner, and the results show a marked rise in the rate of evaporation at a wind speed that depends on the position of the evaporating strip on the glass plate. The authors suggest that the turbulent flow over the evaporating surface is essential for understanding the evaporation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
