The authors used Kundt's method to determine the adiabatic elasticity and temperature, while keeping the volume constant. They found a linear relation between adiabatic elasticity and temperature, which enabled them to draw adiabatic curves for the substance. This is the first time adiabatic curves have been obtained for any substance except perfect gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
