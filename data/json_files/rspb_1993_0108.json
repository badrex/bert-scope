The results show that endogenous glucocorticoids help ameliorate the induction of nitric oxide synthase and cyclooxygenase in response to inflammatory stimuli such as cytokines or endotoxin, thus reducing the severity of circulatory shock.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
