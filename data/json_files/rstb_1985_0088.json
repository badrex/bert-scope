It challenges the traditional view that the transition from fish to tetrapods occurred in a freshwater environment and proposes a new model suggesting that the ancestors of tetrapods had a basic marine origin. The study also reevaluates the geological and physiological evidence to better understand the environment in which these adaptations evolved.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
