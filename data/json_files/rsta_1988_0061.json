They identify key processes such as evaporation, recondensation, aggregation, compaction, heating events, and metasomatic exchange reactions. This model helps explain the chemical fractionations observed in meteoritic constituents and provides a unifying framework for understanding the origin and evolution of the solar system.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteoritics and Planetary Science"}
