It shows that after denervation, sodium channels are built into discrete areas of the slow fiber membrane, and the process depends on the amount of denervation in individual fibers. The results suggest that action potential mechanisms develop in spots or patches, leading to areas of the slow fiber membrane transforming at various rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
