The authors develop a nonlinear age-structured model to analyze population dynamics and conclude that temperature-dependent sex determination provides a compromise that maintains an unbalanced sex ratio while offering the advantages of sexual reproduction. The model reflects the selective advantages of environmental determination over genetic sex and highlights the importance of temperature in controlling growth, development, and survival of crocodilians.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
