They identified 3-indolylacetic acid (IAA), 3-indole-carboxylic acid (IGA), and 3-indolyl-acetonitrile (IAN) in both crown-gall and normal stem tissue extracts. The high auxin levels in crown-gall tissue could be due to differences in auxin production, conversion, or destruction between normal and crown-gall cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
