The authors demonstrate the application of this method in frog muscle, rat heart, and yeast cells, providing unidirectional rate constants for metabolic processes. The technique offers a non-invasive way to study metabolism and provides valuable constraints for modeling high-energy phosphate flow in living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
