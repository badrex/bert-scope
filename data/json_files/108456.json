They find that albumen, fibrin, blood-globules, and alkaline salts can be present in the urine before food intake and can be influenced by rest or motion. The author disproves the idea that a disease causes fat accumulation in the blood, which is then excreted by the kidneys. Instead, they suggest that other factors, such as diet and physical activity, may affect the composition of chylous urine.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Nephrology and Urology"}
