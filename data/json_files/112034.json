The unexpected results showed that the reaction produced chlorides of monatomic radicals with the same number of carbon atoms as the original hydrocarbon. This discovery led to the possibility of synthesizing various compounds, including alcohols, acids, compound ammonias, and ethers, using methyl as the starting point.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
