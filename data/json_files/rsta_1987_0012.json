The study suggests that exceptionally high thermal gradients existed within the upper crust, with temperatures as high as 700\u00b0C attained at depths as shallow as 10 km, resulting in large-scale crustal anatexis. The tectonic setting best suited to explain the metamorphic phenomena in the Hercynian of the Pyrenees is that of rifted continental crust, with a transient, high-temperature heat source in the lower crust required to account for the observed metamorphic arrays.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Tectonics and Structural Geology"}
