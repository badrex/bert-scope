They analyzed the fine structure of the bands and used intensity as a guide to assign the bands to suitable vibrations. This work provides valuable data for understanding the structure and behavior of polyatomic molecules, contributing to the field of molecular spectroscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
