G. Stokes, presents a preliminary notice on the law of extraordinary refraction in Iceland spar. He conducted experiments to examine the law of refraction and found that the result disproves the theory that makes double refraction depend on a difference of inertia in different directions. This study contributes to the understanding of crystallography and optics."}
