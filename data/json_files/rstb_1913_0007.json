They discovered that certain environmental changes, such as high temperatures, can cause physical changes in the offspring that persist even after returning to normal conditions. This research sheds light on the concept of parallel induction and the potential for environmental factors to influence the development and characteristics of future generations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
