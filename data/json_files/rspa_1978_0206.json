The authors propose a modification to the ICR method that eliminates uncertainties in the method and allows for the measurement of reaction rate constants. They discuss the experimental conditions and limitations of the technique, and provide suggestions for future improvements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
