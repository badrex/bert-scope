The author confirms Wood's observations and reports crystal structure analyses for three of the four polymorphs. The deformation is due to progressive gliding of lattice planes, and the deformations are topotaxic, meaning that the layer arrangement is preserved but not the complete three-dimensional orientation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
