He conducts a series of experiments to determine the composition of the ore and the properties of the molybdate. The ore is found to be composed of lead oxide and molybdic acid, making it a unique mineralogical discovery. The molybdenum compound can exist in different forms, such as crystalline, white powder, or citron-colored oxide, each with distinct solubility properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
