It demonstrates that a finitely generated group can be embedded in a finitely presented group if and only if it has a recursively enumerable set of defining relations. This theorem offers a better understanding of the relationship between recursively presented groups and finitely presented groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
