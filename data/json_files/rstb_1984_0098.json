The authors describe the differences between the C4A and C4B genes, their polymorphisms, and how these variations affect the efficiency of covalent binding between C4 and immune complexes. The study also provides insights into the complete nucleotide sequence of a C4A mRNA and a partial sequence of a C4B mRNA, which can be used to synthesize nucleotide probes specific for C4A and C4B.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
