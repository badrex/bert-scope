They developed a quasi-equilibrium statistical theory to calculate the rate coefficient, taking into account the orbital angular momentum of the associating pair. The theory predicts a rate coefficient that is in good agreement with experimental measurements, indicating the importance of considering orbital angular momentum in these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
