They used a Lenard tube to create a source of ionization and studied the reaction at different pressures. The results showed that the decomposition of ammonia by cathode rays was in agreement with previous findings using other sources of ionization. The study aimed to determine the energy of the electrons and the number of electron-volts per molecule reacting to calculate the M/N ratio for the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
