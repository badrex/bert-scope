Gore, conducted experiments to study the effects of different positive metals on the changes of potential in voltaic couples. The results showed that the proportion of dissolved substances required to change the potential varied with each different positive or negative metal. The more positive or easily corroded the positive metal, or the more negative and less easily corroded the negative one, the smaller the proportion of dissolved substance needed to change the potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
