They found that the decomposition is a first-order reaction and compared it with the decomposition of other alkyl nitrites to understand the effect of chemical configuration on the reaction kinetics and the strength of the ruptured bond. The results showed that the activation energies and rates of decomposition for both straight-chain and branched-chain isomers were similar, indicating that the reaction is independent of the arrangement of atoms."}
