The author examines the effect of gravity on the planet's stability and potential energy, considering the points of bifurcation where the gravitational potential outweighs the increase in potential energy of elastic forces. The study also explores the principal vibrations and frequency equations of a spherically symmetrical solid, with implications for understanding the vibrations of natural, non-homogeneous bodies like the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
