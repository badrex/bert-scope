They discovered that appropriate excitation of afferent nerves from the flexor muscles alters the condition of the extensor muscles, affecting the knee jerk reflex. The experiments suggest that the change in the extensor muscles is in the direction of increased tonicity, supporting the idea that the interference with the \"jerk\" is located in the spinal mechanism of the reflex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
