It explores the different sources of pollutants, including sea water, suspended particles, sediments, and food chains. The article also examines the biological, chemical, and environmental factors that influence the rate of accumulation and the ultimate levels of contamination in marine organisms. It highlights the importance of understanding these processes to assess the sublethal effects of pollutants in the sea and protect marine life against toxic effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Pollution and Contaminants"}
