They describe the macroscopic appearance of the brains, the distribution of cranial nerves, and the structure of the cerebrum, cerebellum, and optic lobes. The study provides insights into the similarities and differences in the nervous system of these species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
