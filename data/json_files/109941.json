These globules, called lymph globules, were first observed by I. Bauer in an aneurismal tumor. The author also mentions the presence of crystals of sulfate of lime, muriate, and phosphate of soda in aneurismal tumors and coagulable lymph. He proposes that these globules are formed in the mesenteric glands and acquire color in the vessels of the lungs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
