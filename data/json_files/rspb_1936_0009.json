They created a salt-free diet and combined it with sweating to induce the deficiency. The subjects experienced weight loss, fatigue, and changes in taste and flavor. The study provided valuable insights into the importance of salt and water balance in the human body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nutrition and Hydration"}
