The authors debate the feasibility of small reactors competing with large ones, the advantages and disadvantages of different reactor designs, and the importance of keeping fast reactor fuel cycle costs low. They also touch upon issues such as metal fuel development, actinide incineration, and molten fuel-coolant interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
