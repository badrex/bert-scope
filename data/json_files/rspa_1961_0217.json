They derive an expression for the cross-section describing electron capture by protons in atomic hydrogen, taking into account momentum transfer and the non-orthogonality of wave functions of initial and final states. The results show agreement with previous calculations in the low and high energy limits.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
