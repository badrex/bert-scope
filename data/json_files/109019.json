These unique organisms have a structure that deviates from previously known foraminiferal types, and their classification remains provisional. Further research may reveal more varieties of arenaceous foraminifera and help elucidate the relationships between these anomalous forms and other known types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
