They found that oblique incidence reflection coefficients are the most promising technique for detecting interlayer properties in adhesive joints. The study focused on the reflection coefficients from aluminum/epoxy interfaces with different interlayers, and the results showed that the technique is sensitive to changes in interlayer thickness and porosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
