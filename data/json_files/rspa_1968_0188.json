Their findings support a hypothesis of repeated hydrothermal mineralizations within the area, with at least two significant episodes occurring around 230 million years and 170 million years ago. This research suggests that episodic hydrothermal alteration of pre-existing rocks may be a widespread phenomenon in Britain.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Geochronology"}
