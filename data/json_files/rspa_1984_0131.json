They provide evidence supporting this identification, including the detection of an oxidized nitrogenous species in partly reacted AP and the ability of ammonium nitrate and other nitrates to reduce the induction period of decomposition. The proposed reaction mechanism differs from current accepted models and offers a more satisfactory theoretical representation of the experimental observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid State Chemistry"}
