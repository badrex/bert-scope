Miller's study of meteorology in the Lake District of Cumberland and Westmorland includes results of rainfall experiments conducted at various heights, from 500 feet to 3166 feet above sea level. The study compares the results of the year 1849 with those of the three preceding years, noting that the quantities of rain deposited at the stations are more equal in a dry year like 1849.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climatology and Meteorology"}
