The authors explore the theoretical aspects of this phenomenon, including the effects of Stark broadening, the sum rule, and the equation of radiative transfer. They also provide a revised formula for the mean Gaunt factor for free-free emission. The study ultimately leads to predictions of the total emission from an HII region.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
