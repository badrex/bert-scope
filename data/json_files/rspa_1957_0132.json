They found that the presence of lithium salts, such as lithium chloride, significantly increased the rate and degree of polymerization. The authors determined the absolute rate coefficients and concluded that the propagation coefficient is higher in the presence of the salt, while the termination coefficient remains almost constant. The results are interpreted in terms of complex formation between polyacrylonitrile radicals and the ions of the salt, which produces changes in the reactivity of the radicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
