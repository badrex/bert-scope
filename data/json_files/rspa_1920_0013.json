They used methods such as conductivity measurements, rate of catalysis, and electromotive force to determine the concentration of hydroxyl ions in the solutions and concluded that the high conductivity is due to the soap itself. The authors also measured the rise of boiling points and lowering of vapour-pressures of soap solutions using a modified dew-point method.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
