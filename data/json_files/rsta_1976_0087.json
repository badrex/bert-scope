They divided the area into three domains based on the orientation of the finite strain fabric and the maximum extension direction in associated shear zones. The domains exhibit different movement patterns and are considered similar to small orogenic belts. The study provides insights into the geological structure and deformation patterns of Archaean rocks in southern Africa.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
