Bees were trained to randomized checkerboard patterns before testing them with sets of other patterns. The results show that bees prefer patterns containing radiating elements and symmetrical patterns, indicating an innate response to features of natural flowers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
