It highlights the difficulties in proving causation and the importance of studying organisms grown in vivo. The author provides a brief survey of the activities of various pathogenic bacteria, focusing on recent work on the resistance of gonococci to killing by human serum and phagocytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
