This changes the place of contraction, allowing every portion to be used in turn. The study provides insights into muscle anatomy, physiology, and pathology, and helps understand the differences between healthy and tetanic muscle contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
