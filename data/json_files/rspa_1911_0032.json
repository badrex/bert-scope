The authors explore the effects of adding different salts and acids to a solution, observing how the solubility of electrolytes changes. They also discuss the use of dissociation constants to determine solubility-product and the impact of solvents on the dissociation of substances in solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
