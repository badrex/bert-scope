The author finds that the catalogues of Dublin and Greenwich agree within narrow limits, and concludes that the mean southern motion, as deduced from the comparison of the two Greenwich catalogues, is an error. The author also discusses the differences in constants of refraction used in the catalogues and their impact on the accuracy of observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
