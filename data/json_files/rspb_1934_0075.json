They describe the size, shape, and mineral composition of these spheroliths, which are formed within the zoaria and are neither calcitic nor siliceous, but phosphatic. The authors also discuss the possible formation and growth process of these spheroliths, as well as their resemblance to pearls.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
