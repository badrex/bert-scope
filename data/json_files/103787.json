He found that refraction affects the accuracy of barometer readings at higher altitudes, making it difficult to determine the true height of a location. He also discovered that the density of the air decreases with elevation, and he developed a method to calculate the required elevation to achieve a specific barometer reading.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
