They introduce a similarity hypothesis that allows for the determination of the energy spectrum for eddies with large Reynolds numbers. The study also discusses the decay of turbulent motion caused by a mesh grating in a wind tunnel and the role of viscosity in reducing the number of degrees of freedom in turbulent systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
