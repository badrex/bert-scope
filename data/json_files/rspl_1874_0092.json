The author finds that taller individuals have a smaller proportion of brain mass compared to their height, while shorter individuals have a larger proportion. The study also shows that the influence of sex on brain weight is more significant than the influence of stature. This research highlights the importance of considering stature when studying brain weight and its variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Biology"}
