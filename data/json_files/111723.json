The paper demonstrates that every odd number can be composed of four squares, and if an odd number can be divided into four squares, then it can also be composed of not more than three triangular numbers. The author provides a detailed explanation of the methods used to prove these theorems and offers examples to illustrate the concepts.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
