They used a modified vacuum arc and an electro-magnet to study the magnetic field's impact on the tantalum spectrum. The study provides valuable insights into the atomic structure and magnetic properties of tantalum, contributing to the understanding of the Zeeman effect in atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
