They discovered that the detonation wave is a combination of an intensively radiating flame-front and an invisible shock wave. The spin occurs when the radiation from an attenuated flame-front causes a localized intensive excitation of molecules in the shock wave, leading to a rotating head of detonation. This research provides a new understanding of detonation and its behavior in gaseous explosions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
