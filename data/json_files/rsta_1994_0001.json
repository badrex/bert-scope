Neutrinos are ghostly particles that can pass through matter without interacting, making them difficult to detect. The author discusses the connection between neutrino astronomy and particle physics, as well as the link with cosmic rays. They also mention the potential role of neutrinos in explaining the missing mass in the universe, known as dark matter. The development of large-area detectors is crucial for advancing neutrino astronomy and discovering new phenomena in the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
