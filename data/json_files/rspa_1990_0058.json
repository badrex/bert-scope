The authors explore the behavior of the function near the negative real axis and provide different bounds for the remainder term after optimal truncation. They also demonstrate how to compute the function accurately using an Euler transformation and discuss the transition between different approximations as the phase of the complex variable changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Asymptotic Analysis"}
