W. Fox, investigated the electrical properties of metals and metalliferous minerals. He discovered that the gray oxide of manganese had a higher position in the electromagnetic scale than other materials when immersed in various solutions. Fox also developed a new galvanometer to measure the deflecting force of electrical impulses. He suggested that electromagnetic action might not depend on a continuous electric current, and the phenomenon could be better explained by the hypothesis of pulsations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
