The design consists of an armature that reciprocates in a uniform magnetic field produced by a stationary superconducting solenoid. The main challenges in the design of these machines include mechanical issues, such as bearings and fatigue, and electrical issues, like low reactance. The article explores the potential benefits and possible solutions to overcome these challenges."}
