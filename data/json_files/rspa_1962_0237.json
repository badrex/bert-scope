They found that at moderate swirls, a large volume of air was entrained at the bend, which can reduce the capacity of the pipe and cause undesirable consequences. The author also studied the collapse of air vortices and the formation of helical striations in the fluid, providing an approximate theory to explain these effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
