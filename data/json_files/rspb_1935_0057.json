They found that X-rays can kill bacteria and that the presence of inorganic salts during irradiation enhances the lethal effect. The study also revealed that X-rays produce chemical changes, such as oxidation and reduction, and that the survival of bacteria follows an exponential relationship with the dose of X-rays. The authors also investigated the effects of X-rays on agar itself, finding no significant changes in the properties of the agar after exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
