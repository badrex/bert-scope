By mimicking the principles of insect vision, such as the use of elementary motion detectors and parallel computation, the robot can effectively steer through complex environments. This approach offers valuable insights for the development of mobile robots with improved navigation capabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Robotics > Mobile Robots"}
