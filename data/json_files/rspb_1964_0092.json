They extend Krogh's model by considering hexagonal symmetry and the decrease in oxygen consumption by cells when oxygen tension falls below a certain value. The study helps to understand the supply of oxygen to living tissues and its implications in biological sciences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomedical Research"}
