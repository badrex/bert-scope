The Carina and Orion complexes are examined as examples, with the Carina complex's gamma-rays possibly resulting from proton acceleration by stellar winds and resonant Alfven-wave scattering in the giant HII region NGC.3372. The Orion complex is also analyzed, with the same model leading to the conclusion that it dominates cosmic rays and is related to star formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Gamma-Ray Astronomy"}
