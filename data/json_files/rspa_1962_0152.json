They found that the dipole moment of the chemisorbed bond is specific to the chemisorbed species and neighboring dipoles have minimal impact. An approximate additivity rule was used to calculate the surface potential change of an adsorbed layer with different adsorbates. The authors also investigated the formation of surface complexes and their decomposition, providing insights into the structure and potential value of the surface potential method.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
