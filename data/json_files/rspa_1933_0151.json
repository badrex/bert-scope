They used an expansion chamber to photograph the tracks of disintegration particles and analyzed the results to test theories about the modes of disintegration. The experiments provided evidence of different ranges and confirmed various modes of disintegration, including the emission of pairs of long-range particles in opposite directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
