The method involves representing the shock surface with a discrete set of points on an adaptive mesh, advancing these points along their surface normals, and using mesh refinement to maintain an even point spacing. The scheme is demonstrated through two fundamental shock propagation problems: shock focusing and shock propagation around a bend in a pipe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
