They discovered that muscles and rubber show a rise in temperature when loaded and a fall in temperature when unloaded. The complex thermal effects observed in muscles are due to their unique elastic properties, which involve a network of colloidal or viscous material containing a fluid. These findings have implications for understanding the elastic properties of various materials and the physiological thermal changes associated with muscular activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
