The author examines the existing theories of dielectric dispersion and suggests that resonance absorption may play a role in the dispersion observed in these polar liquids. The study finds that a single relaxation time can account for the dispersion in these liquids, and the author proposes a new approach to understanding the dielectric properties of polar liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
