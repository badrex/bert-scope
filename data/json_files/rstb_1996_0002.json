They found that the sheep make optimal reproductive decisions given the absence of information about the population cycle. This study represents the first use of a dynamic optimization life history model of realistic complexity in the study of a field population, and the techniques used can be potentially applicable to many other populations and species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Population Dynamics"}
