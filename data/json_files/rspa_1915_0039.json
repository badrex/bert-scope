The authors discovered that the hissing is caused by a true rupture of the water stream at the point of lowest pressure. They found that the temperature at which the hissing just occurs follows a specific law, and that it resembles the critical temperature of water. The study also suggests that the flow is not orderly stream-line motion, and the turbulent portion may be confined to the outflowing portion of the stream.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
