The authors examine the potential and current density for dendrite initiation, as well as the rate of growth at constant overpotential. They also discuss the effect of the dendrite tip radius on the growth rate and the role of diffusion in the process. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of dendritic growth and inform the development of improved electrode materials and processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
