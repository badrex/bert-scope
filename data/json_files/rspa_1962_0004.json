The research focuses on the case where the outer cylinder is at rest and the gap between cylinders is small. The authors investigate the effects of small rates of axial flow and compare their results with Chandrasekhar's perturbation theory. The findings contribute to the understanding of the hydrodynamic stability of viscous flow in this specific context.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
