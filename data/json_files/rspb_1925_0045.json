They found that exposing male mice to a sub-sterility dose of X-rays resulted in abnormal sperm production and a higher number of female offspring. The study suggests that X-ray exposure may affect the fertilizing powers of sperm without causing complete sterility.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
