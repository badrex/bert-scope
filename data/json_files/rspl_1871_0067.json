They discovered that any force or substance that significantly reduces surface tension, such as heat or certain substances like camphor, can cause the state of supersaturation to end. The authors also observed that the spreading of a liquid on a supersaturated solution depends on the surface tension and the tension of the common surface between the liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
