They explain how the visual system organizes itself into channels that are sensitive to specific spatial frequencies and orientations, allowing us to perceive and understand the world around us. The author also explores the implications of this understanding for various real-world scenarios, such as recognizing objects in low light conditions or interpreting the visual information from different spatial frequencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
