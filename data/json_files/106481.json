These phenomena occur when light is refracted in a cloud or turbid atmosphere and are often indicators of stormy and rainy weather. Tunstall's observations provide valuable insights into the nature and occurrence of these rare events.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
