They found that narcotics, such as somnifaine, inhibit the oxidation of substances like glucose, lactic acid, and pyruvic acid in the brain, which may explain the alleviation of psychotic symptoms in some patients. This study highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of narcotic action for the development of more effective mental disorder treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
