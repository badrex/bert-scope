They observe a sequence of viscoelastic flow transitions as the flow rate increases, and the effects of elasticity on the velocity field become more significant. The study reveals a steady, three-dimensional cellular structure in the downstream wake of the cylinder, which is experimentally unstable. Laser Doppler velocimetry and flow visualization techniques are used to analyze the flow, providing insights into the behavior of non-Newtonian fluids at high Deborah numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
