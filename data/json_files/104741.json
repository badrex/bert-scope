He suggests that the mixture of fresh air with sulfurous vapors in the atmosphere can cause violent agitation and effervescence, which may lead to earthquakes. Hales also discusses the relationship between lightning, sulfurous vapors, and the elasticity of air, which can result in hurricanes and thunderstorms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
