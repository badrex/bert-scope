They produce more male offspring in low-quality territories and more female offspring in high-quality territories. This strategy helps parents gain or maintain helpers in high-quality territories, improving their reproductive success. The study provides evidence that this facultative sex ratio bias is caused by skewed offspring production rather than mortality differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
