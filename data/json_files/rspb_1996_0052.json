The author, Steven A. Frank, explains how hosts favor reduced mixing of symbionts to increase within-host relatedness and lower virulence. This conflict is analyzed in various biological examples, including figs and their pollinator wasps, and the importance of understanding these interactions is highlighted for a broader range of phenomena in the study of symbiosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
