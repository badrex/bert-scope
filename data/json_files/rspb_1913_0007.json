They found that the process is dependent on the conditions surrounding the nerve fiber, rather than solely on the life of the animal. The study provides insights into the understanding of nerve regeneration and the role of the organism's defense mechanisms in nerve fiber functioning.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
