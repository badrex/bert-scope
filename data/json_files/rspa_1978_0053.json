The research uses conditional averaging to separate the non-random and random parts of the fluctuations, allowing for a better understanding of the energy transfer mechanisms among the mean flow, large-scale structure, and fine-grained turbulence. The findings provide insights into the growth and development of turbulent shear flows and can help improve predictive schemes and experimental studies of organized structures in fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
