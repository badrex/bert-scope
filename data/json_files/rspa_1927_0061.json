The authors analyze the oscillatory motion and axial velocity of each vortex ring, considering the effects of disturbances on the system. They find that the system is unstable for all values of the parameters, highlighting the importance of understanding the behavior of vortices in fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
