It explores the dimensional features and properties of various protein structures, such as a- and b-keratin, and examines the role of X-ray crystallography in understanding protein structure. The article also highlights the importance of considering the density and arrangement of proteins in their natural state.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
