The researchers describe the foregut, midgut, and hindgut in detail, explaining how particles of food pass through the digestive system and how digestion and absorption occur in the ventral caeca. The study also discusses the role of the hindgut in maintaining the ionic concentration of the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
