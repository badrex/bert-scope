They provide a general procedure to express these averages as integrals over time of appropriate time-correlation functions. The results are applicable to thermal equilibrium and steady-state situations, covering a wide range of important concepts in statistical theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical mechanics"}
