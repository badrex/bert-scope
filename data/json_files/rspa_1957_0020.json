They introduce an assumption relating the fourth-order velocity correlation to those of lower order and derive a pair of simultaneous differential equations for the energy-spectrum function. The study examines the dynamics and properties of these equations, applying them to various initial types of energy spectrum and comparing the solution with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
