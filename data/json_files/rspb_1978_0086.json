These models help confirm or refute proposed structures and mechanisms and may lead to a purely photochemical system for capturing and storing solar energy. Recent progress in kinetic investigations and energy transfer studies is also described.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
