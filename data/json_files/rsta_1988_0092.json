It describes the Warp systolic array machine and its components, as well as nine computational models for ID processor arrays, with an emphasis on local computation, domain partition, pipeline, multifunction pipeline, and ring models. These models help in understanding the communication patterns between processors during computation and can be used to derive machine architectures, provide guidelines for programming tools, and suggest how parallel computers should be used in applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Computer Science"}
