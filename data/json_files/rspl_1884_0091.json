They discovered that sectioning the nerve caused an increase in the secretion from both submaxillary glands, with the secretion on the side of the body where the nerve was cut being more profound. The author proposed that this increase in secretion was due to an increase in the irritability of both the central and local secretory centers, which were stimulated by the blood supplied to them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nerve Physiology"}
