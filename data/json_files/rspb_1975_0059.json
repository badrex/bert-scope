The authors investigate the sources, uses, and environmental impact of these compounds, including their toxicity to aquatic organisms. They also study the chemical and microbial degradation processes to determine their removal from the environment and estimate the half-lives of these compounds. The authors conclude that these compounds are not persistent in the environment and do not cause significant bioaccumulation in marine food chains.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Environmental Chemistry"}
