This correspondence is achieved by writing the metrics in adapted coordinates and gauges for the two-centre problem and black holes with event horizons. The author demonstrates this method using the example of two extreme Reissner-Nordstrom black holes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
