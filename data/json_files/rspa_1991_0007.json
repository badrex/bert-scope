This phenomenon occurs when a system sits on a fractal basin boundary, making the outcome of the jump unpredictable. The authors demonstrate this new phenomenon in various softening oscillators and discuss its implications for resonance and escape boundaries in nonlinear dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Chaos Theory"}
