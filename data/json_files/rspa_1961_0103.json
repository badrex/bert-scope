The authors present a theoretical analysis of the patterns, which are generated by an aperture consisting of an opaque screen with 64 transparent holes arranged in a circular shape. The patterns are described by three curves, each representing different features of the diffraction pattern.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
