They observed starlight at the Daramona House Observatory and found that the energy of the incident light is proportional to the square of the electromotive force generated by the cell. This method allowed them to compare the energy of stars to that of the sun and determine the distance of stars based on their parallax.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
