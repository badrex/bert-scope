The researchers developed a new method to measure the rate of this reaction and found that the rate of carbon monoxide binding to hemoglobin is much faster than the rate of oxygen binding. This discovery has implications for understanding how carbon monoxide poisoning affects the body and for developing treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
