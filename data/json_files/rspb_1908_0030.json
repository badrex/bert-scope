The author finds that raffinose is less easily hydrolyzed than cane sugar, taking about five times longer for half of the raffinose to break down. The results show that raffinose is hydrolyzed at a rate nearly one-fifth less than that of cane sugar, and it can be resolved into galactose and cane sugar or fructose and a biose isomeric with cane sugar by the action of invertase.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Carbohydrate chemistry"}
