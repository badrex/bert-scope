Hertz's experiment showed that cathode rays could pass through thin metallic foils without making a visible hole, leading to the conclusion that they were not charged particles. This challenged the prevailing belief that cathode rays were electrified particles and opened up new possibilities for understanding their behavior and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
