The author suggests that chert beds are formed due to the replacement of the original limestone by silica, which occurs when the limestone is exposed to warm, shallow seas rich in silica. The presence of marine life, such as corals, crinoids, and foraminifera, supports this theory, as their shells or skeletons are made of carbonate of lime rather than silica. The author also provides chemical analyses and photographic figures of thin slices of chert to support their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
