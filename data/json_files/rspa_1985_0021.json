They find oscillatory solutions for both positive and negative values of the parameter, confirming recent numerical results. The authors also conjecture the existence of infinitely many periodic solutions and propose a form of symbolic dynamics similar to the horseshoe map for small values of the parameter. This research contributes to the understanding of complex structures and chaotic behavior in fluid mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
