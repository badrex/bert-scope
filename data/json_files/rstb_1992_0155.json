The research finds that both morphological and molecular changes show a moderately strong correlation with time elapsed, but a weaker correlation with one another. The molecular clock rate for echinaceans is found to be three times faster than that for cidaroids and irregular echinoids. The study highlights the importance of combining molecular sequences, morphology, and the fossil record to better understand evolutionary rates and relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
