The authors analyze the unitary transformation connecting the two hamiltonians and examine the problem of displaying the binding energies of molecular systems. They derive the hamiltonian and discuss its implications, including the importance of gauge conditions and the role of arbitrary coefficients in the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
