The research finds that the crystal structure plays a significant role in the magneto-resistance effect, with the change in resistance being gradual and continuous. The results suggest that there are two effects causing the resistance to change: one giving an initial and final gradual decrease, and the other producing a rapid change in resistance, which is similar to the longitudinal resistance effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
