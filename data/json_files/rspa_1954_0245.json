The research focuses on vitrain coals with varying ranks, analyzing the scattering at high angles to determine the diameters of graphitic layers and their percentage in the coal. Fourier transforms reveal the occurrence of layers in groups and their preferred orientation parallel to the bedding plane. The scattering at low and very small angles is also examined, suggesting the presence of anisotropic cracks and pores of various sizes. A proposed structural model of coal is discussed, explaining coalification as a process of condensation, ordering of layers, and flattening of the structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
