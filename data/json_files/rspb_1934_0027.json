They found that these worms act as reservoirs of infection and can be a danger to young chickens raised on contaminated land. The study also shows that Lumbricus terrestris can carry the disease but with less severity compared to Eisenia foetida.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
