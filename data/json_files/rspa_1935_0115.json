The authors develop a formula for the probability of evaporation, considering the transfer of a quantum of vibrational energy from the solid to the adsorbed atom. They also discuss the limitations of their theory and the potential impact of many-quantum emissions on the evaporation process. The study provides insights into the average lifespan of adsorbed atoms on surfaces and can be applied to various adsorption systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface chemistry"}
