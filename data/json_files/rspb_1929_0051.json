They discovered a selective action by different X-ray wavelengths, causing either hypertrophic or atrophic reactions in the tissue. This study provides insights into the potential applications of X-rays in cancer research and treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
