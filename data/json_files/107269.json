They develop a method to determine the attractive forces and decompose them into other forces with fixed directions. The study includes the effects of ellipsoidal geometry, fluid mechanics, and celestial mechanics on the attraction between masses.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
