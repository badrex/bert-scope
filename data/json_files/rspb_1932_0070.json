They found that differentiation often occurred, with specialized cells appearing in cultures where they could not have been present at explantation. The study focused on the development of red blood cells and provided a simple method to obtain large numbers of them. This research served as an introduction to a physiological study of the conditions of hematopoiesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
