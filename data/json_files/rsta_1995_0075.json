It highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of frozen soils and the consequences of melting due to global warming. The article also explores the implications of these changes for the design and construction of highways, airports, buildings, and pipelines in cold regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geotechnical Engineering"}
