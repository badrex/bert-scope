He found that the contents of the alimentary canal in foetuses were similar in appearance and chemical composition to those in adults. Lee concluded that the liver supplies materials for nutrition in the foetus, and that these substances are not derived from the mouth. This research also applies to acephalous children and cases where the oesophagus is impervious.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Anatomy and Physiology"}
