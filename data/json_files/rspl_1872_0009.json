This process, called intramolecular atomic interchange, allows for the creation of a series of aromatic monamines, including dimethyltoluidine, methylxylidine, and cumidine. The reaction mechanism involves the movement of methyl groups within the benzol nucleus, raising the carbon content of the compounds and creating more carbonated series of compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
