This method allows for more accurate temperature determination by comparing the absorption and emission of sodium lines in two separate light beams. The technique uses interference filters to isolate the sodium wavelength, improving sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio. This advancement enables the study of temperature history behind shock waves and provides insights into molecular processes and relaxation times.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Shock Wave Physics"}
