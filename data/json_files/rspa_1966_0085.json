The authors calculate the equivalent axial distribution of charge along the conductor's centerline and determine the force acting on it. The study provides a method to calculate the force on any axisymmetric conductor in contact with a plane, given the equivalent distribution of charge along the axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
