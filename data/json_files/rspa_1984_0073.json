The Berne-Pechukas-Kushick potential is used as the model for polar liquids in a series of molecular dynamics simulations. Results for thermodynamic properties, distribution functions, and dielectric constants are discussed, along with the behavior of cross-correlations between dipole orientations and their importance to dielectric relaxation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
