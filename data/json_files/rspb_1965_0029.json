The researchers found that the maximum tension transmitted by collagen in tendons of fusiform muscles was significantly greater than that in penniform muscles. Tendon thickness was also found to be relatively higher in slow, red, fusiform muscles compared to fast, white muscles. These findings provide insights into the factors that determine tendon size and its role in muscle function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
