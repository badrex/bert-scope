Researchers found that highland children, particularly boys, are taller, heavier, and larger in most physical dimensions than lowland children. Skeletal maturation is more delayed in lowlanders, but both groups experience an acceleration of skeletal maturation during early puberty. The study concludes that high-altitude environments in Ethiopia are more favorable for growth than low-altitude environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Anthropology"}
