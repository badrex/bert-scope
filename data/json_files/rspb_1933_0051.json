{"article_id": "rspb_1933_0051", "revised_title": "The Three Phases of Nerve Heat Production and Their Implications", "semantic_tags": ["Nerve Heat Production", "Neurophysiology", "Thermodynamics", "Recovery Heat", "Initial Heat"], "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology", "tldr": "The author's study of nerve heat production reveals three distinct phases: initial heat, rapid recovery, and slow recovery. The initial heat occurs abruptly at the beginning of stimulation and decreases during the stimulus. The rapid recovery phase is complete within a few seconds, while the slow recovery phase takes minutes to reach a steady rate. These findings provide insight into the complex processes of nerve conduction and recovery."}
