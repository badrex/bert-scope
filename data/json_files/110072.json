They found that the elastic force of steel remains the same regardless of its temper, and the ratio of force producing permanent alteration to the force causing fracture in hard steel is 1:166. The author also concluded that the process of hardening steel involves a state of tension among particles, which reduces their ability to resist external force.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
