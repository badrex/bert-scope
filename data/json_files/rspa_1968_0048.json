They found that the decay reaction of these radicals was second-order in temperature range of 294 to 500 K. The authors also studied the recombination of two radicals and proposed a mechanism involving atomic chlorine and the short-lived peroxy radical. This research provides insights into the chemical reactions and processes involving oxy-halogen radicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
