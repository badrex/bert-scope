By cooling protein crystals to liquid nitrogen temperatures, their stability and resistance to radiation damage can be significantly improved. This allows for longer and more accurate diffraction pattern analysis, which is essential for understanding the structure and function of proteins. The findings suggest that using small crystals, rapid freezing, and improving synchrotron X-ray source intensities can lead to more productive research in this field.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}
