They observe that the acrosome, a cap-like structure on the sperm head, varies greatly in size and shape between species and is a relatively unstable structure that breaks down after the cell dies. The perforatorium, a structure covering the apex of the nucleus, is demonstrated in five rodent species and is suggested to exist in all mammalian spermatozoa, though usually in a less distinctive form.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
