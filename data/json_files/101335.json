He also describes the importance of the interaction between these salts and earthy particles in the formation of fixed salts and their resistance to dissolution. The author provides a method for separating and volatilizing fixed salts using fermentation and crude tartar as a ferment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Salt chemistry and Volatilization"}
