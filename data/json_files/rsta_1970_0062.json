They determine ionization potentials and analyze the vibrational structure associated with these transitions, providing valuable insights into the molecular structures and electronic properties of these polyatomic molecules. This research contributes to the understanding of molecular structures and the development of molecular orbital theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
