The research observes a characteristic sequence of degenerative changes in axon terminals, including increased electron density, loss of synaptic vesicles, and disruption of mitochondria. Astrocytic processes play a significant role in breaking down degenerating products. The findings contribute to understanding the nature and rate of degeneration in different parts of the cat's brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
