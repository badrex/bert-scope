They propose a new phylogenetic classification that includes three groups: Protosaurian, Therapsidan, and Diapsidan reptiles. The author emphasizes the importance of the structure of the heart and the skeleton of the hind foot in determining reptile affinities and affirms that the hook-shaped metatarsal is a specialization found in the common ancestor of various reptile orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
