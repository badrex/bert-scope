It presents constructions for these curves and explores their relationship with special cubics, such as the equianharmonic cubic. The author also investigates the conditions for a cubic to be harmonic and the properties of the inflexional tangents.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
