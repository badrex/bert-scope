They discuss the properties of multenions, including their algebraic structure, vector complexes, and various types of linities. The author also explains how multenions can be applied to differential invariants and highlights their importance in understanding complex mathematical concepts.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra and Geometry"}
