The method uses symmetry-adapted harmonic vectors in Kelvin's solution of the problem of the sphere and provides results for silicon carbide spheres in an aluminium matrix. The study highlights the importance of understanding stress distribution in composites for technological applications and fracture analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
