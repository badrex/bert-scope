They found that under certain conditions, both gases produce a single bright green line in the spectrum. By combining the gases, the relative intensity of the green lines varied. The author also observed that the temperature of nebulae is lower than that of the sun and their tenuity is excessive. This research suggests that spectrum analysis can provide valuable information about the physical constitution of celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
