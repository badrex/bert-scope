He used two pendulums, one made for M. Schumacher and another belonging to the Board of Longitude. The comparison was made at the Royal Observatory in Paris, and the results showed a final acceleration of 12.00 for the seconds pendulum in passing from Paris to London. This research helped to establish more accurate standards of length and time measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
