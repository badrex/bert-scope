Phylogenetic analyses indicate that cross-species transmission events have been frequent, with HIV-1 and HIV-2 appearing to have resulted from multiple transfers of lentiviruses naturally infecting other primates. The study also provides evidence of recombination between divergent viruses in vivo, which has important implications for HIV vaccine development programs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
