Instead, they suggest that the major minerals of ordinary chondrites have chemical compositions indicative of formation from a medium greatly depleted in hydrogen and somewhat deficient in oxygen relative to solar matter. This depletion in hydrogen and oxygen led to the re-evaporation of condensed material, which then formed the minerals of the ordinary chondrites.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Planetary Science"}
