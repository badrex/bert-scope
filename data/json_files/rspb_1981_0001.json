They discuss the construction of directionally selective units and their use in separating moving objects from one another and the background. The study also proposes a specific model of information processing by retinal and cortical cells, leading to several psychophysical and neurophysiological predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
