They use a direct method to determine the most stable arrangement of ions in the crystal lattice, which requires only one parameter to fix the size and shape of the rhombohedral cell. This method provides an absolute measure of the crystal's stability, which is not yet determined by other methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
