The results indicate that the scattering behavior is influenced by the presence of high-speed secondary electrons, which can affect the accuracy of elastic scattering measurements. The findings also suggest that the discrepancy between experimental data and theoretical predictions may be due to the influence of secondary electrons. The authors compare their results with the Wentzel wave mechanics formula for elastic scattering by an atom, concluding that the observed behavior does not require significant modification of the existing scattering laws."}
