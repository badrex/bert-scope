The committee appointed by the British Association for the Advancement of Science aimed to determine the best standard of electrical resistance. They eventually issued a new standard, which was based on a column of chemically pure mercury 1 meter long with a section equal to 1 millimeter square, maintained at a temperature of 0\u00b0C. This standard aimed to address the discrepancies and inconsistencies found between different sets of resistance coils used in telegraphy and electrical measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
