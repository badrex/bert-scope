They introduce mutual bond polarizabilities and demonstrate their relationship to similar quantities in molecular orbital theory. The study provides a more accurate method for understanding the structure and behavior of conjugated hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
