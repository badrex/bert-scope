They propose a theory of \"residual affinity\" to explain the behavior of electrolytes and the role of molecular structure in their conductivity. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the electrical behavior of pure fused salts for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
