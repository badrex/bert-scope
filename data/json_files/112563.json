The survey was undertaken by the British government and involved observations of the Earth's magnetic field, including declination, inclination, and intensity. The findings are accompanied by three maps illustrating the isogonic, isoclinal, and isodynamic lines. The paper also discusses the revision of Gauss's 'Allgemeine Theory des Erdmagnetismus'.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
