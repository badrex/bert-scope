They explore various methods of separation and purification, including sublimation and spectroscopy, and find that sublimation of the oxides can effectively separate the elements. The author also discusses the preparation of purified selenion and the challenges faced during the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Elemental analysis"}
