The authors describe their experimental setup and the results obtained from compressing various substances, including beeswax, chloroform, ether, paraffin, and phosphorus. They also discuss the differences in heat production between different materials and the potential implications for understanding the physical properties of allotropic forms of elementary substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
