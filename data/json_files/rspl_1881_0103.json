The author, W. H. L. Russell, develops a technique for integrating specific types of equations and shares his findings on the behavior of gas pressure in electric arcs, as observed by Professor Dewar.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus", "sub_discipline": "Applied Mathematics > Dynamical Problems"}
