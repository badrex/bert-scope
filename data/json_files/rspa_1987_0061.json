The study shows that the model gives rise to a structurally stable singularity, and the organizing center for the model has a normal form with 14 structurally stable bifurcation diagrams when the inlet concentration of species A is greater than three times that of species B. When the inlet concentration of species A is smaller than three times that of species B, the organizing singularity is a winged cusp, and the behavior of the autocatalator is similar to the classical problem of a single exothermic reaction in a CSTR.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Engineering"}
