They find that the absorption spectrum changes depending on the state of aggregation, which can be influenced by factors such as the solvent, temperature, and the presence of electrolytes. The study also highlights the importance of considering the state of aggregation when analyzing color changes in dyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloid Chemistry"}
