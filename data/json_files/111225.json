They observed that the male's antenna has a hypertrophied condition with modified segments, while the female's antennae are symmetrical. The author also noted the crustacean's tendency to move towards the left side, attributing it to the brain's right side being more developed and giving predominance to the power of the locomotive organs on that side.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
