They discuss the relationship between hydrogen liberation and its disappearance, and how this potential is maintained within the cell. The study highlights the role of oxidation-reduction potential in the synthesis of alanin and the importance of molecular oxygen in cellular respiration. The authors also explore the use of indicators to measure intracellular potential and the role of carriers like glutathione in oxidation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
