They found that about half the current in the tube is brought up to the cathode by positively charged particles with sufficient velocity to pass through the slit. The experiments also investigated the distribution of velocity in the stream of positive particles falling upon the cathode, but the results were inconclusive due to the complexity of the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
