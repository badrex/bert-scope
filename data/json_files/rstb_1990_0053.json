Act-2 is a secreted protein that shares homology with other proteins in two related families of small secreted proteins. The interleukin-2 receptor is composed of three distinct classes of receptors, and the high-affinity receptors are crucial for transducing the major proliferative signals of IL-2.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
