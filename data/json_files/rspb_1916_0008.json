They discovered that the germicidal action of hypochlorites is due to chemical reactions with proteins in microorganisms. The formation of substances containing halogen linked to nitrogen, such as chloramines, plays a significant role in their germicidal properties. The authors also investigated various types of chloramines and their reactions with amino-acids, proteins, and other substances, leading to the development of new antiseptic compounds like Chloramine-T.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
