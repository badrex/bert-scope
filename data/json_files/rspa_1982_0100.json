The authors provide uniform asymptotic estimates for radiation efficiency at high modal densities and discuss various regions and transition zones for plate wavenumber components. The study confirms and extends earlier results, offering a better understanding of the effects of more complicated features on panel vibrations and sound radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Acoustics and Vibration"}
