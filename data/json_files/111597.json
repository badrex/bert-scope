Crace Calvert and R. Johnson, conducted experiments to determine the conductivity of mercury and amalgams. They discovered that the apparent conductivity of mercury was high due to heat transfer by convection, and when the experiments were adjusted to account for this, the actual conductivity was found to be much lower. The authors also investigated the conductivity of various amalgams and compound bars, finding that some materials, like bismuth and antimony, conducted heat as expected.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
