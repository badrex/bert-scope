It highlights the need for a synergistic interaction between those who study geological data and those who model global climates. The authors emphasize the relevance of this study for predicting future climate change and understanding the past for the discovery of valuable geological resources.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Palaeoclimatology"}
