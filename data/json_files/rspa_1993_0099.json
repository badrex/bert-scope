The structure of the low salt T-state crystals is maintained by a few well-defined salt bridges and hydrogen bonds, which prevent the larger quaternary movements associated with oxygenation. This stability enables the researchers to study ligand binding and the structural basis of the T-state's low affinity for oxygen directly through X-ray diffraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
