The authors analyze the data using classical and quantum theories, finding that the scattering is proportional to the atomic number and that the observed absorption and scattering exceed theoretical predictions for shorter wavelengths. The results support the identification of two terms in the absorption coefficient, representing scattering and true absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
