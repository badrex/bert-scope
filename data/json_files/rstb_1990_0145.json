These particles may play a navigational role during the high-seas migration of the salmon, suggesting the presence of a magnetosensory system capable of responding to magnetic field direction. The magnetic particles are associated with the lateral line, supporting the theory that the magnetic field detector in salmon may have evolved by modifying an existing system with a conventional function rather than developing a system exclusively for magnetoreception.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
