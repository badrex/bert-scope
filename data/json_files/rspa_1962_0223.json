They mention a recent preprint by A. H. Taub, who started the approximation with another tensor, and explore the potential of expanding in powers of the gravitational field. The authors also present a method of constructing new solutions to linear, special relativistic partial differential equations, focusing on null, curling solutions of Maxwell's and linearized Einstein's equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
