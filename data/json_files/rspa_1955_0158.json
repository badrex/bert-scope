They provide formulas and analyze the frequency response, considering both circular and rectangular apertures. The results show that the response function can be used to calculate image distributions for various objects and that the lens's response is symmetrical about the true focal plane.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics"}
