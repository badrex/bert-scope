It highlights the importance of seabirds as they accumulate pollutants in their bodies and can provide valuable information on the extent of pollution in marine environments. The article also explores the use of seabirds in demonstrating sublethal effects and lethal impacts of pollution, emphasizing the need for continued monitoring and research to understand the full scope of pollution's impact on these species and their ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
