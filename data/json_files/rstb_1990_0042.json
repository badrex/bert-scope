The results show that the overall shape of the wing path is altered, including variations in wing-beat amplitude and angles of attack. The calculated flight forces are insufficient to account for the measured lift, thrust, and torque responses to the stimuli, suggesting that unsteady aerodynamic mechanisms play a significant role in flapping flight.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
