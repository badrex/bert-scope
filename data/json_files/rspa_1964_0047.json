They calculate the energies and wave functions of the electronic states and obtain mesomeric dipole moments and oscillator strengths of the spectral bands. The study explains spectral changes due to steric twisting of substituent groups and provides insights into the delocalization of electrons between the substituent and the hydrocarbon in different states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
