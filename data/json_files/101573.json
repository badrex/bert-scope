Mariotte conducts experiments and observations to challenge Pecquet's claims, arguing that the Retina plays a significant role in vision. He explains how light is refracted and reflected in the eye, and how the Choroeides and Retina work together to enable clear vision. Mariotte also discusses the differences in eye structure and function among various animals, such as humans, birds, and other creatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Optics"}
