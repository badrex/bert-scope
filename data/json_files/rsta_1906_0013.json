They used high voltages to create visible refraction margins in very dilute solutions and designed a special apparatus to prevent mixing of the solutions during the experiment. This method allowed for more accurate measurements of ionic velocities and provided insights into the behavior of ions in different salts and concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
