The theory predicts the reorientation of fibers with strain and shows good agreement with experimental results from spinal ligaments. It may also have applications in drawn polymers, as demonstrated with polyethylene and polyethylene terephthalate.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Composite Materials"}
