One method involves constructing a pendulum with different metals, brass, and iron, that expand at different rates, compensating for the temperature-induced length changes. The other method involves a temperature measurement instrument, the pyrometer, to monitor and adjust the clock's performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
