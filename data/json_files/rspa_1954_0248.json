This method applies to molecular-orbital and valence-bond functions and is suitable for complex molecules. The authors demonstrate the method's effectiveness by applying it to the lithium molecule and lithium hydride molecule, yielding results in good agreement with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
