These baryons share similar properties with gaseous galactic discs, suggesting that they are early-stage galaxies. The discovery challenges the standard picture of galactic evolution and provides insights into the formation and development of galaxies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Galaxy Formation"}
