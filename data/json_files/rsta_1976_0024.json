The authors study the diffraction of fast electrons by a thin slab and find that the pattern symmetries can be described by thirty-one diffraction groups. They provide tables to help identify crystal point groups from these patterns and demonstrate the method with experiments on germanium and gallium-arsenide specimens.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
