They found that the experimental Lorenz curve deviated from modern theories of metallic conduction, and the predicted minimum in thermal conductivity was not observed. The results suggest that lattice vibrations may not conform to the Debye spectrum, and further research is needed to understand the deviations from theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
