The author criticizes previous attempts to calculate the frequency-dependent term and offers an alternative calculation based on the continuum model developed in earlier papers. The theory explains the anomalous longitudinal relaxation time in nematic liquid crystals and provides a formula for the rotating-frame relaxation rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
