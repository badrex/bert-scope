They used photographic plates stained with dicyanin to photograph the spectrum of mercury, extending it to wavelengths up to 11137 A.U. They identified forty-four new wave-lengths in the spectrum of mercury and found that luminous mercury vapour can be photographed at least as far as X = 11137 A.U., providing a new means of investigating the character of such important radiations as X = 10140 A.U. and studying their specific properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
