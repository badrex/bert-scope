They developed an air thermometer and used it to measure the temperature, finding that the melting point of well-purified mercury is practically a constant temperature, regardless of the specimen or mass. This research contributed to the understanding of thermodynamics and temperature measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
