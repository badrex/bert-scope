They found that local field responses could be evoked by stimulation of various sites, while unit responses required specific frequencies and facilitation. The number of sites capable of evoking unit responses decreased in slices from chicks older than 4 days. This study provides evidence for the viability of the forebrain slice preparation and sheds light on the neural changes underlying behavioral plasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
