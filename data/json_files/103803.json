The smallpox symptoms were more severe than usual, with pains in the limbs, back, nausea, and vomiting. The disease was characterized by small, flat pustules and intense itching. Patients often had difficulty salivating and experienced swelling in the face and throat. Dr. Huxham discusses the possible causes of these unusual symptoms and suggests treatments, such as bleeding, emollient clysters, and dilution, to help patients recover.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Epidemiology"}
