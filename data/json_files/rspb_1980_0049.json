Initially, many muscle fibers are innervated by both foreign nerves, but over time, many endplates are eliminated, leaving most fibers innervated by only a single axon. The elimination of functional endplates is caused by a retraction of nerve terminals from the postsynaptic site, suggesting a competitive interaction between motor axons innervating the same muscle fiber.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuromuscular Biology"}
