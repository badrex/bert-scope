The research focuses on the symbiosis between the algal species Gymnodinium microadriaticum and the staghorn coral Acropora cervicornis. The results show that ammonia increases the photosynthetic rate and excretion rate of symbionts in vivo and in vitro, while nitrate and urea have no significant effect on these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
