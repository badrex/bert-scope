It explores the importance of catalytic cycles involving nitrogen oxides, hydrogen radicals, and chlorine species in the stratosphere's chemistry. The article highlights the need for measurements of trace species, their precursors, and their reaction products to understand the stratosphere's chemistry and its impact on the ozone layer."}
