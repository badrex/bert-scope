This discovery sheds light on the early evolution of reptiles and their relationships to other ancient vertebrates. The study also discusses the significance of Millerosaurus in understanding the development of other reptile groups, such as Chelonia, Procolophonia, and Pareiasauria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
