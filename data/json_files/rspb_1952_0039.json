The institute focuses on the study of microorganisms in the alimentary tract and their role in digestion. Researchers at the institute have investigated the breakdown of cellulose, starch, and other complex carbohydrates by microorganisms, and the nutritional importance of short-chain fatty acids produced during fermentation. The institute also publishes Nutrition Abstracts, a quarterly journal providing abstracts of important papers on nutrition from around the world."}
