They traced the course of these fiber tracts in different planes and provided a comprehensive analysis of their connections and appearances in three dimensions. This research contributes to the understanding of the brain's structure and function in lower animals, which can be compared to the human brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain anatomy"}
