The polychaetes have numerous compound eyes on their branchial tentacles, while the ark clams have large numbers of compound eyes along the mantle edge. These eyes act as visual alarm systems, triggering protective responses like retraction and shell closure. The research also discusses the evolutionary origin of these visual organs and the importance of understanding why some eyes are compound and others simple.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
