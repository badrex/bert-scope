They discover that the pellets form due to a plastic flow of the metal under high instantaneous pressure, and propose a hypothesis explaining their formation. The author also studies the secondary flash of detonation and the enormous velocity at which the reaction propagates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
