The authors demonstrate the validity of their method through experiments on coupled plates, showing that SEA predictions can accurately estimate energy transmission between structures. The research has implications for understanding and improving vibration isolation and structural acoustics in various engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Vibration and Acoustics"}
