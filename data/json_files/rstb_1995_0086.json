It explains how the expected nucleotide diversity and frequency spectrum can be calculated under this model, and how it can help explain low levels of genetic variation observed in certain regions of the genome. The study suggests that the coalescent process under this model leads to gene trees with a shape similar to neutral trees, resulting in a sample frequency spectrum like the neutral one."}
