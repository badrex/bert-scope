Basic Equations and Model Formulation", "semantic_tags": ["Oceanography", "Hydrodynamics", "Water motion", "Numerical modeling", "Lake Michigan"], "tldr": "This article presents numerical models and observations of water motion in Green Bay, Lake Michigan. It discusses the basic equations and model formulation used to study the co-oscillation of water in the bay. The models help determine the natural modes of oscillation and the impact of wind and currents on water motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
