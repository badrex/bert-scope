He provides evidence for the motion of several stars and suggests that most of these stars, which have been observed to move, are likely the closest to us. He also shares his findings on changes in the positions of stars since Flamstead's time and the importance of using telescopes with various powers to detect and study these changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
