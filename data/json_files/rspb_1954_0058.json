The authors differentiate the fully developed cuticle into hard tergites and flexible intersegmental membranes. They also explore the hardening process, tanning mechanism, and the transitional zone between tergites and arthrodial membranes, known as the intermediate sclerite.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
