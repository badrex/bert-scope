It explores how the cells adapt to the presence of azide, leading to the production of resistant strains and the emergence of mutant cells with metabolic deficiencies. The study also examines the growth characteristics of yeast cells in liquid and solid media containing sodium azide.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
