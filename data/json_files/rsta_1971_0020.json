The authors present data from a study conducted on the crest and east flank of the M.A.R. at 8\u00b0S, examining the structural and magmatic evolution of the ridge. They explore the effects of post-eruption processes on trace element data and discuss the potential influence of these processes on the composition of the mantle source and the mechanisms that produce basaltic magma.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Tectonics"}
