They find that the presence of multiple holes influences each other, leading to a reduction in maximum stress due to the shielding effect. The study provides a mathematical solution for stress distribution in perforated plates, which can be useful for engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
