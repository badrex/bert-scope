The results show that pepsin-digested antitoxin is transmitted less readily than the whole antitoxin, with concentration quotients ranging from less than 1/6 to less than 1/30 of those for natural antitoxin. This suggests that the pepsinized moiety of an homologous antitoxin molecule is transmitted less readily than the whole.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
