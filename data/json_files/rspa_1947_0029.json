They test their theory on thirty-eight materials and find that introducing a term from the series equation significantly improves the fit for materials that do not follow Nutting's equation. The authors propose that the relative importance of the second term in the series equation may reveal the presence of undissipated stresses in materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
