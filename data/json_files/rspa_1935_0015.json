They studied the decay periods of the radioactive bodies and the energy distribution of the positive electrons. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the nature of radioactive isotopes and the potential applications of particle acceleration in nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
