They used a curved metal plate and observed how the pressure varied with the angle of incidence. The results showed that the normal component of the pressure decreased as the angle of incidence increased. The author also investigated the influence of curvature on resistance at perpendicular incidence and found that the pressure per unit area decreased as the curvature increased.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
