They found that radioactivity was mainly incorporated into phosphatidylcholine, phosphatidylethanolamine, and ornithine lipid. The study also demonstrated a precursor-product relationship between the methylated phospholipids and phosphatidylcholine, and showed that the a-carbon of glycine gives rise to one-carbon fragments and acetate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
