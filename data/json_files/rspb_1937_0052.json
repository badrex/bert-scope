They used muscle haemoglobin as an indicator of oxygen tension and found that it can act as a short-time oxygen store and intracellular indicator. The method provides a \"metabolic microscope\" with instant action, allowing for better understanding of muscle metabolism and its changes during contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
