The event was also observed in other parts of the Caribbean, such as Barbados, Martinique, and the island of Sabia. The sea rose twelve feet perpendicular several times and returned quickly to its original level. This phenomenon was accompanied by an earthquake, which was the second one felt in Antigua. The event caused significant damage to coffee plantations and houses in the affected areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Natural Disasters"}
