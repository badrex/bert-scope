It examines the diverse forms of surface coats on various cell types, including rickettsiae, bacteria, amoebae, sea-urchin eggs, and cat intestinal microvilli. The author presents new observations on the form of the glycocalyx and its role in cell recognition, adhesiveness, adsorption, protection, and cell movement. The article also highlights the importance of electron microscopy and other techniques in studying the glycocalyx and its function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
