By recording the electro-oculogram of one eye while imposing movements on the other eye during the vestibulo-ocular reflex, they found that the amplitude of eye movement decreases as the peak velocity of the imposed eye movement increases. This suggests a corrective function for the extraocular muscle afferent signals in the oculomotor control system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
