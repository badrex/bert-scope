The theoretical computation of the vapor distribution over a parabolic area is repeated using a new value for the constant, evaluated by analogy with the form taken up by the corresponding coefficient in Calder's development. The results show a good comparison with experimental values, improving on previous two-dimensional theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
