Techniques such as resonant magneto-tunnelling spectroscopy (RMTS) are used to explore energy levels, dispersion curves, and localized states in quantum wells and wires. The author discusses various applications of these techniques in condensed matter physics, including the study of quantum chaos and hole dispersion in quantum wells.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
