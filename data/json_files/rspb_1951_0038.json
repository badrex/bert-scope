They discovered that when Daphnia are in water with low oxygen levels, their haemoglobin content increases, which helps them survive longer, gather food more efficiently, swim more energetically, and reproduce more. This is important for Daphnia living in environments with low oxygen levels, such as buried in mud.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
