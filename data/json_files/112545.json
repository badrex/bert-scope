He discovers that hydrogen can be absorbed by these metals without exhibiting any sensible tension at low temperatures. The author also explores the conditions required for hydrogen to be occluded by metals and how it can be extracted from them. This research contributes to the understanding of metal-hydrogen interactions and the potential applications in metal chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metal Chemistry"}
