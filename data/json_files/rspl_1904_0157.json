They use a transverse section of a steel specimen and apply an electro-deposit of copper to study the boundary line between the metals. The author finds that the steps or serrations in the boundary line are the sectional views of slip-bands, which are features that appear in strained specimens.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Materials Science"}
