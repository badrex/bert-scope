The importance of microporosity in coal for its utilization, such as holding methane underground, transporting coal in slurry form, converting to gaseous and liquid fuels, and using as a precursor of microporous carbons, is also considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
