The authors discuss the influence of an electric field on the distribution of electrons in the lattice and the time it takes for equilibrium to be reached. They also examine the validity of the phenomenological theory of dispersion in metallic conductors and its limitations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
