The authors outline the theory and derive properties of the diffuse reflexions. They then report on their experimental observations of diffuse reflexions in an iron crystal and compare the results with the theoretical predictions. The study provides insights into the interaction between neutrons and phonons in crystal structures and the dynamics of lattices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
