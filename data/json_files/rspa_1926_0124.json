They observed that the salts tend to form a common blade-like or fiber-like structure, regardless of their original crystal habits. This phenomenon is attributed to the influence of the gelation of silicic acid and the structure of the formed gel. The study provides insights into the process of crystal formation and the role of silicic acid gel in altering crystal habits.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
