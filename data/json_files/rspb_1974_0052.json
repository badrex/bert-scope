They identified two distinct types of horizontal cells: neurofilamentous and neurotubular. The study found that the neurofilamentous type had synapses with bipolar cells, while the neurotubular type did not have any synapses. This research is important for understanding the role of horizontal cells in visual processing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
