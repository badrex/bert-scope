They demonstrate that dichromatic isocolour lines either meet at a point representing a missing fundamental sensation or are parallel to a line joining the points representing the two fused sensations. The study concludes that the Young-Helmholtz theory of color vision is fundamentally correct.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Perception"}
