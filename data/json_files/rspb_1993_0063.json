The results show that there is low but detectable gene flow between populations separated by over 1000 km, suggesting that genes from unrelated migrants contribute to genetic diversity in some social groups. This finding has implications for understanding the evolution of social behavior in cooperative breeders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
