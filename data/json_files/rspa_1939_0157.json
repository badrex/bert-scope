The authors used a divided bar apparatus to measure the thermal conductivities of various rock samples and determined the temperature gradients in the earth's crust. They found that the heat flow in Britain and South Africa was lower than previously estimated, and the measurements provided valuable insights into the geothermal energy potential of the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
