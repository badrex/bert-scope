They found that the collision frequency and the number of steady-state doublets were similar to those observed in Couette flow. The results provide insights into suspension rheology and have implications for various problems, including blood flow, latexes, pulp fiber suspensions, and molten polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
