They conducted X-ray measurements and observed that thermal expansion is largest in the direction of hydrogen bonds. The study provides insights into the general theory of phase transitions and the behavior of crystals containing hydrogen bonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
