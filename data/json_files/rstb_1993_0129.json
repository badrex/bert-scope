The structure of CD4's extracellular region, which consists of four domains with sequence similarities to immunoglobulin domains, has been determined by X-ray crystallography. This research helps to understand the function of CD4 in antigen recognition and its importance in health and disease, particularly in relation to HIV.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
