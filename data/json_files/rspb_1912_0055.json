They found that the cornea and lens absorb different wavelengths of light, with the lens absorbing rays between 400mm and 300mm. The vitreous also absorbs certain wavelengths. The author observed histological changes in the lens and ciliary body after exposure to light with a high proportion of short wavelengths, which could lead to damage in the eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
