They develop a theorem that connects the coefficients of a generating function with the coaxial minors of a determinant, providing insights into the structure and properties of these functions. This work contributes to the understanding of generating functions and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
