They discovered that the gas, primarily hydrogen, is driven into the glass due to the bombardment of cathode rays. The authors also found that helium, when introduced into the vacuum tube, is absorbed by the glass, further supporting the idea that gas occlusion is a mechanical process rather than a chemical reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Vacuum Physics"}
