They calculated the energies of various electronic states and found that the lowest state for a neutral vacancy would be a doubly excited state of symmetry. The study provides insights into the physical and chemical properties of irradiated graphite, which is essential for understanding and preventing accidents in nuclear reactors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
