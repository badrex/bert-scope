The authors found that aldehydes have multiple modes of activation, with some modes being more complex and involving energy in remote parts of the molecule. The decomposition rates depend on the structure of the aldehyde and the location of the energy within the molecule. The study provides insights into the factors affecting the rate of aldehyde decomposition reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
