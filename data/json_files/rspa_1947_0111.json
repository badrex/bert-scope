They discovered that the explosion proceeds outward from the point of initiation by two successive, different modes of propagation. The first explosion process is relatively gentle, while the second stage is more violent. The results confirm previous findings and provide more insight into the complex series of events that occur during the explosion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
