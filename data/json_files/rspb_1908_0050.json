The disease was caused by a new species of trypanosome, which was smaller and more delicate than other known species. The disease spread through blood transmission and caused severe swelling, weakness, and eventually death in infected animals. The author conducted experiments to study the disease's effects on various animals and shared their findings with other researchers upon returning to England.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
