The design involves suspending a weight by two parallel wires and twisting the upper ends of the wires to create torsion. The author explains how to calculate the necessary parameters for the design and demonstrates its potential as a gravimeter. The efficiency of this gravimeter depends on the constancy of the torsion, and further research is needed to improve its accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
