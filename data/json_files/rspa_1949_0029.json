They express the geodesic or surface curvatures of these curves in terms of the coordinates and their derivatives. The theory is applied to aerodynamics and dynamical meteorology, providing equations of motion and continuity for these fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
