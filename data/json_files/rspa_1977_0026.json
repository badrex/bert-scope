The research focuses on the effects of curvature and finds that the critical Rayleigh number is qualitatively the same as for the planar model. The motions prevalent at marginal stability occur in the form of a thin cylindrical shell, and the waves drift westward or eastward depending on certain parameters. The results are compared with other studies, including Braginsky's MAC waves and Busse's dynamo model, and argue that the latter may not be representative of planetary magnetism due to convective growth of field associated with convection patterns occurring in the whole sphere rather than in a cylindrical shell.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
