They found that the absorption of \u03b2-rays is influenced by the scattering of the rays and the loss of velocity during their passage through the absorbing medium. The authors also determined the mean deflection experienced by a \u03b2-particle passing through a material and provided a mathematical relationship to calculate the number of corpuscles in an atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
