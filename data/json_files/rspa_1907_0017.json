They found that the negative leak from lime was much greater than that from calcium. The experiments showed that the presence of the electro-negative oxygen atom in the lime molecule acts as an attracting force, retaining the escaping corpuscles. The authors also discussed the connection between the large emissions of negative corpuscles in metallic oxides and their glowing property when heated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
