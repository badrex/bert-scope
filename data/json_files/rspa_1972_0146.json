They used simple interatomic force models to analyze the deformation modes and found a marked anisotropy in the ideal tensile strength of sodium chloride, with a minimum on a specific plane. The ideal tensile strength of argon was less dependent on orientation, which aligns with the lack of a clear cleavage plane in the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
