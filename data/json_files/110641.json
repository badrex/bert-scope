He found that nitrogen plays a crucial role in both processes, and that the chemical action of vegetable matter can be changed by exciting an action in other vegetable matter. Rigg also observed that the decomposition of vegetable matter is highly noxious and that certain insects consume plants with large quantities of nitrogen, suggesting a harmonious connection between all parts of the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
