The author used a chronograph and various types of shot to measure the time taken to pass through screens and the velocities at the middle points between screens. The results were used to analyze the resistance of the air to the motion of projectiles and compare them with previous findings by M. Helie.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
