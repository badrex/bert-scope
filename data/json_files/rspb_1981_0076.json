The structure shows that the octamer forms a classical A-DNA type observed for the first time in a single crystal containing both A-T and G base pairs. The findings have implications for understanding gene control regions and the way function is governed by secondary structure in DNA.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
