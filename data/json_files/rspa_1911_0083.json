The author examines the relationship between the current and the potential difference between the electrodes, considering the effects of ionization, electric forces, and varying pressures. The study provides equations and relations for calculating the variables involved in the conductivity of gases, with a focus on air at atmospheric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
