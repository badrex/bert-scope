The spearhead was discovered when a rattling noise was heard inside the tusk. It is believed that the spear entered the elephant's trunk between its eye and its proboscis, and the animal lived for a considerable time after receiving the wound.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
