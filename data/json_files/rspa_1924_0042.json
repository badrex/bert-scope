This technique allowed for the removal of coking properties without using pyridine, which has a depolymerizing effect on coal. The process improved the extraction efficiency and eliminated the need for complex apparatuses used in previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
