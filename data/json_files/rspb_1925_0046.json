The research shows that freezing and thawing processes can cause changes in the structure and properties of egg components. The critical temperature range for these changes is between -1\u00b0C and -3\u00b0C. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of biological materials under low-temperature conditions and for the preservation of eggs and other perishable food items.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
