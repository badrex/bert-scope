They show that the appropriate boundary conditions include certain physical and geometrical effects to the first order in the layer thickness, and they test these conditions against the exact solution for a circular layer and compare them to the spring contact model.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
