It also investigates the excitation and emission in the nitrogen band spectrum, finding that the relative intensities of the bands are not affected by the energy of the exciting electrons. The results support the view that the final product of protactinium's radioactive disintegration is the lead isotope of mass 207.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
