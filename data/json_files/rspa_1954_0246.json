Both methods avoid the difficulties encountered in the conventional method, providing a simpler approach for non-empirical calculations on complex systems. The electrostatic method focuses on the forces acting on the nuclei of a molecule, resulting in a direct calculation of binding energies and other molecular properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
