He describes the comet's appearance, movement, and the process of determining its place in the sky. He also examines the changes in brightness of the variable star in the neck of the Whale (o Ceti) and compares different observations made by other astronomers. Additionally, he mentions the disappearance of a star in the constellation Hercules and the lunar eclipse observed in October 1790."}
