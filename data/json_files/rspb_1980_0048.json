They found that dominance was present for both characters and that dominant alleles were generally present at higher frequencies than their recessive counterparts. The results suggest that this type of genetic architecture is expected for characters under stabilizing selection, with the phenotype of maximum dominance being the optimal phenotype towards which selection has been acting.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
