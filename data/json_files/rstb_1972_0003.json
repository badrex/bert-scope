The study reveals diverse biotopes and suggests that the climate during the Flandrian period was at least as warm as today, potentially even warmer. The research provides valuable insights into the environmental conditions of the past and their implications for the present and future.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
