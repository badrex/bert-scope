He examines the laws of collision for three types of bodies: perfectly elastic, perfectly unelastic and soft, and perfectly unelastic and hard. Smeaton challenges the assumption that the velocity after collision is the same for non-elastic hard and soft bodies, and provides evidence through experiments on mills to support his findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
