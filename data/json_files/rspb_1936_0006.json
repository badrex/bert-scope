They found that the respiratory cardiac arrhythmia is mainly due to a decrease in vagus tone during inspiration. The central mechanism is closely related to the respiratory center and can be influenced by factors such as carbon dioxide tension in the blood and blood pressure. The authors also investigated the role of the sympathetic fibers in the respiratory arrhythmia and found that they usually have little effect on the central respiratory arrhythmia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
