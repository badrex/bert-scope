They found that the marked P element could transpose autonomously and examined the pattern of poly(A)+ transcripts encoded by P elements. The study aimed to dissect the functions encoded by P elements and understand their roles in gene expression and regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
