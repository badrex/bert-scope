The authors found that the low melting points are due to the contribution of association complexes in the melt, which increase the entropy of fusion without requiring large heat or volume changes. The experiments also showed marked homophase premelting in solid potassium thiocyanate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
