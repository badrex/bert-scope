They found that feeding rats with thyroid gland significantly reduced the glycogen content in their livers, indicating a direct impact on carbohydrate metabolism. The authors also observed that thyroid feeding affected nitrogen distribution in the urine, but the exact relationship between thyroid hormone and nitrogen metabolism remains uncertain. These findings highlight the complex and variable effects of thyroid hormone on metabolism in the normal organism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
