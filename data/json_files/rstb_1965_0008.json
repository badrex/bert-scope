It identifies four distinct regions in the inferior frontal system, including the posterior buccal lobes, which serve as the center of the system. The study reveals that the inferior frontal system is involved in regulating arm actions, feeding activities, and has connections with the visual system. The organization of the system allows for reflex responses to simple stimuli and responses to complex patterns of inputs, making it essential for the octopus's ability to learn and adapt to its environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
