The author focuses on the role of polyunsaturated fatty acids, particularly the n-3 family, in modulating platelet behavior. The study of Greenland Eskimos, who consume a diet rich in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), reveals a lower incidence of ischaemic heart disease. The author demonstrates that EPA has an anti-aggregatory effect on platelets and suggests that dietary factors can influence platelet-vessel wall interaction, which should be considered in dietary advice to reduce the incidence of ischaemic heart diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nutrition and Dietetics"}
