They used reversed-phase partition film chromatography to isolate and identify the individual components. The results showed that the lipids consisted of even-numbered carbon chains, ranging from dodecanoic to tetracosanoic acid for the acids and from dodecanol to octacosanol for the alcohols. The main component of the ester-alcohols was hexacosanol, and the ester-acids contained dodecanoic, tetradecanoic, octadecanoic, docosanoic, and tetracosanoic acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
