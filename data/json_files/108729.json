The liquid carbonic acid is found to be a strong insulator of electricity and a chemically inert body with limited solubility for certain substances. This research contributes to the understanding of carbonic acid's behavior and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry and Chemical Reactions"}
