The Mahonia plant hosts a specific fungus that is part of the life-cycle of Puccinia graminis, making it a potential source of the mildew. This finding helps explain the widespread nature of wheat mildew outbreaks in areas where the common barberry is rare or absent.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
