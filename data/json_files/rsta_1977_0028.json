It explains how precise tracking of satellites can help determine the relative positions of points on Earth's surface. The authors describe the latest results using dynamic methods and propose experiments using both dynamic and geometric methods on the Lageos satellite. They also discuss the San Andreas Fault Experiment, which aims to measure the motion along the fault in California by measuring the change in distance between sites on opposite sides of the fault.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
