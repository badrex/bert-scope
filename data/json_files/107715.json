They discover that the apparent direction of the eyes is not solely determined by the shape of the iris but is also influenced by the position of the facial features. The author demonstrates this through various experiments with portraits, showing how the turn of the face can alter the apparent direction of the eyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Art and Humanities > Art and Perception"}
