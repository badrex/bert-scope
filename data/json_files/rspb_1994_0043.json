They found that the aragonite tablets in Atrina shells have a concave shape with elongate rings that mimic the unit cell orientation, while Haliotis shells have flatter tablets with central depressions aligning between nacreous layers. The study provides insights into the structure and organization of nacre, which could help understand shell formation and biomineralization processes."}
