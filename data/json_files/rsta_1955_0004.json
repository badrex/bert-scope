The author examines the distant field, average pressure amplitude, and scattering coefficient for different angles of incidence and boundary conditions, providing valuable insights into the behavior of waves interacting with cylindrical obstacles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism and Waves"}
