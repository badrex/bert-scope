The authors develop a mechanical model to study the behavior of dampers under various conditions, including sliding friction and stiction. They analyze the influence of supporting angles and centrifugal forces on the damper's performance and provide a comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Systems"}
