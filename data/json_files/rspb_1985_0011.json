The research shows that replacing chloride with nitrate in the external environment causes a net gain of sodium in red blood cells, which is insensitive to ouabain and sensitive to furosemide. This finding sheds light on the role of furosemide in regulating sodium transport in red blood cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
