They determined the neutron flux by intercepting both neutrons and alpha particles over a large solid angle and estimating the integrated alpha particle flux in terms of the volume of helium gas formed. The study aimed to establish accurate cross sections for these reactions, which can be used as reference reactions in nuclear physics research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
