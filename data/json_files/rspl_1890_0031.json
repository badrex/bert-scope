They developed a method to accurately graduate these thermometers without using an air thermometer and found that the results from different thermometers were in practical agreement. This research contributed to the accurate measurement of temperatures up to about 500\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
