They found that most of the shocks were highly local in origin, with foci likely located under the island. The author also discussed the challenges in determining the location of the earthquake foci and the relationship between seismic activity and other factors like rainfall, barometric pressure, lunar, and solar gravitational influences.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
