The linearized equations reveal discontinuities and singular surfaces within the fluid, which are influenced by the container's dimensions and rotation speeds. The research confirms that inviscid solutions are accurate approximations for high Reynolds numbers, and the findings have implications for understanding fluid dynamics and large-scale oceanic circulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
