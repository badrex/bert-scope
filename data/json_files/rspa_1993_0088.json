The authors demonstrate the feasibility of determining triplet phases of macromolecular structures, which can support the solution of large molecule structures using Direct Methods. They also discuss the challenges encountered when applying this method to large proteins, such as weaker scattering power, increased overlap of multiple-beam interference effects, and higher sensitivity to radiation damage.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
