The authors argue against the idea that sea floor spreading and plate tectonics alone can explain the structural evolution of a region. They present evidence from the Atlas Mountains of Morocco and the eastern North American and northwest African continental margins, emphasizing the importance of considering the whole geological environment and history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
