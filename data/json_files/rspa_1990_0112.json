The theory is based on a set of nonlinear ordinary differential equations and involves a topological constraint that all residue curve maps for four-component reactive mixtures must obey. This approach allows for a better understanding of the global properties of phase equilibria and can aid in process synthesis, design, and simulation for complex separations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Engineering"}
