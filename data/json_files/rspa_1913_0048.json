They found that the presence of oxygen is essential for the disintegration of most metals, and that the volatility of metals at temperatures below their melting points is a common phenomenon. The experiments were conducted using nitrogen gas, which is chemically inert to most metals, and the temperatures were measured using an optical pyrometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
