The research reveals that despite their different external shapes, the sensory epithelium of the osphradium in both families is very similar. This finding conflicts with previous classifications that separate the two families. Based on osphradial characters and additional anatomical features, the study suggests that both families are outside the Prosobranchia and represent the common basal level for Opisthobranchia and Pulmonata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
