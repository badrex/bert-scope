It was found that total dislocations with Burgers vectors were dissociated into Shockley partial dislocations with a separation of nm for the pure edge orientation and nm for the pure screw orientation. The intrinsic stacking-fault energy was calculated using anisotropic elasticity theory. The method also allowed imaging of partial dislocations at threefold dislocation nodes in silicon, which were all found to be extended.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
