The authors found that the radiation from a clear blue sky generally has a higher luminous efficiency than sunlight. They also investigated the use of a green gelatine filter to reduce the response of the Weston selenium cell to better align with the human eye's sensitivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
