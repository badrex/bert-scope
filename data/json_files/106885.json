He discovered a fibrous structure in the crystalline humor, which had been observed before by Leuwenhoek, but Hunter's contribution was to provide a detailed description of its structure and its potential role in the eye's ability to adjust focus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
