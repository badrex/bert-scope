Miller discovered a new star in Corona Borealis with a unique spectrum. The star's light was found to be a mix of two different sources, with one being a solid or liquid photosphere similar to the sun and the other being luminous gas. The gaseous spectrum showed bright lines, suggesting that the gas might be mainly hydrogen. This discovery led to the speculation that hydrogen may play a significant role in the differences between star groups and their changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Stellar Spectroscopy"}
