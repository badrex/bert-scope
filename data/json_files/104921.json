He argues that the table cannot be used properly for ages above 20 due to the influx of strangers and the lack of accurate birth records. Brakenridge suggests finding an inland town or a group of contiguous parishes to maintain a more accurate register of births and deaths.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Demography"}
