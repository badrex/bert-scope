The authors consider generalized temperature and concentration dependencies of reaction rates and examine the role of diffusion. They provide numerical results for the time taken by a system to ignite or reach a maximum temperature, with simple asymptotic formulae given for important limiting cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
