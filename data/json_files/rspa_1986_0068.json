They find that crossing of eigenvalues is rare and typically unfolds into an avoided crossing or a bubble of instability, depending on the signatures of the eigenvalues. A new superharmonic instability is predicted and verified. This research helps to understand the behavior of water waves and their stability under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
