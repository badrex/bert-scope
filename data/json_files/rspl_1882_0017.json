The device uses an electrical resistance coil lowered into the water and connected to a Wheatstone bridge. The results of experiments conducted on board the United States Coast and Geodetic Survey steamer \"Blake\" show that the electrical thermometer can accurately measure oceanic temperatures at various depths.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
