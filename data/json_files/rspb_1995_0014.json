The research measures asymmetries in the forceps and elytra of 30 earwig genera and concludes that fluctuating asymmetry values are not greater in the forceps than the elytra, as previously predicted. The overall relation between forceps length and fluctuating asymmetry is flat, suggesting that forceps are not condition-dependent traits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Evolutionary Biology"}
