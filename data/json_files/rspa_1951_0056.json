They determined the vapor pressures, latent heats of vaporization, and densities of these compounds and analyzed the rate of evaporation of droplets. The results provide insights into molecular configurations and thermodynamic data for these substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
