The study focuses on the skull, forelimb, pectoral girdle, hindlimb, pelvic girdle, and axial skeleton, offering insights into the animal's movements, feeding habits, and possible ecological role. The findings suggest that Dicynodon trigonocephalus was a slow-moving herbivore capable of sustained locomotion and adapted to exploit tough and bulky food sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
