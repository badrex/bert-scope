It highlights the importance of understanding the underlying dynamics and the limitations of long-term predictability in complex systems. The authors also introduce methods for characterizing nonlinearity and analyzing multiple short time series with composite attractors.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Time Series Analysis"}
