The author focuses on the large-k asymptotics and the optimal choice of asymptotic representation for the subdominant multiplier, which takes a simple form as a universal function of a natural variable describing the crossing of the line. This result is obtained without resumming divergent series, and it applies to various fields, including diffraction integrals and catastrophe optics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
