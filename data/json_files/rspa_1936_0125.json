They found that the crystal behaves like an ideal gas of independent particles, but to obtain a finite heat conductivity, a mean free path for the particles must be introduced. The study provides insights into the thermal properties of materials and the interactions between their spin systems and lattice vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
