They focus on invariants involving two independent variables and provide properties of these invariants, such as their symmetry and the forms of the simultaneous linear partial differential equations they satisfy. The author also discusses connections between functional invariants and binary forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
