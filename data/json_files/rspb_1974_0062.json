The cirri consist of 22-26 pairs of cilia arranged in two parallel rows and have a unique bending and branching pattern that forms a mesh between cirri and gill filaments. This structure allows for efficient filtering and retention of particles in the mussel's gill.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
