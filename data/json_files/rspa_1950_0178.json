They explored various scenarios, including a point source in an infinite homogeneous medium, a semi-infinite medium with a plane face, and an empty sphere around the point source. The results provide insights into the behavior of gamma-radiation in radiography and other applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
