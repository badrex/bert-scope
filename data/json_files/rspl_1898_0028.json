They found that the hybrid larvae's characteristics depend on the relative degrees of maturity of the sexual products. The study also showed variations in the capacity for cross-fertilization due to seasonal changes in the maturity of sexual products.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinodermatology"}
