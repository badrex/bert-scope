It presents examples of krill conservation in the southern ocean and predicting the spread and intensity of pest infestations, such as fruit flies. The author introduces the concept of the structure function, which summarizes global information in a local format, to help predict how organisms respond to spatial patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Spatial Ecology"}
