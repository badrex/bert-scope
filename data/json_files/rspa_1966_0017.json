They found that the carbon-carbon bond lengths vary in different parts of the molecule and confirmed the accuracy of previous two-dimensional measurements. The study provides a better understanding of the structure and properties of coronene, an aromatic hydrocarbon with potential applications in materials science and chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
