This glial spike can alter the neuronal microenvironment and trigger neuronal depolarization, while being facilitated by neuronally released agents. The propagation mechanism of spreading depression is proposed to be a wave of intracellular Ca2+-induced Ca2+ release (cytocal wave) traveling through the glial compartment. This theory could lead to a better understanding and management of migraine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurology"}
