They discovered that certain substances, such as calcined metals and ashes, can change from conductors to non-conductors when transformed into powders or exposed to heat. This finding sheds light on the complex nature of electricity and the properties of different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
