They discovered phenylmercaptan and phenylene sulfide, two new sulfur compounds. Phenylmercaptan is a colorless oil with an aromatic odor, while phenylene sulfide forms crystalline substances. The author also investigated the reactions of these compounds with various reagents, such as sulfuric acid and lead acetate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
