The research discusses the variations in salinity, calculates mean values, and investigates the correlation between salinities at different stations and the impact of rainfall and barometric gradients. The findings provide insights into the mean currents of the sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
