They investigated the methods of obtaining ova, embryos, and Nauplii, as well as the seasons when these stages can be found. The author found a great uniformity in the development of different forms and confirmed previous work on certain points while establishing new facts that reconciled seemingly discordant opinions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
