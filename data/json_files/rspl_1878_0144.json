They find that most species have limited geographical ranges and are primarily found in tropical and temperate zones. The author also discusses the rarity of Comatulids in deep-sea environments and compares their distribution to that of other crinoid species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
