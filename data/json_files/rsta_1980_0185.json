The authors study the 21 cm line to understand the distribution of hydrogen gas in groups of galaxies and its relationship to galaxy formation. They also discuss the importance of tidal interactions in creating extended filaments and clouds of gas, which contribute to the formation of galaxy structures. The authors conclude that intergalactic gas plays a significant role in the mass distribution and evolution of galaxy groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Galaxy Formation and Evolution"}
