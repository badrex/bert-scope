They describe the neuron columns as having a diameter of 200-300 micrometers and discuss the role of specific inhibitory and excitatory interneurons in the neuron network. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the connectivity and architectonics of the cerebral cortex for understanding higher neural functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
