They analyze the Ballyduff and Newtownlow esker systems and conclude that the formation of these landforms is inconsistent with the glacial river theory. Instead, the author suggests that the material was accumulated from the adjacent front of a melting ice sheet and deposited by sheets of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
