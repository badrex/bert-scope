Englefield reported on the unusual soil and fossil findings discovered while digging a well at Hanby in Lincolnshire. The soil was a blue clay containing casts of tellinae, pyrites, and belemnites. A unique aspect was the presence of nodules of pure chalk interspersed throughout the clay, ranging in size from a pea to a child's head. This phenomenon was not observed in the surrounding area.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
