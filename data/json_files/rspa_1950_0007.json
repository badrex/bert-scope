The authors derive a general equation that determines the relationship between stress, strain, and concentration in a swollen polymer network. They also explore specific cases, such as tensile stress and inflation, and compare the equilibrium swelling behavior under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
