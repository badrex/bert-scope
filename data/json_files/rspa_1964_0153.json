They discovered that these embryos form in the cooled, supersaturated gas and play a crucial role in the condensation process. The study provides insights into the behavior of condensation nuclei and highlights interesting features of the condensation process through mass spectra analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas Dynamics"}
