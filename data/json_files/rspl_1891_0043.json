They observe that the arytenoid cartilages move inward and forward to close the larynx, while the epiglottis does not actively participate in the closure. This process prevents food particles from entering the lower respiratory tract during swallowing. The author also discusses the observations made by other laryngologists, confirming the mechanism of larynx closure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
