He discovered its method of reproduction and provided suggestions for controlling its population. The Wolf Worm transforms into a moth that lays eggs in the crevices of grain, and the larvae hatch to continue the cycle of destruction. Van Leuwenhock proposed using smoke from burning sulfur to eliminate the moths and prevent future infestations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
