He discovers that the magnetical pyrites are composed of sulfur and iron in specific proportions and that these properties are different from those of common martial pyrites. Hatchett also discusses the relationship between the magnetic properties of these substances and their chemical composition, as well as the potential applications of these findings in creating stronger artificial magnets.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
