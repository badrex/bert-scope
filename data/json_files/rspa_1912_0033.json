They used selective absorption of black fluorspar and water to analyze the radiation and ensure accuracy. However, the non-portable design, low light intensity, and unsatisfactory color led to the conclusion that this standard may not be practical for widespread use.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
