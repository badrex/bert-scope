The study found that compatible pollinations showed increased growth rates with increased temperature, while incompatible pollinations had an optimum growth rate between 15-20\u00b0C. The results suggest that temperature differences can affect self-incompatibility in plants, and the mechanisms behind this are related to immunity reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
