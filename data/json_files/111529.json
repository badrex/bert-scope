Hofmann, conducted research on phosphorus-bases and discovered a new group of compounds containing nitrogen and phosphorus, which he called phosphamines. He synthesized a phosphoretted urea, a compound similar to urea but with phosphorus replacing one equivalent of nitrogen. This new compound, called cyanurate of phenyl, has potential applications in the field of organic chemistry and crystallography.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
