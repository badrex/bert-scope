It highlights that while the recorded extinction rates are relatively low, the percentage of threatened plant taxa is significantly higher, indicating a potential catastrophic scale of future extinctions. The author suggests that aiming for the rescue of every endangered species in the Mediterranean region is a realistic and ambitious goal.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biodiversity Conservation"}
