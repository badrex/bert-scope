They approach the radiation problem using a convolution principle and analyze the behavior of the radiation field, eventually leading to a purely pulsatory steady state. The study includes applications to vibrating elastic plates and internal gravity waves in Boussinesq fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave Propagation"}
