Through a series of experiments, he confirmed that this body is indeed ozone. He demonstrated this by observing the oxidation of mercury, the reaction with test-paper, and the effect of heat on the atmospheric gas. These findings support the identity of ozone in the atmosphere and its role in the decomposition of iodide of potassium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
