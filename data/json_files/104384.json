Through a series of experiments, he determines that the water contains a neutral salt and a soluble alkaline earth. Senckenberg also investigates the water's bitterness, attributing it to the presence of alkaline earth. The study provides a method for examining mineral waters in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
