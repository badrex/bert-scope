The author highlights the properties of B.t., its mode of action, and the genetic manipulation of the bacterium to increase its effectiveness. Despite the advantages of using these pathogens, more research is needed to understand their long-term impact on insect populations and the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
