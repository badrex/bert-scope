He discovered that the suspension is due to the balance of atmospheric pressure and the cohesive force of the liquid column. The experiments also demonstrated that capillary action works in a vacuum, and the author proposed a theory based on the attraction between the particles of water and glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
