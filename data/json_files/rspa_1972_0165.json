They studied the g-factor of the neck orbits in noble metals and found a large g-shift from the free electron value in potassium, which they attributed to many-body effects. This technique allowed them to determine the anisotropy of the local g-factor over the Fermi surface and provided a value for the Landau coefficient in potassium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
