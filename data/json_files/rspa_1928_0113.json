They found that the efficiency of these metals as photoelectric detectors varied, with nickel and iron being the most efficient, followed by cobalt and copper. The results showed that the photoelectric efficiency is related to the soft-ray production of the tested metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
