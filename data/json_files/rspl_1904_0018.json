They discovered that the restricted powers of infection, characteristic of \"biologic forms,\" can break down when the vitality of the host-leaf is interfered with. This research suggests that injuries to leaves, caused by natural factors, may render the injured leaf susceptible to a fungus otherwise unable to infect it. The authors also explored the concept of chemotaxis in fungal infection, showing that certain substances in plant cell-sap can attract or repel fungal germ-tubes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
