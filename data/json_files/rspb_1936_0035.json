The author discusses the factors that influence the female wasp's ability to choose the correct host for its offspring's development, including shape, size, and physico-chemical properties of the host. The research also explores the controversy surrounding the role of instinct and tropic responses in host selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
