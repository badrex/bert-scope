F. Baxter conducted experiments to determine if signs of current electricity are present in plants during vegetation. Baxter found that electric currents exist in the leaves and roots of plants, and these currents are connected to the vital changes that occur in these organs. This research built upon previous work by Becquerel and Wartmann, who had already demonstrated that electric currents can be obtained in various parts of plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
