It highlights the importance of understanding the electronic basis of rotatory dispersion and circular dichroism in disymmetric molecules and complex ions. The techniques of circular dichroism and optical rotatory dispersion have great value in determining the absolute configurations of molecules, relative stereochemistry, and studying conformational effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
