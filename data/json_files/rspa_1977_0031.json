The authors provide evidence for the existence of both negative and positive charges at the interface and propose a model that explains the conflicting reports on the value of minimum metallic conductivity. They suggest that in a two-dimensional system, long-range potential fluctuations increase the minimum metallic conductivity above the value predicted for short-range potential fluctuations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
