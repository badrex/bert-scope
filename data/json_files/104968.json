The author, Robert Dingley, and others observed that the water level was much lower than expected, and the flood came and went unexpectedly. They attributed this to weak floods, yellow-colored water, and possible wind shifts. This phenomenon was significant because it affected shipping and other activities along the river.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
