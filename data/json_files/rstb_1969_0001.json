The study reveals an elaborate system of tissue spaces throughout the neuropil and around larger nerve cell bodies, which communicate with a well-developed closed venous system. These channels help in the circulation and nourishment of the nervous tissue in cephalopods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
