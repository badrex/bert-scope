According to the theory, interstellar material, consisting of fragments called 'floccules,' moves randomly and forms many stars simultaneously. The solar system was formed in a region with a specific radius, accounting for the amount of material and angular momentum within it. This process explains the mass, size, and number-density of planets in the solar system, as well as the sun's angular momentum and axial rotation."}
