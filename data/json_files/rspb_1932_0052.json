They found that certain volatile substances, like acetaldehyde, can significantly affect the growth rate of mould fungi, with different effects on germination, growth, and colony size. This research has practical implications for food preservation and storage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
