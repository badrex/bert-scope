The authors use the voltage-clamp technique to study the movement of charged groups in the membrane and their relation to calcium release. They find that charge movements may be part of a trigger mechanism for muscle contraction and that the movement of charged groups follows a Boltzmann relation. The authors also explore the localization of charge movements and their connection to excitation-contraction coupling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
