It explores inter- and intra-unit interactions, including electron transfer and localization, and the role of secondary factors such as electron-phonon couplings and electron-electron repulsions. The article highlights the complexity and variety of these compounds, leading to various crossover regimes and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
