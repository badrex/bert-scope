The results show that wind exposure stunts seedling growth, reduces water content, and inhibits root hair development. The author suggests that the stunting effect is due to a combination of unfavorable wetting and increased cooling, which may rob the growing point of heat needed for growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Biology"}
