The results show that introduced male genes spread more extensively than maternally inherited genes, suggesting that sexual selection plays a role in gene flow. This research has implications for understanding the genetic structure of populations and the reintroduction of endangered mammals into wild populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
