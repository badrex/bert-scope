They used a thermocouple to measure the temperature and developed a method suitable for small quantities of rare metals. The results showed that the liquidus and solidus curves fell more steeply with increasing valency of the solute, and the extent of the solid solution became less. This research helped improve the understanding of alloy chemistry and the behavior of metals in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy chemistry"}
