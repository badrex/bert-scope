The table shows the annual variation or semiannual inequality to which the magnet's declination is subject. The author, Senhor Da Silveira, is the Superintendent of the Lisbon Observatory, and the table confirms the annual variation of the magnet's declination, with the north end of the magnet pointing more towards the East when the sun is north of the Equator and more towards the West when the sun is south of the Equator.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
