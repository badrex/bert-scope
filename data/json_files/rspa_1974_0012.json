They observed these dislocations in ultrasonic wave trains reflected from rough surfaces and explained their detailed structure and properties. Dislocations in wave trains can move, intersect, and interact, making them a significant feature in wave interference and scattering problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
