He highlights the importance of their traditional sour cabbage, quass (a fermented rye and malt drink), and other dishes in maintaining good health. Guthrie believes that understanding and adopting these practices could benefit the British navy's antiscorbutic regimen.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Human Ecology"}
