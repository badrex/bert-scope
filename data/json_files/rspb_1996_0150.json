The researchers found no evidence to support this prediction, suggesting that females may not have sufficient physiological control over offspring sex or that the mechanisms for manipulating sex ratio are not finely tuned. The findings challenge previous studies on female control over offspring sex and paternity in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
