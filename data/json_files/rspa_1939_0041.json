The authors find that the film's heat transport is primarily due to mass flow from cold to warm areas, rather than through conduction. They also study the film's thickness and its effect on the transfer rate, discovering that the film's properties are complex and require further study.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
