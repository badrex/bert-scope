The author discusses the Hamiltonian systems with two degrees of freedom and the importance of resonance parameters in determining the topology of phase space. The study focuses on the existence and stability of bifurcations in these systems, providing insights into the behavior of galaxies and their dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics and Astronomy"}
