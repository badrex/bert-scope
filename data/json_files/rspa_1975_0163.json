X-ray interferometers have contributed to the understanding of fundamental constants, Bragg reflexion, crystal defects, and optical constants. The author describes the operation of these instruments using an optical analogue and explores their potential in interferometric spectroscopy and other applications. The lecture also highlights the importance of high-intensity tunable X-ray sources for future advancements in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
