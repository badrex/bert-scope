These fluids have different systems, conduits, and functions within the organisms. The author also found that the presence and development of these fluids are inversely proportional in different classes of invertebrates. This research helps establish a better understanding of the classification and characteristics of invertebrate animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
