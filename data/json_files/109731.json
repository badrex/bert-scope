He found that alcohol is present in fermented liquors and analyzed the alcohol content in various types of wine and other liquors. The author also tested different methods to separate alcohol, such as distillation, temperature variation, and freezing, but found that these methods were not effective in proving the presence of alcohol in fermented liquors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alcohol Chemistry"}
