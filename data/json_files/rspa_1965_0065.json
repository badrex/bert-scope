The authors develop constitutive equations for these materials, considering both space differential and space functional types. They also discuss the restrictions on the form of these equations due to material symmetry and establish relations between different types of non-simple fluids. The study provides a foundation for understanding and analyzing complex materials and their behavior under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
