The authors explore various methods, including global and local singular value decompositions, to analyze the data and determine if a low-dimensional representation is feasible. They conclude that a low-dimensional characterization of the temperature data is unlikely, highlighting the challenges in understanding and predicting weather and climate systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
