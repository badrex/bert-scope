The authors explore various surface interactions, including bond cleavage, chemical specificity, and the role of surface defects and redox states in catalytic activity. Examples are provided to illustrate the diverse information now possible from photoelectron spectroscopy, with applications in complex chemisorption, synergistic chemistry of coadsorbed molecules, oxygen chemisorption, and surface halogenation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
