They study the effects of different concentrations of virus and the addition of substances that may reduce the number of lesions formed. The results help determine whether the substances act on the virus agent itself or the host tissues, providing insights into the nature of the virus and its interaction with plant materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
