Faraday, explores new compounds of carbon and hydrogen formed during the decomposition of oil by heat. He discovers a new compound, bi-carburet of hydrogen, which is a colorless, transparent liquid with an odor resembling oil gas and almonds. This substance has various properties and reactions, including being slightly soluble in water, very soluble in oils and ethers, and burning with a bright flame.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
