The research aims to test the meteoritic hypothesis, which suggests that celestial bodies are or have been swarms of meteorites. The study provides a new classification of celestial bodies based on their spectra, revealing the differences in temperature and physical conditions of various stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
