He discovered different types of units in the retina that corresponded to the colors blue, green, and red, and established that color vision in vertebrates depends on three separate channels. Granit's work laid the foundation for modern vision research and earned him a Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1967.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
