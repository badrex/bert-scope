They compare the accuracy of different instruments, such as Daniel's hygrometer and the dry-and wet-bulb thermometers, and find that Mr. Glaisher's tables, based on Greenwich hygrometrical observations, provide accurate results. The author concludes that these tables can be used by anyone, even those without scientific knowledge, making them a valuable tool in meteorology and climate science.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
