They identified 856 lines and determined the wavelengths and probable origins of various elements, including hydrogen, helium, calcium, iron, and manganese. The study provided insights into the composition and structure of the solar chromosphere and corona, as well as the differences between the flash spectrum and the Fraunhofer spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
