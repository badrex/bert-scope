They suggest that faster lightning leaders are driven by an over-voltage created by discharges in the cloud before the visible part of the leader emerges below the cloud. The authors tested various electrode arrangements and impulse sparkover voltages to observe the differences in behavior as leader-stroke velocities increased, which could help improve understanding of lightning currents and their effects on transmission lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
