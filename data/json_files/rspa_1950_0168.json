They found that a crystallographic electric field of trigonal symmetry adequately explains the positions and intensities of the absorption lines in the spectrum. The observed widths of the absorption lines correspond closely with those calculated from magnetic dipole interaction. This study provides a detailed comparison between theory and experiment, with good overall agreement, particularly in rubidium, cesium, and sodium alums."}
