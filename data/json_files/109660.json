The results showed that the spleen is sometimes distended and colored when the stomach contains fluids, such as tincture of rhubarb. This indicates that the spleen absorbs fluids directly from the stomach, bypassing the ordinary circulation. However, when the stomach is empty, no evidence of the rhubarb coloring is found in the spleen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
