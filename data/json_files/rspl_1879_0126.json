They observed that at the critical point, the liquid and gas have the same specific gravity and refractive indices. The author also discovered that liquids above their critical points are not uniformly compressible and proposed methods to prevent or delay the mixing of gas and liquid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
