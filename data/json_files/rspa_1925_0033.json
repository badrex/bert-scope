They found conditions under which the arc spectrum appears without any trace of the spark lines. The study provides insights into the behavior of nitrogen and helium spectra under various conditions, contributing to the understanding of atomic and molecular spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
