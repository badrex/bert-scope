He discovered that factors such as gravitation, motion, capillary attraction, and the structure of the vessels contribute to the descent of sap. The author also observed that the form and growth of trees are influenced by their environment, such as exposure to wind and proximity to other trees.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
