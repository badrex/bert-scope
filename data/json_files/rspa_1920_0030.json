They used a closed circuit of liquid with a horizontal capillary tube and vertical tubes, filled with mercury and the liquid under test. The method allowed them to determine the absolute kinematic viscosity of the fluid under constant pressure differences. The research was conducted for the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to analyze the efficiency of power transmission through worm gears with different lubricants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
