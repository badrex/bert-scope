The researchers found that a bright light source can negatively impact visual perception, particularly in peripheral vision. They also discovered that the glare effect can be mitigated by adjusting the brightness of the surrounding environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Visual Perception"}
