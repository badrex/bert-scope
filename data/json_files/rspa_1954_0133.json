They found that the first two anhydrides polymerize at rates dependent on monomer and initiator concentrations, while the sarcosine derivative has a different reaction rate. The authors propose a reaction scheme involving the formation of a complex between the monomer and a base, followed by decomposition with the evolution of carbon dioxide. This mechanism explains the observed kinetics and the role of catalysts in the polymerization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
