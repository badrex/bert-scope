It explains how inorganic sulphate is transported into cells and activated by ATP sulphurylase, an enzyme that has been studied by kinetic and stereochemical methods. The author also describes the synthesis and stereochemical analysis of chiral [160,170,180]sulphate esters and the stereochemical course of an aryl sulphotransferase from Aspergillus oryzae.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
