They used this apparatus to investigate the degradation of polymethyl methacrylate, focusing on the evolution of monomer, the average size of residual polymer molecules, and the number of bonds broken during the reaction. This research provided valuable insights into the degradation process of vinyl polymers and the factors affecting it.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
