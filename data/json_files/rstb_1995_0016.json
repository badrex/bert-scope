Two phases of glycogen accumulation are detected, with phase I occurring in hyphae at the air-agar interface region and phase II in aerial hyphal tips during sporulation. The findings suggest that glycogen synthesis and degradation may play a role in morphogenesis by influencing turgor pressure and that glycogen could be a major sink for carbon stored during sporulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
