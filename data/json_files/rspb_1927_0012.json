The results show that injections of follicular extract cause the development of a stratified vaginal epithelium, similar to that observed during oestrus. The study also highlights the impact of these hormones on the uterus, causing congestion and glandular growth. However, the injections did not affect the follicular system of the ovary in the anoestrous bitches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
