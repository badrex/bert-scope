These novel cell lines can be used to study mechanisms involved in nociceptor activation and the regulation of sensory-neuron specific markers, including neuropeptides, providing a better understanding of pain and potential treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
