They found that the nature of the gas surrounding the electrodes influences the spectra, and the continuous spectrum is strongest when the electrodes are immersed in hydrogen or nitrogen. The continuous rays are not caused by the emissive power of any incandescent oxide, either gaseous or solid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
