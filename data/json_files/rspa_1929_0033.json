They used a magnesium arc in hydrogen at low pressure to produce the spectrum and found that the band has an and -branch with the and branches being much stronger. The authors also observed a rapid decline in intensity in the and branches after passing the maximum value. The study provides insights into the molecular and atomic electronic energy levels of the MgIH molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
