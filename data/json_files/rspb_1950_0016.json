The author explains the role of actomyosin in muscle contraction and the importance of ATP in muscle protein interactions. The study also highlights the different types of actomyosins and their properties, as well as the role of ATP in muscle contraction and relaxation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
