The author examines the ionization in oxygen, nitrogen, helium, and hydrogen, and provides a formula that explains the temperature and pressure variations in ionization. The results indicate that the positive ionization is caused by the gas adsorbed by the metal, and the negative ionization is not directly caused by hydrogen but by a change it produces in the platinum surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
