He noted the day of the month according to the nautical account and used observations of the sun, moon, and stars to calculate latitude and longitude. The compass variation was found to be 11\u00b09' East. This data helped improve navigation and understanding of Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
