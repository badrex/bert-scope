They find that the coefficient remains consistent in well-conditioned muscles, even during moderate levels of fatigue. The author also discusses the breakdown of phosphagen and its connection to lactic acid metabolism in muscle tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
