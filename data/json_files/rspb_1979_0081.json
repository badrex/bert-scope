{"article_id": "rspb_1979_0081", "revised_title": "Evolutionary Arms Races: Dynamics and Implications", "semantic_tags": ["Evolutionary Biology", "Adaptation", "Natural Selection", "Arms Race Theory", "Coevolution"], "tldr": "This article discusses the concept of arms races in evolution, where adaptations in one lineage lead to counter-adaptations in another, resulting in a continuous escalation of mutual counter-adaptations. The authors classify arms races as interspecific or intraspecific and symmetric or asymmetric, and explore factors that may give one side an advantage in an arms race. They also consider how arms races can end and their implications for understanding evolutionary change.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
