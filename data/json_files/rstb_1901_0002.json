They describe the structure and function of the endosperm, cotyledons, hypocotyl, and root in germinating seeds and young plants. The study reveals the importance of connecting threads in the transport of nutrients and ferments between cells and tissues in the plant.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
