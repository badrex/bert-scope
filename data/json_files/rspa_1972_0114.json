The authors construct the dispersion spectra, including imaginary and complex branches, and study the effects of wall thickness and Poisson ratio on cut-off frequencies. The findings provide valuable insights into the modal characteristics and behavior of cylindrical shells, with implications for engineering and technology applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Acoustics and Vibration"}
