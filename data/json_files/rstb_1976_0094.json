The authors analyze the pros and cons of each model and propose that the 'cumulated strain'-model, which considers the entire virus structure as a single protein, could be the most plausible explanation for length determination in supramolecular structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Virology"}
