He found that the resistance of a body moving in a fluid varies as the square of its velocity and the area of the body's cross-section. Vince also discovered that the resistance of a body moving in a fluid is affected by the shape of the body's back part. His experiments provided valuable insights into fluid dynamics and the behavior of fluids in motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
