They show that this effect is particularly significant for elements with high atomic numbers and low Debye temperatures, and can lead to improved penetration at low temperatures. The theory is applied to various elements at different temperatures, providing insights into the conditions under which thermal diffuse scattering and electronic excitation processes might predominate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
