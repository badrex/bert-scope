They discuss the rotational and vibrational structures of the upper state, comparing it to other well-known band systems. The study provides evidence that these bands belong to the <s>1s</s> state, contributing to the understanding of atomic physics and spectroscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
