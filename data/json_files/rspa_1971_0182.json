They argue that the Townsend theory is not applicable in this region and propose a method using Monte Carlo computer techniques to calculate the number of ionizing collisions made by an electron moving from the cathode to the anode. The study demonstrates that the theory can explain why some gases exhibit a re-entrant form of the Paschen curve, while others do not.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
