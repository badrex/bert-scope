They study the spatial distribution of elements in alloys and the segregation of impurities and dopant elements in tungsten wire. This research helps understand the retention of volatile dopant elements during heat treatment of tungsten wire.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
