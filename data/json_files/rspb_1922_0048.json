They propose that the enzyme is a selective catalyst and classify enzymes into two categories: homo-lytic and hetero-lytic. The study reveals that the enzyme can influence or direct attack at two centers simultaneously in hypoxanthin, while affecting only one in xanthin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
