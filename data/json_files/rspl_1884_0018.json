They explain how the pseudosphere can be used to understand the properties of non-Euclidean spaces and how it relates to Euclid's twelfth axiom. The author also discusses the differences between the descriptive properties of the pseudosphere and the imaginary spherical surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
