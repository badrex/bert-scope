They discover that a protective coating on the surface of Nemeritis eggs and larvae prevents the insects' blood cells from reacting to the parasitoid. This coating is composed of minute particles that inhibit the adhesion of blood cells, providing resistance to the defence reactions of various hosts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
