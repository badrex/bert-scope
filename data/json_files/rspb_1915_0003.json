The authors found that certain salt concentrations can inhibit hemolysis, and this effect can be counteracted by increasing the concentration of the hemolytic antibody or complement. The results also showed that in hypotonic solutions, the amount of antibody needed to cause lysis may be decreased, and complement can combine with red cells without the intervention of hemolytic antibody in mixtures with little or no ionizable salt.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
