It finds that cell size contributes between one-third and two-thirds to evolutionary changes in organ and body size, challenging the textbook answer that larger organisms result from an increase in cell number and not cell size. The research also provides insights into the developmental programs that produce individuals and organs of different sizes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
