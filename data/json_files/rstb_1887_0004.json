They examined the air in various types of houses and schools, comparing the amounts of these impurities with death rates and disease frequencies. The study found that organic matter and micro-organisms in the air had a more significant impact on health than carbonic acid levels. The authors also discussed methods for measuring these impurities and the importance of proper ventilation in improving indoor air quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Air Pollution and Indoor Air Quality"}
