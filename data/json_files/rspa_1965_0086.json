The authors explore the relationship between applied stress and displacement at the crack tip, and introduce a model that includes work hardening during the relaxation process. The findings can be used to predict dangerous stresses for notched structures and identify dangerous notch sizes for structures subjected to a given stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
