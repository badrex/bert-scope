The patient's abdomen was inspected, revealing a mortified and rotting colon with excrement-filled chambers. The obstruction was found in the colon, which was doubled and had adherent surfaces. Upon separating the coalescence, a whitish mucus was released, and the colon was found to be sound and free of excrement beyond the obstruction. This case study highlights the importance of understanding and treating intestinal issues.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Gastroenterology"}
