They also determined the rate constants for silene insertion into Si-H bonds and estimated the activation energies involved in the reaction. The reaction was found to be homogeneous in its early stages, with no detectable dependence on surface-to-volume ratio.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
