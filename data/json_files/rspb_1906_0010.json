They found that the incitor element, also known as opsonin, enhances phagocytosis by preparing bacteria for engulfment by white blood cells. The authors also discussed the importance of eliminating sources of fallacy, such as spontaneous phagocytosis, to properly investigate the nature of the incitor element in heated serum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
