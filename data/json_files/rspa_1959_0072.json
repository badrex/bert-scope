They find that the methylene can have excess energy, which leads to different reactions. The results show that the excited methylene reacts with isobutene to form 1,1-dimethylcyclopropane, which can isomerize into other products. The study provides insights into the reactivity of methylene and the role of energy in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
