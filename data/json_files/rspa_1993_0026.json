The authors found that certain fuels, such as diethyl ether, hydrogen, and carbon disulfide, are more susceptible to this type of ignition than others. They propose a hazard assessment based on the concept of black body radiation interacting with a 'black' particle, which proves to be more hazardous than the worst case encountered in practice.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Combustion and Fire Safety"}
