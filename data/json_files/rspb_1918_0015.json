After carefully repeating Bastian's experiments and taking strict precautions to avoid contamination, the author found no evidence of living organisms in the samples. The observed organized bodies were likely due to the slow deposition of silica from the colloidal solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
