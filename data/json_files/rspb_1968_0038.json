The researchers found that ornithine lipid is a specific constituent of the cytoplasmic membrane and not the cell wall. They also discovered that about 20% of the ornithine lipid in pigmented cells is not associated with chromatophores. The study provides insights into the nature and biogenesis of chromatophores and may have taxonomic importance for other bacterial species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
