Researchers investigated whether this ability is affected by factors such as the mother's milk composition, the age of the mother, and the introduction of solid food. They found that the ability to absorb antibodies is not affected by these factors and is a sudden, age-dependent process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
