The authors conducted experiments to determine the kata factor, which allows the readings to be expressed as cooling powers in millecalories per square centimeter per second. They also tested the new constant by using it in the velocity of the wind with the kata against standard anemometers at Kew Observatory. The kata-thermometer is useful in investigating the ventilation of rooms and detecting air movements that are too small to affect other anemometers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
