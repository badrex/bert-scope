They injected highly tinged liquors into the guts of live animals and observed that the chyle remained white and uniform. The author also discovered various types of worms in the intestines of animals, describing their appearance, behavior, and possible functions. These observations provide insights into the digestive system and the role of worms in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
