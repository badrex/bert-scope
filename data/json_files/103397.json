He discusses his experiments with pruning, grafting, and the circulation of sap in these plants. He found that certain pruning techniques and grafting methods can affect the color and growth of the plants, and that the yellow and green striped Jessamine plant can change its color when grafted onto a different stock.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
