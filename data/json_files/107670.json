He and his team used a wire micrometer to measure the comet's right ascensions and declinations. They also measured the angular distance of the comet from Aldebaran, Sirius, and Canopus. The comet's appearance and behavior were documented, including its color, tail length, and orientation.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comet observation"}
