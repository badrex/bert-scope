These fibrils have a similar macroperiod length to rat-tail collagen and show a series of bands in a polarized manner. The discovery of these fibrils in insect material could help explain the scarcity or absence of collagen fibers previously considered characteristic of the insect class.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Histology"}
