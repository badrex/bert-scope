They focus on the effect of anisotropy, which is the dependence of track length on orientation. Using a realistic Poisson line-segment model, they obtain formulae for the density of line segments intersecting a plane and for the length distributions of confined tracks, semi-tracks, and projected semi-tracks in terms of the conditional distribution of length given orientation. These formulae help explain and quantify the anisotropic effect observed in experimental data from fission track annealing studies."}
