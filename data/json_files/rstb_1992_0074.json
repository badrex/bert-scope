The results show that low and medium spontaneous rate auditory nerve fibers maintain greater amplitude modulation in their responses at high sound levels than high spontaneous rate units. Most anteroventral cochlear nucleus units still show significant amplitude modulation in their responses at sound levels where amplitude modulation almost completely disappears in high spontaneous rate auditory nerve fibers. Possible mechanisms of enhanced amplitude modulation in anteroventral cochlear nucleus units, including convergence of inputs from different spontaneous rate groups of auditory nerve fibers and a postsynaptic threshold mechanism in the soma, are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
