The researchers found that the speed of the nervous impulse per unit length is the same for both tall and short individuals. However, the time taken for the impulse to travel from the center to the periphery is longer in taller individuals. This research also shows that the nodes of Ranvier have no influence on the rate of the nervous impulse.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
