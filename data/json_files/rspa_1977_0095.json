Type of Approximation", "semantic_tags": ["Fluid Dynamics", "Stability Theory", "Taylor Vortices", "W.K.B. Approximation", "Slowly Varying Flow"], "tldr": "The article investigates the stability of flow between concentric cylinders when the speed of rotation is varying slowly. The W.K.B. type of approximation is applied to show that if the speed of the inner cylinder is increasing slowly, the growth rate for an axisymmetric disturbance is reduced, leading to an increase of the Taylor number at which growth would first occur. The study also confirms Hall's results of slight destabilization in the inner cylinder velocity with a small sinusoidal modulation of low frequency.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
