The authors calculate the surface impedance under various tip angles and discuss the behavior of resonances in the free electron model and an arbitrary Fermi surface with mass spread. They also explore the phenomenon of field splashes and their impact on resonance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
