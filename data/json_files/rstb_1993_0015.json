The LCR is responsible for the expression of the human globin genes, and its mechanism is studied through natural mutations and experiments in transgenic mice. The article highlights the importance of stage-specific transcription factors and the LCR's ability to create stable interactions with the genes, leading to position-independent expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
