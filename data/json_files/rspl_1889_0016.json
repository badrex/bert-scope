They discovered that plants can only assimilate carbon from carbohydrates or closely related bodies, and not from aldehydes or their derivatives. The study also found that plants have lost the ability to use organic compounds as a carbon source due to their normal process of obtaining carbon from CO2.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
