He proposes a hypothesis that light consists of material particles with a power of mutual repulsion, which can explain the deflection and curvature of light rays. The author also supports this theory by the analogy of the laws of heat and light, both exhibiting phenomena of reflection, refraction, and polarization.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
