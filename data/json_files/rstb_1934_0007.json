The research covers aspects such as the size and function of the testes, spermatogenesis, and the role of accessory organs. The hedgehog's reproductive cycle is described in detail, providing a quantitative basis for further experimental work and understanding of the species' biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
