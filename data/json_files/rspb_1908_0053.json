They found that the intensity of the stimuli applied to the afferent nerves determines whether the muscle experiences relaxation or contraction. The results indicate that the antagonism between reflexes is reversible and can be graded in intensity, providing insight into the complex interactions between opposing neural signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
