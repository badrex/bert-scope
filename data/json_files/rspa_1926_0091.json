They discover that the broadening of these lines is due to interatomic fields, and that the failure of high members of the diffuse series to appear in the arc is because they are broadened to the point of becoming unrecognizable. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of spectral lines in various conditions and the role of interatomic fields in the broadening of spectral lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
