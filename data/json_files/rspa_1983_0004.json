A model problem involving plane Poiseuille flow in a channel with a spanwise periodic variation of the basic flow is studied. The results show that this variation has a positive effect on the growth of larger Tollmien-Schlichting wave disturbances. Equations for the amplitudes of these disturbances are derived, and the regions in the wavenumber plane where equilibrium solutions are possible are identified.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
