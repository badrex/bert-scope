They found that the strain field in and around the abrasion patches could be explained by a fracture mechanism, with surface cracking and residual compression in the diamond. This supports the idea that abrasion of diamond surfaces is primarily due to fracture processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties of Materials"}
