This method improves upon earlier solutions that were restricted to lighter loads. The study considers material combinations of steel-glass and steel-steel and provides solutions for film thickness and pressure distributions at high loads.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
