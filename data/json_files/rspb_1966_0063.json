The mutant strain is unable to form tricarboxylic acid cycle intermediates from pyruvate or phosphopyruvate. The study concludes that phosphopyruvate carboxylase is essential for the net formation of C4-acids through carboxylation of C3-precursors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
