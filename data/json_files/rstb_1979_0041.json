The author presents a technique using a clonal hydroid and describes its sensitivity to changes in water quality in Swansea Bay. The article also explores the integration of biological responses to water samples collected from the field, providing a means of measuring water quality in its entirety. Chemical techniques are being developed to identify contaminants responsible for detected effects, with preliminary experiments suggesting that divalent metals and volatile hydrocarbon constituents can be selectively removed from seawater.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
