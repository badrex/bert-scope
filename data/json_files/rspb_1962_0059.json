They also explore the immunological properties of insulins and the development of antibodies in patients treated with heterologous insulin. The author highlights the importance of understanding insulin structure and its relationship to biological activity and immunological behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
