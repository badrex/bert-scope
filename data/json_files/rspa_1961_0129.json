They found that the partial equivalent volumes of the two species are independent of composition at a given temperature, and the isotherms of equivalent volume as a function of equivalent composition were straight lines. This unusual mixing behavior is discussed in relation to possible structures for nitrate melts and other ionic melts and liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
