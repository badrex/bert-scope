They found that the animal membrane's strong attraction for water allowed water to pass through it, while alcohol and other water-soluble substances caused the phenomena of endosmose. This research provided insights into the properties of animal membranes and their role in osmosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Osmosis"}
