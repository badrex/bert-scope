The authors perform a two-centre exchange calculation within a basis constructed from appropriately antisymmetrized products of one-centre functions belonging to the terms. The exchange parameters refer to interactions between separate one-centre orbitals, resembling the angular overlap parameters used to describe one-centre perturbations. The study focuses on binuclear bridged 'octahedral' high-spin cobalt compounds, which offer a wide range of possibilities for chemical and structural variation while being relatively easy to synthesize and stable."}
