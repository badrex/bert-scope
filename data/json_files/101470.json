The method involves setting up a correspondence between two observers, one in England and one abroad, who will observe the Moon's position among stars and its apparent diameter using telescopes. The observations will be conducted at specific times and under certain conditions, such as during eclipses. Once the distance of the Moon is found, the distance of the Sun can be deduced.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
