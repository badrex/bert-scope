He observes that the roads are horizontal lines along the steep sides of mountains and are composed of alluvial deposits. Darwin also notes that the roads disappear where the rock is exposed or where the slope is gentle. He suggests that the formation of the roads is due to the accumulation of matter in the form of mounds and the removal or corrosion of solid rock. Darwin believes that the roads were formed when water stood at the level of the ancient beaches, creating deltas and terraces.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
