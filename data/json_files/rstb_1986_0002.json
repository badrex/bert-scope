It examines the behavior and regulation of two families of transposable elements, P and I factors, and explores the potential impact of natural selection on the organism, population, and elements themselves. The study highlights the polymorphic nature of these elements in the genomic positions and their role in causing mutations and chromosome rearrangements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
