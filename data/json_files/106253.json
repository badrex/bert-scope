He examines and compares the methods of another scientist, Mr. De Luc, and provides a detailed account of his observations, measurements, and the instruments used. Shuckburgh's findings contribute to the understanding of the precision and accuracy of barometric measurements in determining the height of mountains.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
