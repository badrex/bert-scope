They found that increased carbon dioxide levels inhibit seed germination, suggesting that carbon dioxide may act as an inhibitory factor in seed development. This research has implications for understanding plant growth and development in changing environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
