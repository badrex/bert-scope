They found great geographical differences in gene frequencies and observed that changes in gene frequency may indicate changes in the environment. The incidence of most morphs in Clithon is stable over great distances, while some morphs show irregular fluctuations influenced by local conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
