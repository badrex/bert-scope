It explains how double-strand DNA breaks trigger recombination and how the RecBCD enzyme plays a crucial role in this process. The enzyme unwinds and cuts DNA at specific sites called Chi, which helps control the recombination process and increases its efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
