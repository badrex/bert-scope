The research shows that longer chain soluble molecules can penetrate at lower bulk concentrations and disrupt cohesion more effectively than shorter chain molecules. The findings suggest that the decrease of free energy when simple molecules penetrate an insoluble monolayer is larger than when they are adsorbed at an air-water surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
