They discovered that over time, hydrogen begins to appear alongside oxygen, which can be prevented by coating the anode with a layer of black oxide of nickel. The authors also discuss the possible mechanisms behind this phenomenon and the presence of hydrogen peroxide in the liquid around the anode.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
