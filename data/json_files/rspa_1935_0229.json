They discovered that the structure of ice changes depending on the temperature of the condensing surface, with a close-packed hexagonal structure forming at higher temperatures and an amorphous character at lower temperatures. The study provides insights into the phase transitions of ice and its potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
