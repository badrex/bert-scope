They discovered that the rays from radium can cause the oxidation process, which requires the presence of oxygen and light. The authors also found that the radium rays are different from the active rays of light and that the most active rays are the beta rays, which are a stream of negative electrons. The results of these experiments have implications for understanding the physiological effects of radium rays and the potential role of pigmentation in protecting against their lethal effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radioactivity"}
