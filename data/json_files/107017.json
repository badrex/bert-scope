They discuss and analyze the various theories and systems proposed by other naturalists, such as Reaumur, Gmelin, and Gartner, and present their own observations and opinions on the topic. The author argues that the grains found in these plants are true seeds, and they provide reasons to refute the theories that consider them as gems or gemmae carpomorpha."}
