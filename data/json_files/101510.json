The authors measured the eclipse's duration and apparent diameters using a 25-foot telescope and a pendulum. They noted significant variations in parallax due to air refraction and the Moon's surrounding atmosphere. The authors suggested that precise astronomical calculations could be made by comparing the observed data with celestial tables, helping to determine the accuracy of the tables and the difference in meridians. The Rudolphin Tables were found to be the closest to the truth in this case.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
