The authors use a continuous wave CO laser to study the absorption as a function of incident intensity. They observe saturation in the absorption at intensities more than about 1, and find that the absorption near the band-gap shows a different form and starts at very low intensities. A non-saturating band-tail absorption is also resolved, leading to a discussion of possible mechanisms for the linear and non-saturating absorption near the band-gap energy."}
