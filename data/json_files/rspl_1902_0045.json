The researchers found that when mice were placed in a pure oxygen environment, the amount of carbon dioxide exhaled per minute and per kilogram of body weight decreased significantly compared to when they were in regular air. This suggests that an oxygen-rich environment may affect the body's metabolism and gas exchange processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
