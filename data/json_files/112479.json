Hofmann, discovered a new class of bodies isomorphic to hydrocyanic acid, specifically focusing on cyanide of phenyl. This compound is formed by reacting aniline with cyanide and has unique properties, such as a blue color and a strong odor. The author also discusses the reactions of cyanide of phenyl with other compounds, such as acids and silver cyanide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
