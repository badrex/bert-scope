The authors found that these compounds primarily affect motor centers, causing tremors, convulsions, and paralysis. Benzene and its derivatives, such as chlorobenzene, bromobenzene, and iodobenzene, have similar effects on frogs, with the halogen radicals not significantly altering the benzene's action. The addition of hydroxyl to the benzene nucleus intensifies the convulsant action, with oxybenzene (carbolic acid) and dioxybenzene causing convulsions in frogs, and trioxybenzene causing milder jerkings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Pharmacology"}
