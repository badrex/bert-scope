Their measurements provided evidence in favor of the core theory, which attributes the geomagnetic field to deep-seated phenomena within the Earth. The results help test different theories about the origin of the Earth's magnetic field and contribute to the understanding of the Earth's core.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
