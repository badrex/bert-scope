He encouraged precise observations to determine the comet's distance and magnitude, which could potentially help decide the question of Earth's motion. Auzout shared his calculations with other astronomers, including Christiaan Huygens, and requested that they compare their observations to verify or disprove his predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
