The two phonic types occur in sympatry over much of Britain, suggesting that the pipistrelle bat species may consist of at least two cryptic sibling species. The study provides insights into the evolution of bimodal echolocation in bats and discusses a model for sympatric speciation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology"}
