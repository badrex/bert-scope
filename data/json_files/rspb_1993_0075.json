The authors develop a mathematical model to compare different types of vaccine imperfections and their effects on the required vaccination coverage for eradication. They emphasize the importance of long-term follow-up studies to detect waning vaccine-induced protection and distinguish between various types of imperfections in clinical trials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
