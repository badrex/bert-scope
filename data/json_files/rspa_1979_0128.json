The research shows that increasing the scale or reducing the intensity of approach turbulence increases the magnitude of all terms in the energy balance equation. The core region of the flame is relatively unaffected by small-scale instability, while large-scale instability maintains a constant ratio of turbulence production to viscous dissipation. The dominant terms in the energy balance are convection and advection when the flame turbulence consists mainly of large-scale fluctuating motion. Increasing the laminar burning velocity restores stability and causes a transition to region 2, where production and viscous dissipation dominate over convection and advection terms, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
