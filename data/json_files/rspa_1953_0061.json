{"article_id": "rspa_1953_0061", "revised_title": "Growth Patterns and Slip in Silver Crystals", "semantic_tags": ["Crystallography", "Dislocations", "Crystal Growth", "Silver", "Surface Science"], "tldr": "The authors study the growth patterns and slip in silver crystals, locating dislocations by spiral growth patterns on the surfaces. They observe deformation by unit slip associated with the movement of dislocations and discuss the techniques used to prepare and examine the crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
