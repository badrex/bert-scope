They found that the cerci contain approximately 3400 hair and campaniform sensilla, which form functional connections with a group of ten giant interneurons in the terminal abdominal ganglion. These interneurons respond to sound, air puff stimulation, and substrate vibration, showing a marked directional sensitivity to sound. The study provides insights into the precision of synapse formation in crickets with experimentally manipulated cercal development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
