They discuss the advantages of using centrifugal force over gravity sedimentation and provide a detailed explanation of the theoretical background and practical considerations for the method. The authors also compare the use of centrifuges with other methods like gravity separation and mechanical analysis of soils.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
