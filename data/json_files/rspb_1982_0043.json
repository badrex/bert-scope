The research shows that daily injections of alloantiserum can prevent the progression of GVHD and reverse the altered neuronal histogenesis in affected animals. This discovery provides insights into the potential use of alloantiserum for treating brain growth retardation caused by GVHD in children.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
