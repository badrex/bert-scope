They found that the temperature of the rock increased with depth, and the rate of increment was higher than in other observations made in Europe. The author suggests that this difference might be due to the topographical conditions and geological structure of the earth's crust under the crest of a great mountain chain.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
