They found that the state decays less than 20% of the time through alpha decay, and the sensitivity of the experiment was limited by a continuum from the break-up of the 10B+3He system. This research helps to resolve the discrepancy between previous experiments on the alpha-width of the 15.1 MeV state in 12C.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
