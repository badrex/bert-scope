They argue that intramolecular forces, through their influence on the configurational character of the polymer chain, can play a significant role in the crystallization of polymers. The study provides insights into the behavior of polymer solutions and the factors affecting polymer crystallization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
