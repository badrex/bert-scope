C. Stevenson, investigates flexure and torsion in prisms with uni-axial and asymmetric cross-sections. They discuss the flexural center and provide a complete and exact solution for the Saint-Venant flexure problem for an asymmetric cross-section. The study also highlights the importance of considering the work of Professor W. J. Duncan and the contributions of Zwolinsky in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
