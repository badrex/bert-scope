The study focuses on liquid-layer flow at subcritical Froude numbers and flow over relatively short steep humps, providing computational and theoretical insights into the behavior of these complex interactions in boundary layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
