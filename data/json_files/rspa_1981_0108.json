They discovered a surface state with m = 1 d-orbital character and examined its dispersion throughout the surface Brillouin zone. The study also explored the applicability of the tight-binding approximation to the understanding of the electronic structure of metal surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
