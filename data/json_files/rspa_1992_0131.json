They propose new formulae for both phases, which are applicable regardless of the nature or form of the equations of motion. The real geometric phase is defined as a functional on the set of all cyclic paths, while the complex geometric phase is defined as a functional on the set of all pairs of cyclic paths. The authors show that these phases are in general completely independent of each other.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
