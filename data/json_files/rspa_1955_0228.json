They compared the computed total energy loss with experimental data and discussed the accuracy of the Born approximation for heavy particle collisions. This study helps improve our understanding of the energy loss mechanisms in atomic hydrogen and contributes to the development of better theoretical models for charged particle interactions with matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
