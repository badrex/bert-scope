They provide a self-contained treatment of the subject, recovering and extending previous results, and establishing a definite existence criterion for numerical studies. This approach can also be used to study Stoneley waves in bonded anisotropic half-spaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
