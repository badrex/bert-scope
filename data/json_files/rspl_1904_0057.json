They filled the porcelain tube with water and the surrounding vessel with the solution, then noted the rate at which the water level in a graduated tube moved while increasing pressure on the solution. This method allowed them to determine osmotic pressures in concentrated solutions more accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution chemistry"}
