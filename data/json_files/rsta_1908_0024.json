T. Bottomley and F. A. King to measure thermal radiation at extremely low temperatures using liquid air and liquid hydrogen. They used solid copper globes and an enclosure to study the radiation between bodies at different temperatures. The research aimed to determine the loss of energy from a heated body to cooler surroundings under various conditions, such as the dimensions of the cooling body, the nature of the surfaces, and the mean absolute temperature. The findings contribute to the understanding of heat transfer and radiation in cryogenics and low-temperature physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
