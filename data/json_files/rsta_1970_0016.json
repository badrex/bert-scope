The authors find that abnormal behavior occurs in a composition range between 10 and 40 mole% N-oxyphenazine, consistent with the presence of a miscibility gap. They analyze melting points, morphologies, refractive indices, unit-cell dimensions, packing densities, densities, and thermal expansion coefficients to construct a phase diagram and study the solubility of the two components in one another.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
