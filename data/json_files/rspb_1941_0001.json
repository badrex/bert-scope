The research focuses on the ovaries, where the size and weight of the Graafian follicle and corpus luteum change throughout the cycle. The findings provide insights into the reproductive processes in the mare, which can contribute to improving fertility rates and understanding the relationship between anatomical changes and physiological processes during the oestrous cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
