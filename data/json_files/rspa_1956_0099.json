The authors use experimental data and theoretical calculations to derive these values for alkali-metal azides, providing a comprehensive understanding of their stability and reactivity. The findings contribute to the interpretation of the behavior of azides and help in calculating activation energies of decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermochemistry"}
