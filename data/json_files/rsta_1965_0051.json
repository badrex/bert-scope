They provide specific volumes, densities, and thermal expansivities in tabular form and discuss the thermal expansion of water relative to mercury. The study aims to improve the accuracy of pressure measurements and address the limitations of previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
