They use an example of a non-relativistic free particle to illustrate how a random model can give the correct main features for the range of physical conditions accessible to us today. The author believes that the fundamental laws of nature are random and so complicated that we could not attempt to guess them.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
