The author compares the magnetic periods with the sunspot periods and finds that they vary in a similar manner. The study provides insights into the connection between solar and terrestrial phenomena and the possible influence of sunspots on Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
