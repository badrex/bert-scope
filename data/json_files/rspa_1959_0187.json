The authors apply Brueckner theory to finite nuclei, considering six different internucleon potentials with varying hard core radii. They analyze the effects of energy level self-consistency and pair correlations on the potential energy and discuss the importance of the hard core radius in determining nuclear saturation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
