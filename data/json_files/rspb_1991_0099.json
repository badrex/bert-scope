They found that striolar hair cells in the utricle and lagena were sensitive to gentamicin, while extra-striolar hair cells were not. This discovery, combined with previous findings on ultrastructure and immunoreactivity, suggests that classifying fish ear hair cells as only \"vestibular type II\" may not be sufficient for understanding their structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
