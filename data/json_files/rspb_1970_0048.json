It explains that individual disks are determined for specific body parts of the adult organism, and that single cells can be determined for structures of a specific body region. The article also explores transdetermination, where cells change their determined state, and how it is related to homoiotic mutations and phenocopies in Drosophila.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
