They examined various structures, including the mesencephalic nucleus, inferior olive, and eighth nerve, and compared their findings with those of other mammals, such as Didelphys virginiana. The study aimed to understand the development and evolution of the mammalian brain, particularly in lower centers and the fore-brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
