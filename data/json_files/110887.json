The author identifies four main forms of corpuscles and their stages of development, including granule cells, nucleolated cells, and free vesicular nucleus cells. The study reveals similarities in the development of blood corpuscles across different animal classes, with slight differences in the final, colored stage of nucleolated cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
