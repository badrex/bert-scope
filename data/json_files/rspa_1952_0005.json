They find that the Heitler-London-Slater-Pauling method fails to give accurate transition rules for excited levels in conjugated systems due to the use of the Huckel approximation. The authors provide a detailed treatment of ethylene as a twelve-electron problem, considering six canonical structures and computing necessary exchange integrals. They explain the positions of absorption peaks and identify the bands in the spectrum, without needing to resort to hyperconjugation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
