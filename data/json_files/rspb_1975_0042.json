It examines the high concentration of nickel and cobalt in various plant species, including Hybanthus caledonicus and Psychotria douarrei. The research explores the different forms of nickel in these plants and their relationship with their substrates, providing insights into plant physiology and potential applications for colonizing ultrabasic substrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Plant Chemistry"}
