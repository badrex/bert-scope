They obtained all three vibrational frequencies and first-order anharmonic constants for the upper state and determined the rotational constants for some levels in the lower state. The study also revealed a Fermi resonance and the influence of the Renner effect on the vibrational structure of the lower state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
