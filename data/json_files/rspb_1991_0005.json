The results show that both age and past experience of the domestic chick affect the neurophysiological properties of brain slices tested in vitro. The probability of producing persistent potentiation of responses is higher in slices from chicks aged 2-5 days, indicating a relation between age and plasticity in the brain, which is modified by early visual experience.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
