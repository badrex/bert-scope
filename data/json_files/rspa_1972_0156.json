They approximate the integral equations for kinetic energy and shear stress, finding that the spatial average of the kinetic energy spectrum follows the Kolmogoroff distribution. This leads to a simple solution for the mean velocity profile, which compares well with experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
