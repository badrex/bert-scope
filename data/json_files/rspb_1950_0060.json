It explores various problems involving limited growth and seasonal growth, and highlights the significance of accurate growth studies in fossils for critical work. The author also presents examples of how growth studies can help in taxonomic and stratigraphical studies, and how they contribute to our understanding of the evolution of major groups of vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
