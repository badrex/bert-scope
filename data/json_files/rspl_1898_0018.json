They found that non-conducting solid films on metal surfaces can eliminate metal-air potentials, and that liquid films can cause significant changes in potential. The study also shows that exposure to the atmosphere does not usually produce rapid changes in Volta potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
