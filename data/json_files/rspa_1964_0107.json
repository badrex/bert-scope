The researchers found that the mercury anode reaches the 'calomel potential' quickly, and the film thickness becomes steady after some time. The experimental results support a dissolution-precipitation model involving a Hg/KCl interface charged to the 'calomel potential' through the formation of mercurous ions and specifically adsorbed chloride ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
