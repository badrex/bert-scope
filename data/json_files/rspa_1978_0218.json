The study uses direct numerical evaluation of the dynamical theory to demonstrate the zero-level-of-interaction limit for both finite and infinite-thickness perfect crystals. The findings reveal that integrated reflectivity can exceed that of the corresponding semi-infinite crystal and can even surpass that of an ideally mosaic crystal in certain cases, leading to the phenomenon of negative extinction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
