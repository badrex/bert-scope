The author, Richard Bradley, explains the role of the root in receiving nutrients from the earth and how these nutrients are distributed throughout the plant. He also describes the structure of a tree branch and the process of sap movement, using a microscope to observe the vessels in the wood and the different layers of bark. The author suggests that each layer of bark may have different properties and may contain separate juices with different virtues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
