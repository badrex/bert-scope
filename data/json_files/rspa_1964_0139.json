They introduce a pair of auxiliary functions that satisfy a pair of coupled first-order differential equations, which are used to calculate interband tunnelling probability. This method extends the effective-mass approximation for the case of varying energy in allowed bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
