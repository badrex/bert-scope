They studied the contrast of Frank loops in copper and stacking-fault tetrahedra in a Cu 10 at.% Al alloy under various diffraction conditions. The results provide useful information for identifying the nature and geometry of defects in materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
