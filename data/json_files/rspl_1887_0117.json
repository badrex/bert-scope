They propose two types of iliac bones for classification purposes and analyze the differences in pelvic construction and pneumatic condition of vertebrae among various dinosaur groups. The author suggests that these differences can help distinguish between dinosaur orders and sub-orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
