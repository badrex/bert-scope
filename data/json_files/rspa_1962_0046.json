It explores the circumstances under which orthogonal relations exist between the elastic critical modes of plane frames and introduces a general expression that reveals the relation between deformations at an arbitrary load level and the deflections given by linear analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Analysis"}
