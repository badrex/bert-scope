They found that the burning rate significantly decreases when gunpowder is mixed with stearic acid or other fatty acids. The inhibition effect is dependent on the type of carbon used in the gunpowder composition. The researchers suggest that the inhibitors create a mechanical barrier on the surface of the charcoal, interfering with the initial reactions between the charcoal and nitrate, which determines the flame propagation rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
