The meteor moved from north to south with great velocity and had a bright silver-colored nucleus and a tail resembling the color of a burning coal. The author, Henry Baker, submitted this observation to the Royal Society, hoping it would be considered an extraordinary phenomenon of the year 1750. The hot weather in the preceding part of the month of July might have contributed to the generation of this meteor.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
