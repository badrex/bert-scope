They observed variations in the number of micro-organisms present in the air based on the season and location. The results showed an enormous increase in the number of micro-organisms in crowded rooms. The authors also estimated the number of organisms falling on a given horizontal surface using nutrient gelatine dishes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
