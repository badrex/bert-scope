The authors explore the concept of the orientated monolayer and confirm its existence through optical and electrical methods. They also examine various film states, such as solid, liquid condensed, liquid expanded, and gaseous, and their transitions. Additionally, the article highlights the potential for controlling reaction rates by manipulating molecular orientation in films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
