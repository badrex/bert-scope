They analyze the motion of a fluid near a sheet with waves of lateral displacement and find that the sheet moves forward at a rate times the velocity of the wave propagation. This analysis explains how a propulsive tail can move a body through a viscous fluid without relying on reaction due to inertia. The energy dissipation and stress in the tail are also calculated.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
