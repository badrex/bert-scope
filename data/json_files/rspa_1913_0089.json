The authors found that ionisation from incandescent carbon is largely affected by chemical reactions and impurities, which led to doubts about the electronic emission theory. They conducted experiments with highly purified gases and observed that ionisation is related to the chemical action or some intermediate effect exerted by the gas in contact with the solid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
