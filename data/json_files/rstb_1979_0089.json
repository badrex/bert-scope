The study found that concentrations of trace elements vary between sites but have more uniform relative concentrations, suggesting a similarity of origin or good atmospheric mixing. The research also classified trace elements as either soil-derived or industrial, and examined the relationship between particle size and enrichment factors. The findings have implications for understanding the health impacts of atmospheric pollution and the potential sources of trace elements in the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Geochemistry"}
