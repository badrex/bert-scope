The research shows that bacteria growth is inhibited in the presence of carbon dioxide, with the inhibition being more pronounced at lower temperatures. The findings are significant for understanding the deterioration of fresh fish and the preservation of fish during transportation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
