They describe mutations that affect the symmetry and discuss the evolution of irregular flowers. The study of genes controlling floral symmetry can help understand the molecular mechanisms underlying floral evolution and the role of genes like \"cyc\" in establishing asymmetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
