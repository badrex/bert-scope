The authors use an enlarged geophysical data set to confirm that the spreading episode started around 8 million years ago, with asymmetric spreading and an increase in the total rate about 1.5 million years ago. They also discuss the transformation of an earlier regime involving coupled subduction and back-arc extension into the present, self-contained Sandwich plate regime. The authors propose a speculative model to explain this transformation and consider the implications for the entire Scotia Sea's formation."}
