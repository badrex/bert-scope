They show that this function is symmetric for an n-body Schrodinger operator restricted to a subspace of prescribed symmetry and demonstrate how it can be used to obtain criteria for the finiteness and infiniteness of bound states of polyatomic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
