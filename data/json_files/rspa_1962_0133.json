They investigated the adsorption energies of bismuth atoms to the surfaces using the beta recoil method. The results showed that the chemical nature of the surface determines the recoil yield, and the magnitude of the yield is comparable to the expected binding energy of the daughter atom on the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
