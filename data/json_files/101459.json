Drinking one stream's water causes death within days, while the other stream's water kills worms in the belly without harming the person. Mixing the two streams creates a third water with similar properties to the spring. This discovery could potentially lead to natural remedies for health issues.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Toxicology"}
