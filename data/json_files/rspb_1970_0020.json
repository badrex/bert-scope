The researchers found that the orientation of the central fibrils influences the direction of the effective stroke, but they cannot rule out the possibility that the direction of bending causes a passive twist of the central pair during the recovery stroke. The study uses a combination of techniques, including potassium chloride solutions, instantaneous fixation, and scanning electron microscopy, to analyze the cilia's structure and movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology"}
