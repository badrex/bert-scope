The researchers found that the surface potential in condensed films of nitriles was constant, and the dielectric constant of these films was about 7, which is lower than that of water. The transition between condensed and expanded films is heterogeneous, and the effective dielectric constant of the surroundings of the film molecules is estimated to be around 7.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
