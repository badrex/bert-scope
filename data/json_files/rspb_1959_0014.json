They found that pyruvate was partially oxidized in the tricarboxylic acid cycle and gave rise to alanine and other amino acids. No pyruvate was converted back to sugars or other carbohydrates in either tissue. This study provides insights into the metabolic pathways and substrate replacement in plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
