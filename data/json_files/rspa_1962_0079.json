They discover that under specific static conditions, the Weyl-Majumdar condition follows from the Dirac equations alone, and the whole set of field equations reduces to one nonlinear equation. This class of static solutions is the only possible one that can be constructed from coupled Maxwell-Einstein-Dirac field equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
