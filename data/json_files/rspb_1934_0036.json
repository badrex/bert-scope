They found that the heat production is due to a propagated disturbance and not a direct effect of the stimulus. The author also established a connection between nerve heat production and muscle contraction by comparing the strength-duration curve for both responses, suggesting that heat production is directly associated with the process of impulse transmission causing muscle contraction."}
