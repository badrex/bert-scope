The design corrects errors caused by the spherical figure of the lenses and the different refrangibility of light. This improvement allows for better precision in measurements and a larger angle of vision. The new eye-glass system can also be easily adjusted for different magnifying powers and is suitable for various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics"}
