Previous experiments had varying results due to the presence of combined acids or bases. The author found that when using iso-electric hemoglobin, the osmotic pressure was lower, and higher pressures were obtained when conductivity and hydrogen-ion determinations showed the presence of acid or base. The molecular weight of pure hemoglobin is about four times the equivalent.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
