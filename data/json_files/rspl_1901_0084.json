The authors use a method of harmonic analysis to study the temperature data from various stations and find that the second-order effect, with maxima in February and August and minima in May and November, is mainly due to meteorological factors rather than the cyclonic or anticyclonic type of weather.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
