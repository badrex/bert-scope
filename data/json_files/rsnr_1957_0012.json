It highlights his development of the neurone theory, his work on synapses, and his pioneering research on reflexes and the central nervous system. Sherrington's concepts, such as the principle of convergence, the final common path, and reciprocal innervation, have had a lasting impact on the understanding of the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Neuroscience"}
