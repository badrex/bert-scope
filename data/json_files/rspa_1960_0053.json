It explores various intermolecular interactions, such as dipole-dipole, London dispersion, and quadrupole effects, and their influence on electronic, vibrational, rotational, and nuclear spin energy levels. The study also highlights a new form of transition observed in low-frequency measurements, which is attributed to translational motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
