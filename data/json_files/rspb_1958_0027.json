They explore different techniques to create heritable cytoplasmic variation and observe a consistent difference in sub-line 0, suggesting a cytoplasmic constitution that increases bristle number. The author also attempts to select for cytoplasmic differences in a wild stock, observing a possible initial cytoplasmic difference and a response to selection reducing this difference.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
