They find that fast electrons are unaffected by thin gas layers on surfaces, allowing for the study of solid layers. The technique is demonstrated on various materials, including gold, platinum, and asbestos, with promising results for the study of surface chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
