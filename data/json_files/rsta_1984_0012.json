The authors analyze the geochemical and isotopic evidence to determine the relative contributions of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental crust to magma genesis. They find that the enriched spinel herzolite mantle, containing at least a component of 2.5 Ga material, is the primary source for the tholeiitic melts. The authors also evaluate the role of crustal contamination and fractional crystallization in the evolution of these magmas.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
