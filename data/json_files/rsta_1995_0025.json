They use the center and invariant manifold theories to establish the proper time and length scale separations for effective transport equations and determine the dependence of effective transport coefficients on the kinetics of adsorption/desorption and reaction. The study also examines the spatial evolution of time-dependent inlet conditions and the impact of nonlinear interactions among reaction, diffusion, and convection.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
