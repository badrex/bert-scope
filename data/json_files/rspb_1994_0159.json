The results show that implanted males became more aggressive, expanding their territories at the expense of unimplanted neighbors. This led to a decrease in population density, as some unimplanted males left the study area. Implanted males also had better breeding success, but poorer subsequent survival compared to control males. This research demonstrates the role of individual behavior in influencing bird population dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
