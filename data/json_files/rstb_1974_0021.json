The authors classify the algae into five classes based on their cell wall's two-dimensional repeating unit cell. They provide detailed structural information for two classes and discuss the role of hydroxy-proline residues in the wall glycoprotein. The article also describes the conditions necessary for in vitro reassembly of the cell wall and the implications of the crystalline cell walls for taxonomy and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
