The researchers confirm sensitization using dropweight impact experiments and develop a new method using differential scanning calorimetry to measure the effect. They find that the nitrocompound-amine mixtures decompose at lower temperatures than the pure components and require a lower impact energy to initiate ignition. The study explains the sensitization by the formation of charge transfer complexes between amines and nitrocompounds, which weaken the nitrocompound C-N bond involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Energetic Materials"}
