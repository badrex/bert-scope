They discovered that injecting trypan blue or thorotrast into the tumours made them more sensitive to X-rays, leading to better results in treating the tumours. Other substances, like vital new red and isamine blue, did not have the same effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Oncology"}
