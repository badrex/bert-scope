The study finds that if certain conditions are met, a wave is totally stable. The center manifold theorem is used to analyze the nature of solutions that bifurcate from a marginally unstable plane wave, leading to Hopf bifurcations and the formation of limit cycles or tori.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
