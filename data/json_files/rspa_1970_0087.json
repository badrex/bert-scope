The authors develop a theoretical analysis for a power law fluid in impact conditions and compare it with experimental results, providing insights into the rheology of these fluids and their potential applications in elastohydrodynamic lubrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
