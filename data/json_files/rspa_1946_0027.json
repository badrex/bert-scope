They focus on the interaction between dipoles and the behavior of these solids at different temperatures. The static dielectric constant increases with temperature up to a critical point, after which it decreases. The authors also predict the existence of metastable states with permanent polarization and discuss methods to reach these states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
