They found that the pupae's color is influenced by the environment, with some species having varieties suitable for different surroundings. The study also shows that the larvae are sensitive to color during a specific period before pupation, and the color influence acts on them during that time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
