This instrument can be used with a circle or a zenith telescope, making it more versatile and accurate for astronomical observations. The vertical floating collimator offers a faster and more precise method for determining the zenith point, potentially replacing the use of levels and plumb lines in celestial observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Instrumentation"}
