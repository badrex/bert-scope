The research reveals high levels of long-chain co3 polyunsaturated fatty acids in glyceride-esters, the presence of large amounts of triglyceride in certain species, and a simple sterol composition dominated by cholesterol. These findings contribute to understanding the lipid chemistry of freshwater organisms and the evolution of the unique Baikalian fauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Freshwater Biology"}
