He also discovered that the point of maximum motion in a glacier moves from side to side depending on the curvature of the valley. Additionally, Tyndall studied the bands of white ice on the Glacier du Geant and explained their formation and the physical properties of ice, such as its fragility and regelation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
