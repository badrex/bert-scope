This enzyme is responsible for transforming the initial linear (1-3)-glucan into the branched (1-3)-(1-6)-glucan found in the cell wall of C. albicans. This finding sheds light on the mechanisms of cell wall formation and modification in yeasts and fungi.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Yeast Biology"}
