They explain that the efficiency of intramolecular reactions is due to differences in entropy and strain energy. Enzymes do not solely rely on chemical mechanisms for rate enhancement; the forces of interaction between non-reacting parts of the substrate and enzyme also contribute to lowering the activation energy of the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
