Researchers used a 35 high-temperature vessel to inject water at various pressures and temperatures, allowing them to study the behavior of water under extreme conditions. The findings contribute to the understanding of water's properties and its role in various scientific and industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
