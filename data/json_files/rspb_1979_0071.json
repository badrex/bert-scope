This material, which may be identical to the optic gland hormone, is not membrane-bound and has a size of about 30 nm. The hormone is involved in a defense mechanism against non-octopus proteins and may cause death in cephalopods to limit population growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Endocrinology"}
