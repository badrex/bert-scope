They used a sensitive physical balance with a 20-inch beam, supporting two coils with a vertical axis, and fixed coils carried from the base. The balance was able to measure the electromagnetic forces and provide an accurate determination of the forces between the coils, which was a significant improvement in measuring current at the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
