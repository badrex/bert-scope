The author conducts experiments to visualize and analyze the motion, discovering that the complete residual motion of the water is dependent on the depth of the water compared to the length of the stationary wave. The study also reveals that the \"end vortices\" appear at each node of any series of stationary waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
