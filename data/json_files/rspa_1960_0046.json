They examine how the vibration frequencies of molecules change when dissolved in solvents containing halogen atoms, and explore the relationship between the solvent's electron density and the vibration frequencies. The study also investigates the variation of band intensity and the significance of dielectric effects on molecular interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
