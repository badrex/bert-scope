They used two methods, the 'ancestral sequence' and the 'flexible numerical matrix' methods, to create the tree. The results showed that the tree based on cytochrome c sequences agreed with existing phylogenies based on morphological characters. This study highlights the potential of molecular data in understanding plant phylogenies, even in the absence of a complete fossil record.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
