It emphasizes the importance of using simple ratios and hands-on knowledge of the groups in question to extrapolate patterns and make reliable estimates. The article also highlights the need for appropriate rigor in assembling species datasets, including accurate species recognition and sorting. The focus is on terrestrial free-living metazoans, with examples drawn largely from work on Coleoptera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Biodiversity"}
