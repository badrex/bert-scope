The authors present results from seismic investigations and deep drilling, providing insights into the structure and geology of the region. They describe features such as the smooth acoustic basement, the Cretaceous carbonate front, and the existence of a 7.1 km/s layer at a depth of 14 km.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
