The gas vesicle suspension was contained in a glass tube, and the elastic compressibility was determined by applying or removing pressure and measuring the displacement of the meniscus in the capillary. The results confirmed that gas vesicles are rigid structures and showed that buoyancy will be relatively unaffected by pressures that do not cause gas vesicle collapse. The apparatus can also be used to measure the volume of gas vesicle gas space and investigate the gas vesicle critical collapse pressure."}
