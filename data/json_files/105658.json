The sea's sudden and violent movements surrounded a plough and its driver, while a church and tower were damaged by lightning. These events were also felt in other nearby harbors. The author, William Borlase, provides detailed accounts of these incidents and their effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
