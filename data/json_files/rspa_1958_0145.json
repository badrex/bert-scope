They successfully attached heavy atoms to specific sites on the myoglobin molecule in type A crystals, allowing them to determine the signs of the protein reflexions and create a two-dimensional Fourier synthesis. This research serves as a first step towards a three-dimensional synthesis that will reveal the general layout of the myoglobin molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}
