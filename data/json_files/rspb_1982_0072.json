The researchers found that endplate channel open time and conductance increased nonlinearly with decreasing sodium concentration. The results support the hypothesis that binding sites for sodium ions can modulate both channel lifetime and conductance, becoming saturated at higher sodium concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
