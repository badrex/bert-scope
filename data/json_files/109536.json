He found that the powder could be prepared more effectively using a humid method instead of intense heat. Chenevix also observed that the powder's effects were similar to other antimony-based medicines, making it a more mild and effective option for patients.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pharmacology"}
