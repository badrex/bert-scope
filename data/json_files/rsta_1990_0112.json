They obtained quantum state distributions, vector correlations, and vibrational and rotational fragment pair correlations using polarized, Doppler-resolved laser-induced fluorescence techniques. The results provide insights into the energy redistribution within the molecules and highlight the role of rotation in promoting rotation-vibration coupling."}
