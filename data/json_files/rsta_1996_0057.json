The authors test the Birch-Murnaghan equation, which is widely used to describe the behavior of minerals under compression, by comparing it with experimental data. They find that the equation works well for simple structures but may not accurately describe more complex structures, highlighting the need for further research and development of more accurate equations of state.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
