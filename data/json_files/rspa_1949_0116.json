They found that the polymerization process involves four types of reactions: initiation, propagation, transfer, and termination. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanisms and helps improve the understanding of vinyl polymerizations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
