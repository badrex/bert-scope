They discovered that active nitrogen can transfer a large amount of energy to the metals, causing them to glow red hot or even melt. This phenomenon helps measure the energy of active nitrogen, which is difficult to reconcile with existing theories. The energy collected from the gas is surprisingly large and can only be partially explained by dissociation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas Physics"}
