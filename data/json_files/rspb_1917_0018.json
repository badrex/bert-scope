They found that the most effective germicidal action occurs in the range of 2960 to 2380 Angstrom units. The study also showed a strong correlation between the region of germicidal action and the absorption spectrum of the bacteria. This research has implications for understanding the effectiveness of ultra-violet radiation in killing bacteria and preventing infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
