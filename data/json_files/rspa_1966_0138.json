They found that these liquids' viscosities cannot be described by an Arrhenius-type equation but can be represented by a modified Doolittle volume equation. The authors discovered that the onset of aggregation of molecules in the supercooled state affects the viscosity behavior of these liquids. This effect is more apparent as the length of the side group attached to the benzene ring is reduced.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
