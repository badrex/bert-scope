This element, called \"Resistance of Flexure,\" is due to the lateral action of fibers or particles on each other. The experiments showed that the neutral axis is in the center of the beam, and the outer portions of the beam do not extend proportionally to the applied force due to this lateral action.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
