They discovered a permanent diminution in the volume of nitrogen, which they attributed to the formation of an allotropic modification of nitrogen. The experiments involved a detailed process of gas purification and the use of various electrodes and pressures to study the effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
