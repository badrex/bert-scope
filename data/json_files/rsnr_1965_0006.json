Maskelyne's observations on night myopia, which is an increase in the eye's refractive power under low light conditions, were made over a century before Lord Rayleigh's independent discovery. The author also highlights Maskelyne's attempt to explain the phenomenon's relationship with the eye's chromatic aberration, which is a contributing factor in the production of night myopia. This discovery has implications for astronomical observations and telescope design.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
