The author introduces new variables and a transformation to simplify the equations and separate trivial conserved quantities from non-trivial ones. The study focuses on the quadratic case and demonstrates that a reduced form of the equations exists, which implies the existence of a quadratic first integral. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of spinning test particles in the context of general relativity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
