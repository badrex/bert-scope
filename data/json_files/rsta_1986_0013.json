Improved water management has led to stabilized crop habitats and reduced the impact of seasonality, which has profound implications for pest population dynamics and disease epidemiology. The author provides examples of how irrigation has affected pest problems, particularly in rice cultivation, and suggests ways to minimize the negative effects of irrigation on pest management.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Soil Management"}
