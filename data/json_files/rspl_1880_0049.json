Norman Lockyer, observed iron lines in solar spots and confirmed that these lines were contorted in fine spots visible on specific dates. These observations support the view that the constituents of our terrestrial elements exist in independent forms in the sun. The findings are crucial for understanding the nature of solar spots and their relationship to the sun's elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
