It was kept alive in a closed container with no access to sustenance. The beetle's ability to survive without food has led to speculation that it may obtain nourishment from particles in the air, similar to how some plants grow. This discovery has implications for understanding the variety of ways animals can obtain nutrients and survive in different environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
