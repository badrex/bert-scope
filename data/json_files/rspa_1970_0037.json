The model is applied to the shock problem, and the shock equations are evaluated numerically for argon. The results show that for high Mach numbers, the total enthalpy within the shock no longer remains constant, and the model predicts a deviation from the Navier-Stokes solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
