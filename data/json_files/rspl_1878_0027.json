They discovered that ozone or oxidized conditions play a significant role in the nuclear action of oils, which can cause the sudden solidification of these solutions. The author found that essential oils, such as oil of cajuput, and phosphorus can be used to trigger this nuclear action. This research helps to explain the contradictory results obtained by other observers and provides a better understanding of the factors influencing these reactions."}
