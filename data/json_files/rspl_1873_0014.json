It covers the work of Jacobi, Sohnke, Joubert, and Konigsberger, and explores the cases of n=7 and n=11 in detail. The author presents a clearer understanding of the algebraic question and still finds it necessary to resort to the transcendental theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
