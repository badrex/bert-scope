This law accounts for changes in aerodynamic resistance and allows for numerical integration of the equations of motion. Universal range tables are provided, which can estimate dispersal distances for various practical cases. This study is useful for botanists and ecologists studying seed and particle dispersal in the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Fluid Dynamics"}
