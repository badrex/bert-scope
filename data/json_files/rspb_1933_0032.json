This phenomenon occurs in 74 species from 17 different families. The anatomy of these woods is discussed in relation to the occurrence of this type of cell, and it is suggested that the factor of importance in determining the frequency of perforated ray cells is the relative proportions of the marginal ray cells and the vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
