The authors propose that tidal flow, seasonal variations in heating, and wind stirring are the main factors controlling plankton in the southern North Sea. They use a numerical model to test their hypothesis and compare it with observations of seasonal cycles and spatial variations in phyto- and zoo-plankton. The study highlights the importance of tidal mixing fronts, residual circulation, and nutrient-rich river discharges on microplankton community production and its fate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
