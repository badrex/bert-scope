The authors analyze the data to determine whether the variability is a local or a world-wide phenomenon and discuss the possible physical causes of the daily magnetic variation. They also explore the system of overhead electric currents that could produce the quiet-day solar diurnal magnetic variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
