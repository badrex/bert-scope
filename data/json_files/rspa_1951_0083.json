The author presents a model for a barrier with a varying volume density of impurity centers and demonstrates how this model can be applied to a wide range of barrier layers. The study provides a deeper understanding of rectifying junctions and contributes to the development of more efficient rectifiers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
