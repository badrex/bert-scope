The distribution of label in isoleucine indicates that the 2-ketobutyrate required for isoleucine biosynthesis is mainly produced through the pyruvate elongation pathway. A small proportion of isoleucine is also produced via an alternative route involving propionyl and 2-ketobutyrate synthase. Threonine and glutamate are not used as sources of 2-ketobutyrate production for isoleucine biosynthesis under these growth conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
