They found that the potential is influenced by various electrolytes and is a logarithmic function of the activity of the electrolyte solution. The results provide insights into the electrokinetic properties of barium sulfate and its potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
