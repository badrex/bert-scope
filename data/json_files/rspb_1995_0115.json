Researchers found that females can specifically recognize and preferentially brood their own eggs over those of another conspecific. A significant correlation was discovered between the time spent brooding and genetic similarity determined by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. This is the first demonstration of a quantitative relation between genetic relatedness and maternal care in amphibians, with implications for the nature of maternal kin recognition and its effect on kin-selective behavior in this class.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
