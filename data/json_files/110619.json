F. Talbot, discovered a new method for creating images without the need for an artist. By using light-sensitive paper, natural objects could be captured in detail. This process, called photogenic drawing, allowed for quick image capture and a variety of effects depending on the paper's preparation. Talbot shared this innovative method with the scientific community, hoping it would be embraced by those interested in science and nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Light sensitivity"}
