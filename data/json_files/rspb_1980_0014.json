It reveals a complex network of tracheae and tracheoles throughout the neuropile regions, providing oxygen to the locust's brain and ganglia. The tracheal system plays a crucial role in supplying oxygen to the locust's central nervous system, while the blood plays a minimal part in respiration due to the presence of a blood-brain interface.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
