The approximation is based on a hexagonal and square boundary for progressive and standing waves, respectively. This method agrees with previous numerical calculations and experimental observations, providing a useful tool for understanding and calculating the force of high waves against structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
