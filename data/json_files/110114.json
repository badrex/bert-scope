She found that steel exposed to the violet rays of the solar spectrum became magnetic. The experiments were successful with various sizes and positions of needles, and the magnetism was strongest in the violet, indigo, and blue rays. The author concludes that a magnetic influence in the more refrangible solar rays is demonstrated.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
