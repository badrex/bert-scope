Caffeine does not affect the initial spike but suppresses the subsequent oscillations. This discovery provides insights into the two-pool model for generating calcium oscillations and the role of caffeine in calcium signaling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
