They re-analyze previous data and show that inseminations made just before or after egg-laying have a lower overall chance of fertilization. This is due to the reduced sperm retention by females during these times. The study highlights the importance of understanding the factors that determine the outcome of sperm competition in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
