They discovered two reactions, the \"lengthening reaction\" and the \"shortening reaction,\" which are reflexes initiated by stretching or shortening the muscle. These reactions contribute to the plasticity of muscle tone, allowing for better control and coordination of opposing muscle movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
