The results show that anions with a diameter of about 4 \u00c5 have the highest permeability, while larger anions have lower permeabilities. The permeability sequence for both channels is SCN\u207b > NO\u2083\u207b > I\u207b > Br\u207b > Cl\u207b > Formate\u207b > Acetate\u207b > Bicarbonate\u207b > Gluconate\u207b > F\u207b > Phosphate\u207b. The study also reveals that the concentration dependence and mole-fraction dependence of permeation are similar for both GABA- and glycine-gated channels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience", "sub_discipline": "Neurotransmitters and Receptors"}
