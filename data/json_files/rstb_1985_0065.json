They found that both \u03bc and K opioid receptors can independently cause analgesia, and that the side effects of morphine, such as inhibition of gut motility and respiratory depression, are also \u03bc-mediated. \u03b2-FNA is a powerful tool for analyzing the \u03bc component of analgesic drugs in clinical use.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
