The presence of helpers reduces the dominant male's workload during the nestling period, allowing them to increase the rate of extra-territorial forays to court nearby females. DNA fingerprinting reveals that males in groups are more likely to obtain extra-group fertilizations, which may compensate for lost paternity on their own territory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
