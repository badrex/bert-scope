The author discusses the effects of various elements, such as antimony, tin, nickel, chromium, and manganese, on the embrittlement process and their interactions with each other. The article also highlights the importance of understanding these processes to improve the properties of steel materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
