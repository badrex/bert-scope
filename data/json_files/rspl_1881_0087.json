They found that most of the widened lines in the solar spectrum are not represented in the spectra of terrestrial elements, and that the number of new lines seen among the most widened lines has been steadily increasing. This research contributes to understanding solar activity and the behavior of spectral lines in sunspots.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Solar Physics"}
