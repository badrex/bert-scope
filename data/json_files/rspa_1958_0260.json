They found a ratio of the cross-sections of boron and hydrogen, which helped determine the cross-section of hydrogen for capture of thermal neutrons. This research contributed to understanding the range of nuclear forces in the singlet state of the neutron-proton system and testing the hypothesis of charge independence of nuclear forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
