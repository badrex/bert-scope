The authors present numerical results and curves for their electrometer and provide a more accurate formula for the effective area when the disk is in the plane of the guard-ring. They also investigate the error in the ordinary assumption of the effective area when the disk and guard-ring are not in the same plane.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
