They demonstrate that periodogram analysis is less effective when dealing with disturbed data, and propose an alternative approach to account for disturbances in the data. The author finds that the graph of sunspot numbers is smooth with varying amplitudes and phases, suggesting that the data is more complex than simple periodic fluctuations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climatology"}
