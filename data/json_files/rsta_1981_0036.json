The authors demonstrate how incorporating selective excitation into the multiple-quantum Fourier-transform nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) experiment leads to increased signal intensities, particularly in proton NMR of molecules orientated in liquid crystals. The information content of multiple-quantum NMR spectra of dipolar-coupled spins is also compared with the alternative of isotopic labeling experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
