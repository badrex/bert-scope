They demonstrated that a net inward current occurs in the terminals at sites of transmitter release. This discovery has important implications for the release of neurotransmitter and the mechanisms governing the spatial distribution of ion-selective channels in the mammalian nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuromuscular Junction"}
