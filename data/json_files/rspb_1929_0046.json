The researchers used a galvanometer to measure the deflection and time of the athletes' first movement, aiming to understand factors affecting performance. The results showed that the maximum speed of the athletes varied, but the initial movement was consistent with their overall speed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
