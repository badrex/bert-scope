The authors explore the challenges and potential solutions for high-speed imaging, including improving receiver recovery time, generating large field gradients, and optimizing data collection methods. They present an example of an image obtained using their method and discuss its potential medical applications, such as early detection of congenital anomalies in premature babies.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Biomedical Engineering"}
