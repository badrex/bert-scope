They introduce the concept of local proton potentials and discuss the differences between solitons generated using various potentials. The study focuses on the Lippincott-Schroeder potential and its impact on the solitonic mechanism and the contribution of hydrogen bonding. The authors also estimate the Peierls-Nabarro barrier and analyze its changes when the heavier subsystem is relaxed upon proton quasi-kink formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular interactions"}
