The authors developed a new method to determine molecular weights using the relationship between vapour pressure and density. The study provides a comprehensive table of densities for sodium chloride solutions, accurate within five decimal places, and suggests that this method could be useful for determining molecular weights in other cases, such as with organic solvents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
