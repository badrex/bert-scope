The authors analyze radiocarbon data from tree rings, specifically bristlecone pine wood, to study the impact of solar activity on Earth's climate. They discovered a periodicity of about 200 years in the 14C variations, which they attribute to solar activity. This research provides insights into the Earth's climate history and the role of solar activity in climate change.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
