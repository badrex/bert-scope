The author examines the conditions for strong ellipticity in the system of equilibrium equations for the deformation and explores their implications for the displacement boundary-value problem. It is found that strong ellipticity is sufficient but not necessary for uniqueness of solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
