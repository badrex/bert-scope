The results show that lepadomorphs have higher haemolymph pressures than balanomorphs, with maximum pressures being sustainable. The research also discusses the implications of an expansive haemolymph system and low absolute pressures in balanomorph evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
