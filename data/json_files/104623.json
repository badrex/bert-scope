They discover that the glass drops acquire their unique properties when red-hot glass is plunged into cold water, causing the particles to be separated by a large amount of fiery particles. The author explains that the annealing process, which involves heating the glass to a moderate temperature, keeps the pores open and prevents the glass from breaking. This understanding can be applied to other fused substances as well.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Glass Science"}
