The research focuses on the relationship between sediment composition, pollen spectra, and diatom content to provide insights into the area's vegetation and climate changes over the past 15,000 years. The findings reveal the impact of environmental factors on soil maturation and vegetation development, as well as the effects of human activities on the landscape.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoenvironmental history"}
