The results suggest differences in calcium-buffering mechanisms in the two types of axons. The research provides insights into the pathways taken by calcium ions during synaptic activity and the effects of calcium on synapse structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
