The authors found that the chemical composition of the mixed herbage was dependent on the supplies within the soil, the botanical composition, and the description of plants encouraged. They discovered that nitrogenous manures increased the production of non-nitrogenous bodies in the mixed herbage, and that the mineral composition was directly dependent on the available supplies within the soil.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Chemistry"}
