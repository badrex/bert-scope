They discovered that betaine is toxic and can cause cardiac arrest in animals. The authors also found that commercial betaine is more potent than betaine extracted from beet-sugar. This research contradicts the previous belief that betaine is non-toxic.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alkaloids and Toxicology"}
