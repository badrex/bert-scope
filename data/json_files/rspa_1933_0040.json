The authors found that the decomposition process involves a quiescent period followed by rapid acceleration, and that the critical temperature for detonation varies depending on experimental conditions. The findings contribute to the understanding of the properties and behavior of mercury fulminate and related compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and thermodynamics"}
