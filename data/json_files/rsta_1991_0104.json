The author explains how neotectonic joints can provide valuable information about the orientations of principal stress axes and how they can be used to infer the stress field in a region. The study focuses on examples from the Ebro basin in Spain and the S. England/N. France region, comparing the directions of greatest horizontal stress inferred from joint systems with those determined from geophysical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
