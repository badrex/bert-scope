He discusses the impact of a great cosmical change that affected all phenomena of terrestrial magnetism during this period. The study also highlights the changes in the magnitude and form of diurnal curves representing the hourly magnetic forces in the horizontal plane.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Earth's Magnetic Field"}
