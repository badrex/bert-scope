They use a system of linear equations to obtain a complete solution, which is divided into particular integrals and a complementary function. The study finds that the drag is associated with an irrotational solution, and the lift is connected to diffused trailing vortices in the fluid. This research provides a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics and the forces acting on objects in a fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
