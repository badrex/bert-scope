The presence of low-altitude woodland mosses Neckera complanata and crispa suggests that the Iceman came from the south (modern Italy) rather than the north (Austria). This discovery helps to determine the Iceman's origin and provides insight into the palaeoenvironment of the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoenvironment"}
