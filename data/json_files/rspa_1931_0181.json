They analyze the motion of the liquid, the vorticity, and the stream function to determine the resistance to the motion. The research provides a mathematical understanding of the fluid dynamics involved in this specific scenario.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
