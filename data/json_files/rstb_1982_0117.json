It shows that interferon induces the development of an antiviral state in cells against exogenous infections of cytolytic viruses. However, in some cases, the antiviral effects of interferon are virus-specific. The study also highlights the inhibition of retrovirus production by interferon and its correlation with non-antiviral actions on cell membranes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
