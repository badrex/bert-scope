The researchers found that the flagellate stage of the parasite can withstand exposure to temperatures as low as -12\u00b0C for at least 10 days. This discovery suggests that Leishmania may be able to persist in the environment during winter, possibly within the alimentary tract of hibernating insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
