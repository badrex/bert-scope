He found that porous vessels could create a frigorific effect, which might explain how ice forms even when the air temperature is above the freezing point. He also studied the cooling effects of tatties, mats made of fresh green bushes or long roots, which were used to cool houses by promoting evaporation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Thermodynamics"}
