ES cells allow for the introduction of dominant and recessive genetic alterations, targeted mutagenesis, and the generation of chimeras to analyze the effects of these alterations. The potential of ES cells in studying gene function and understanding developmental processes is highlighted, making them a valuable resource in modern biology research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
