The authors introduce an 'emission function' that characterizes the angular variation of the outgoing field, and they show that the surface-wave amplitude is equal to the value of this function at a complex angle. The method can be applied to various types of sources and geometries, providing a means to analyze surface wave excitation by combining ray theory with integral representation of the wave field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave mechanics"}
