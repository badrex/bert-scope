V. Walters and H. Hartridge examines the trichromatic theory of vision using an improved Wright trichromatic colorimeter. They discuss the assumptions in the method for determining the fundamental response curves and report new observations where von Kries's law of coefficients breaks down. The authors analyze the possible physiological causes and attempt to locate colors in the trichromatic color chart and derive the response curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Visual Perception"}
