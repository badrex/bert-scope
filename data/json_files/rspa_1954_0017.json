The authors investigate the intensity distribution of the patterns at different scattering angles and explore the effects of various parameters, such as the energy of incident electrons and the angle of incidence. The results show that the intensity of the patterns decreases with increasing scattering angle, and the efficiency of electron scattering is higher for crystals with heavier atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
