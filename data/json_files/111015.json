The author examines the anatomy of the stomach's muscular coat and the actions of the digestive stomach. The study also explores the two currents in the stomach's liquid contents and how they relate to the intestinal tube. The author presents a theory on the physical process of obstruction and its effects on the digestive system, including the occurrence of fecal vomiting.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
