Schunck, discovered that oxalurate of ammonia is a constituent of human urine. They found that when urine is treated with animal charcoal, several organic substances are separated, including oxalurate of ammonia. The substance has a composition of C1-1N3O and can be derived from uric acid. The presence of oxalurate of ammonia in urine helps explain the formation of oxalate of lime after urine emission."}
