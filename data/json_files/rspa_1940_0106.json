They found that all points in the lattice become circles, and the portions of each circle that should reflect on a given photograph corresponded precisely to the photographs. The main orders showed interesting intensity variations, with the first four orders having the highest relative intensities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
