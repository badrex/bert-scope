This method overcomes difficulties in calculating the Stark effect and van der Waals attraction of atoms at large distances, and can be extended to more complicated atoms. The alternative method also provides insight into what is neglected in the usual successive approximations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum mechanics"}
