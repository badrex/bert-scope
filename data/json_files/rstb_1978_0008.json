These variations are believed to be due to sensory lines becoming anchored to different combinations of bone rudiments during skeletogenesis. The study provides insights into the development and evolution of sensory systems in these ancient fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolution and Development of Organisms"}
