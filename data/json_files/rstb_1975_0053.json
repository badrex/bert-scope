The authors found that hyaluronic acid reduces the incorporation of sulfate into macromolecular material, suggesting that it interacts with proteoglycans at the cell surface, affecting the secretion and synthesis of proteoglycans in cartilage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
