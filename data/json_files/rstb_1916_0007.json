They compare the monotreme skulls to those of cynodonts, finding similarities in their mammalian structure. The study provides insights into the affinities and differences between monotremes and other mammals, contributing to the understanding of mammalian morphogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalian Morphogenesis"}
