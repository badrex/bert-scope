The authors summarize current knowledge of the gas exchange coefficient and explore methods for calculating the basin-wide uptake by exploiting information about the general circulation of the North Atlantic. They estimate a value for the North Atlantic's carbon dioxide uptake, which helps in understanding the global carbon budget and the impact of climate change."}
