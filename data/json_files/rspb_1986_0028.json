The results show that growth rates are generally higher in red light, while blue light reduces growth rates in most strains. The algae's pigmentation also changes depending on the light quality, with a decline in pigment levels in red light and variations in phycobiliprotein ratios. This research highlights the importance of understanding the underwater light climate and its influence on the growth and pigmentation of blue-green algae in natural environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Algal Biology"}
