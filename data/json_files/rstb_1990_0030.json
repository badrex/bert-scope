It explores the factors affecting protein stability, such as temperature, pH, and low water activity, and how proteins adapt to these conditions. The article also highlights the importance of understanding protein structure and function for low-temperature adaptation and the challenges in predicting the effect of temperature on protein structure and function due to the diverse nature of proteins."}
