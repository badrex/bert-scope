The researchers found that double cones containing two different visual pigments show reciprocal signal transmission between the two cone members. This suggests a role in luminosity and wavelength detection, and the findings support the idea that the close membrane apposition in double cones subserves reciprocal transmission between cells of the tench retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
