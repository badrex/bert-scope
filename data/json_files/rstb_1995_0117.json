It explains how actin and tubulin escape equilibrium constraints by using nucleotide hydrolysis to drive polymerization dynamics and force production. The thermal ratchet model is proposed as a primitive force-generating mechanism for intracellular motile processes. The author argues that dynamics preceded motors in evolution, with the earliest forms of motility driven by polymerization dynamics of the ancestors of modern actin and tubulin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cytoskeleton"}
