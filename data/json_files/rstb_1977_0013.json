It highlights the enigmatic nature of achiasmate meiosis, where some species achieve regular meiotic disjunction without chiasmata. The article also explores the evolutionary significance of this phenomenon and the various factors that may contribute to its occurrence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
