The research utilizes a calorimeter with enhanced temperature uniformity and better thermal contact, allowing for more accurate measurements and slower gas flow rates. The results provide a better understanding of the specific heat ratios of these gases at various temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
