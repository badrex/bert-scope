They illustrate this claim by discussing current psycholinguistic studies of two forms of acquired dyslexia: phonological dyslexia and surface dyslexia. The author uses a psycholinguistic account of normal reading as a theoretical framework to define and explain the patterns of deficit and preservation observed in these two dyslexias. This framework helps to predict the nature of surface dyslexia in other languages and confirms these predictions in a case of an English-Spanish bilingual.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Neuropsychology"}
