This process is influenced by light and continues even in the dark. Carbonic acid is not released during the healthy condition of the leaf, and the first portions of carbonic acid gas are taken up more eagerly by plants than the remaining portions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
