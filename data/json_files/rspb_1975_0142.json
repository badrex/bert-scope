The research focuses on the modification of the spermatid cells into mature spermatozoa, the unique morphology of their sperm, and the membrane organization in the mid-piece region. The findings reveal similarities in the morphology of the three species and the use of the freeze-etching technique to study their membrane systems and condensed nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
