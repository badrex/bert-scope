They observed 350 tumors, mainly mammary adenocarcinomas, and found that cancer in mice is similar to cancer in humans. The study also highlights the importance of factors other than physiological demands on the mammary glands in the development of cancer. The authors suggest that inflammation and other pathological changes in the mammary glands may be linked to the presence of nematodes in the subcutaneous tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Research"}
