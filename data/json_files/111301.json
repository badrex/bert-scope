The survey used triangulation methods to create accurate maps and calculate the Earth's size and shape. The author also compares different methods of measuring the Earth's specific gravity and discusses the importance of using a standard yard for geodetic measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
