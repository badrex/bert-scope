The authors investigate relaxation processes in viscous solutions, finding that the dominant mechanism is intermolecular, not due to a dipolar field. They also demonstrate how the broadening patterns in NMR spectra can reveal relative signs of coupling constants, providing insights into relaxation mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
