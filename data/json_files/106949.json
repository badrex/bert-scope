The author explains that their membranous bags possess a similar power to human muscles, suggesting that the principle of action in living animals is more extensive and simple than previously imagined. This finding challenges the theories of muscular motion based on complex muscle structures and encourages further investigation into the principles of muscular action in simpler organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Anatomy and Physiology"}
