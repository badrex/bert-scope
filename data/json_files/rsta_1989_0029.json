It explains how the magnetosphere's influence on the ionosphere and thermosphere is evident in disturbances such as plasma density, wind, temperature, and composition. The study uses observational data and numerical simulations to understand the complex interactions and their effects on the Earth's upper atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
