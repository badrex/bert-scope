The technique removes line broadening due to dipolar interactions and enhances the intrinsic low NMR sensitivity, allowing for the study of chemical shift tensors in organic single crystals. The author discusses the experimental setup, data analysis, and applications of this method in determining the chemical shift tensors of various organic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
