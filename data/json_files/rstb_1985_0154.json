They demonstrate a direct coupling between the indirect flight muscles and a wing base stop mechanism, and describe the anatomical basis of automatic wing stroke changes during the wingbeat. The study provides a functional characterization of the non-fibrillar muscles and suggests an aerodynamic function for the calypters, structures previously not proposed for this role.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
