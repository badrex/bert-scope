The authors used computer models to study the meteorological conditions and interpret radiological measurements. They assessed the quantities of released nuclides and identified contaminated areas in Europe, estimating the collective dose to the population outside the USSR. The study provides an understanding of how contaminated air circulated across Europe and helped in interpreting the measurements taken after the disaster.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Pollution"}
