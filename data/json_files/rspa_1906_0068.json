The dredging operations increased the depth and width of the channel, allowing larger ships to navigate the river more easily. The study compares tidal curves from 1893 and 1903, showing little to no difference in the range of the tide and the form of the curve, indicating the success of the dredging efforts.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography and Coastal Studies"}
