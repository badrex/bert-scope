They calculated the total energy, potential and kinetic energies, and dipole and quadrupole moments to analyze the behavior of the molecule at large nuclear separations. The results were compared with exact and variationally determined two-center wave functions, providing insights into the accuracy of approximate methods in molecular systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
