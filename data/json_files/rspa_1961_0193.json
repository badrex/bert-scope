The authors assume that the forces hindering rotation around the carbon-carbon bonds are equal and independent of each other. They also consider the introduction of a polar group into the molecule, which makes the torsional vibrations active in the absorption spectrum. The results can be used to derive approximate expressions for the absorption spectrum due to torsional vibrations in dipolar long-chain substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
