They found that the observed ground-state splitting for Mn can only be accounted for by this model if the Racah parameter A is about 30% larger than the observed value for Fe in a similar crystal environment. The study provides insights into the relationship between the ground-state splitting and optical absorption spectrum of Mn ions in cubic host crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
