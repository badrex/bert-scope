The results show that the pituitary preparations can stimulate oestrin production and follicular maturation in atrophied ovaries, leading to the resumption of normal reproductive functions. This suggests that both vitamin B deficiency and lowered calorific intake contribute to ovarian atrophy and anoestrus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
