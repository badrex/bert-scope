He discusses the role of dielectrics, such as air, in the process of induction and conduction. Faraday also examines the differences in conducting power among various substances and how they affect the discharge of electricity. He proposes that induction and conduction are actions of contiguous particles and are governed by a common law.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
