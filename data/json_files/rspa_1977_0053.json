The study focuses on two-dimensional turbulent flows, where vorticity is a conserved transferable property. The author demonstrates that the theory does not ensure the conservation of momentum, which is a crucial aspect of fluid dynamics. This finding has implications for understanding and modeling turbulent flows in various applications, such as oceanography and meteorology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
