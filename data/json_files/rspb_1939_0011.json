The authors found that after exercise, there is a reduction in glucose tolerance and a delay in the rise of the respiratory quotient. They also discovered that a high-carbohydrate diet has little effect on glucose tolerance, while a low-carbohydrate, high-fat diet significantly decreases it. These findings suggest that the activity of endocrine organs associated with carbohydrate metabolism may be correlated with the varying activity of muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
