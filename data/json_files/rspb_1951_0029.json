The research compares dental dimensions between the African and St Kitts green monkeys with other subspecies and species of the Cercopithecus genus. The findings show that the St Kitts green monkey's dental dimensions have increased significantly during the last 300 years, with the speed of change being much faster than the estimated rate of evolution in horses over millions of years.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
