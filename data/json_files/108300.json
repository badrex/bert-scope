They conclude that these cells are analogous to the endogenous cells of other glands, such as the pancreas, and play a role in the production of bile. This study provides insight into the anatomical and physiological relationship between hepatic cells and the hepatic ducts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
