They overcome challenges in temperature measurement and the uncertainty of the thermal unit, leading to a more accurate determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat. The study also highlights the importance of using consistent and reliable methods for measuring temperature and electrical resistance in calorimetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
