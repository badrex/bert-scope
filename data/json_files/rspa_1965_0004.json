The authors investigate a double-diaphragm shock tube with unheated hydrogen as the driver gas and a detonable gas in the middle section. They find that detonation conditions can be optimized to produce uniformly driven shocks, which can be useful for high-temperature gas research and studying gas dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Gas Dynamics"}
