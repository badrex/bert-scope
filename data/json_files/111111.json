Carpenter, explores the correlation between vital and physical forces in living organisms. He argues that vital forces, such as assimilation, organization, and chemico-vital transformation, are all modes of one force responsible for cell-formation. He also demonstrates that the nervous and muscular forces are influenced by this vital force. Furthermore, he establishes a connection between vital forces and physical forces like electricity, heat, light, chemical affinity, and mechanical motion, suggesting that they are closely related.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology and Biochemistry"}
