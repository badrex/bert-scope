The authors discuss the role of organic matter in driving reactions and the importance of burial rate and pore-water chemistry in controlling the sequence of reactions. They also examine the characteristics of diagenetic minerals and their potential to provide information about the environment of growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
