The research found that cotton leaves exposed to intense sunlight did not suffer photoinhibitory damage, and the intrinsic photon yield of photosynthetic evolution remained high and constant throughout the growing season. The results show that cotton plants can tolerate large excesses of excitation energy due to their high capacity to dissipate excessive energy via non-radiative energy dissipation, protecting the photosynthetic reaction centers from over-excitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
