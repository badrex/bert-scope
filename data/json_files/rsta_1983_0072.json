The authors explain how these mineralizers facilitate the sintering reactions in the cement-making process, resulting in higher early strength properties. They also describe the influence of mineralizers on the reaction sequence during firing and the formation of intermediate phases. The potential benefits of using mineralizers, such as fuel savings and improved cement quality, are also considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
