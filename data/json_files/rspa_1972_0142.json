The study examines how the distribution and environment of copper ions change upon adsorption of various molecules, such as carbon monoxide, cyclopropane, and 3,3-dimethylbutene. The results provide insights into the catalytic behavior of the material and the role of transition metal complexes in catalytic reactions over these solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
