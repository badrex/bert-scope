They treat the directional forces as a perturbation on the central forces and provide expressions for the second virial coefficient due to various types of directional forces. The theory is illustrated by some calculations on the force field of carbon dioxide and its relation to the second virial coefficient and crystal data.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
