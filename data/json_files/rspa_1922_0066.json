The heating of tungsten and platinum wires in the gas is due to the catalytic action of their surfaces in recombining hydrogen atoms. The author also discusses the generation of molecular hydrogen from atomic hydrogen and the role of oxygen in preventing the formation of atomic hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
