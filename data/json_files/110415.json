He demonstrates that the electricity produced is due to chemical action and that the intensity of the electric current is necessary for the decomposition of electrolytes. Faraday also examines the voltaic battery and its ability to conduct electricity through various substances, showing how the number of plates in the battery affects its power and energy."}
