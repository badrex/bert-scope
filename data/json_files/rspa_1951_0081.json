They show that by understanding the characteristic temperatures and volumes of single substances, it is possible to estimate the deviation from perfection in mixtures of slightly imperfect gases at low pressures. This approach can be useful for predicting the behavior of gases in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
