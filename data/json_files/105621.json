Planman observed the transit of Venus over the Sun from Cajaneburg in Sweden. Peter Wargentin, Secretary to the Royal Academy of Sciences in Sweden, reported the observation and its corrections. The observations were used to calculate the difference in meridians between Stockholm and Cajaneburg, and to correct the time of the interior contact of the limbs of Venus and the Sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
