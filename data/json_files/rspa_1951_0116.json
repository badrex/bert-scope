They discuss the process of obtaining a homogeneous pellicle and an optically flat gelatine surface, and present the results of their experiments, showing that the diffracted wave-fronts of the parent and replica gratings agree to a fraction of a fringe.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optical Engineering"}
