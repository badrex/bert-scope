They found that attempts to repeat Berthelot's absorption of helium by carbon bisulphide under the silent electric discharge were unsuccessful. However, helium was slightly absorbed by phosphorus under electric discharge, but in much smaller quantities than nitrogen or hydrogen. The absorption in these cases is considered mechanical and chemical, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
