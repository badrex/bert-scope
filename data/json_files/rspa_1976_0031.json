The He 1 photoelectron spectra for both compounds are discussed, comparing them with Gaussian ab initio molecular orbital calculations and the spectra of dissociated species. The authors also explore the relation to nitric acid and consider possible geometrical structures for dinitrogen pentoxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
