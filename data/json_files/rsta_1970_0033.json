The study confirms previous hypotheses that strongly magnetic rocks underlie the axial trough and provides various seafloor spreading models that could account for the inferred motion. The results reveal a remarkable similarity between the axial trough and mid-ocean ridge crests.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
