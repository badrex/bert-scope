The ALEPH detector, designed to test electroweak theory, focuses on the charged gauge boson, its mass, and its couplings to fermions. The detector's performance is described, and its tracking system and calorimetry, including the large time projection chamber and the electromagnetic calorimeter, are detailed. The experiment's data acquisition, monitoring, and calibration systems are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
