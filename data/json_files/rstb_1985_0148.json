It discusses the factors that control pyrite formation, such as the supply of organic matter, sulfate, and iron. The study examines various examples of Jurassic shales and their unique preservation styles, highlighting the importance of collaboration between paleontologists, sedimentologists, and geochemists to extract the maximum information from shale-hosted fossil sites.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
