The authors found that fleece conductance increased with windspeed, with a more pronounced effect on the windward side of the model. The results indicate that the angle of the sheep to the wind has little effect on the average conductance, and the fleece resistance is inversely proportional to its depth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Animal Behavior"}
