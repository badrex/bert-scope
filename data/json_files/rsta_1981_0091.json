The focus is on the recombination scheme, which involves rapid cooling of a strongly ionized plasma, leading to recombination into upper excited states of the ion. This method has been observed in visible spectral regions but is now being explored for extreme ultraviolet laser action. The article also covers theoretical considerations for constructing a working laser and the challenges involved in achieving high pump power densities and short pulse durations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
