The authors discuss the influence of the polar front's migration and its impact on the climate and vegetation during the late Quaternary period. They also review the available palynological data from various sedimentary environments, focusing on lacustrine and bog deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
