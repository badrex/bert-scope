They discovered that the leech's stomach has multiple caeca that help in blood circulation and respiration. The author also conducted experiments to understand the leech's respiration mode and found that it releases bubbles of air and produces carbonic acid when deprived of air. This research provides insights into the leech's anatomy and its unique respiratory and circulatory systems compared to higher animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
