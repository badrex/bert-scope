They found that nutrition plays a role in haemoglobin synthesis, with the content increasing with the amount of algal food consumed up to a certain level. The study also revealed that chlorophyll in the food does not favor haemoglobin synthesis, and that the haemoglobin content varies within each stage of the Daphnia's life cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Environmental and Earth Sciences"}
