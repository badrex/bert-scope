The author, George Massee, explains that the disease is caused by a minute organism related to fungi, Plasmodiophora brassicae. The disease is influenced by the amount of lime in the soil, with low lime content promoting the disease. The author also shares experiments conducted at Kew, demonstrating the effects of different soil treatments on the development of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
