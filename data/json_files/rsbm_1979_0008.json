His work provided essential information for studying genetic replication of enzymes and structural proteins, and paved the way for understanding the spatial configuration of proteins and their interactions with solvents. Edman's dedication to his research and his contributions to the field of protein sequencing are commemorated in this biographical memoir.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
