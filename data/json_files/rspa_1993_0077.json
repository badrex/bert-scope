The authors develop a thermohydrodynamic analysis that accounts for temporal and spatial variations of temperature in the lubricant, bearing, and journal due to synchronous journal orbits. The study establishes a relation between the orbit and the steady-state temperature differential across the journal, resulting in steady-state rotor bending. The findings have implications for understanding and addressing unstable vibrations in rotating machines, particularly in high-speed machines and industrial gas turbines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
