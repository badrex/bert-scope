They analyze the temperature and intensity distribution in the flame, providing a new point of reference for shadowgraphs when the distance between the flame and screen is significant. This research helps in understanding the behavior of flames and refining combustion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
