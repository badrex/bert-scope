The study found that abnormal environmental conditions or treatments, such as washing, hypertonicity, hypotonicity, and dilution, elicited a shock reaction characterized by depressed metabolism, followed by a gradual recovery or adaptation. The results suggest that the rate of anaerobic heat production declines before substrate exhaustion or a reduction in the concentration of the medium affects sperm metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
