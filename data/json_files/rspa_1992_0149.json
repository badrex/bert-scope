They solve Laplace's equation and demand that the gravitational potential be a quantum operator. The resulting potentials display singularity structures similar to Kerr's solutions in general relativity, but incorporating non-relativistic quantum mechanics removes the singularity for sources with spins 1.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
