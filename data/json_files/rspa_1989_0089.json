The authors extend a previous analysis to include the effect of ion diffusion and present solutions for both one-dimensional and two-dimensional cases. They find that the addition of the diffusion term changes the structure of the solution and provides a partial explanation for the behavior at low currents. The results help to improve our understanding of the underlying physics of flame ionization detectors."}
