They found that dislocation structures, such as prismatic loops, Orowan loops, and groups of dipoles, are formed around the particles. The formation of these structures is explained by a cross-slip mechanism controlled by interstitial misfit strains around the particles. The number of prismatic loops generated decreases with temperature, which is explained by pipe or interface diffusion-controlled climb of dislocations at the particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
