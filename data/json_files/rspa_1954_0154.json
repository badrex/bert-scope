They use mathematical models and series expansions to understand the complex flow patterns and interactions between the primary and secondary waves. This study provides valuable insights into the behavior of blast waves and can help improve understanding and safety measures in explosive events.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
