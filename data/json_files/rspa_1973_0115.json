They observed a broad transmission maximum centered at about 80 \u00c5 and reported new features in the spectrum due to excitation from the 4f and 5s subshells. The results provide insights into the structure of the Hgi absorption spectrum and the energy dependence of photoionization cross-sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
