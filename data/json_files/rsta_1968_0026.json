They explore various noise sources, such as magnetostriction, windage noise, and mechanical noise, and propose strategies for noise reduction, including enclosure design and vibration isolation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Acoustics and Vibration"}
