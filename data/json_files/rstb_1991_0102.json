This finding indicates that the formation of nitric oxide from L-arginine is a pathway of early evolutionary origin and suggests that nitric oxide may play a role in regulating the haemostatic function of haemocytes, similar to human platelets.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Arthropod Biology"}
