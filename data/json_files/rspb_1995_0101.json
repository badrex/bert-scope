They find that moderate levels of parasitoid aggregation promote the formation of spiral structures, which have important consequences for the persistence of the interaction and the fitness of parasitoids. The study also investigates the effects of multiple episodes of parasitoid dispersal per generation on the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Population Biology"}
