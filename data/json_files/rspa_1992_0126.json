The authors used various techniques, including a drop-weight apparatus and a direct impact Hopkinson bar, to measure stress-strain curves at different strain rates and temperatures. They found that conventional compositions were the most sensitive to impact, and all compositions containing gas spaces were sensitized. The results provide mechanical data for hydrocode modeling of impact initiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
