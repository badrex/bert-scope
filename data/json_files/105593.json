The phenomenon appeared as a \"Mock-Sun\" opposite to the real sun and was visible for about 18 minutes. The author discussed the possible causes of the anthelion, such as the presence of icy or snowy particles in the air refracting or reflecting solar rays. The author also mentioned the need for more observations to perfect the theory of anthelia.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
