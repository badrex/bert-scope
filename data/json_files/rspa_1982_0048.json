The research uses molecularly smooth mica substrates and various normal aliphatic carboxylic acids and their soaps, deposited with the Langmuir-Blodgett technique. The results show that most monolayers provide a continuous rate of energy dissipation and that the interface shear strength is influenced by contact variables such as normal load, temperature, and sliding velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Chemistry"}
