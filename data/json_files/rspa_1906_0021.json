They discovered that the secondary radiation proceeding from carbon in a direction perpendicular to the primary radiation's propagation is polarized, providing evidence for the theory of secondary X-rays production in substances of low atomic weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
