They discovered that the hydride spectrum is highly complex and can be obtained with great intensity using this method. The high-frequency flame discharge also produces a unique spectrum that differs from the spark and arc spectra. The authors observed the presence of two pairs of sharp lines, which they named the \"F and P\" lines, in the magnesium spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
