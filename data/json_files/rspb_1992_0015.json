It explores the roles of different T-cell subsets, cytokines, and host-pathogen interactions in resistance and susceptibility to infection. The authors propose a model that can mimic observed patterns of resistance and T-cell proliferation in response to various parasites, suggesting a common mechanism of inhibition underlying these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
