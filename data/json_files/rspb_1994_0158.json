It compares length selectivity for each eye in strongly binocular, striate cortical neurons in adult cats. The results show that many neurons have different optimal length and/or end stopping for each eye, with a marked tendency for receptive fields to be relatively smaller on average but more strongly end-stopped for contralateral input. These findings may provide a basis for encoding visual perspective cues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
