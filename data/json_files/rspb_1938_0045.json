Researchers found that when stick insects are raised on ivy, they prefer to eat ivy over privet. The study also shows that this preference can be passed down to the next generation, demonstrating the influence of parental food habits on offspring.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
