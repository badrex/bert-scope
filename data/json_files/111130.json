Sabine's study of the mean effects of larger magnetic disturbances found periodical laws in the occurrence and effects of these disturbances. The study confirmed that these disturbances affect the globe simultaneously and have a connection with the seasons of the year and hours of the day. The findings have implications for understanding the causes of periodical variations of terrestrial magnetism, including the diurnal magnetic variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Magnetism"}
