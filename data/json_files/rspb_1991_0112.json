The study shows that these molecules increase phagocytosis and cause the release of biogenic amines in molluscs, supporting the hypothesis that immune and neuroendocrine systems share a common evolutionary origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology and Neuroscience"}
