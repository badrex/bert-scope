The authors report on the resistivity and Hall coefficient of these metals in fields up to 25. They find that the theoretical form of the conductivity tensor in high fields, based on the relaxation time assumption, is in qualitative disagreement with experimental results. The authors discuss possible causes of the discrepancy and conclude that it probably arises from the assumption that a relaxation time exists and is independent of the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
