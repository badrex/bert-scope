The author discovers uric acid in the renal organs of starfishes, proving their renal function. Additionally, the author examines the secretions of the salivary glands in cuttlefish and limpets, finding that they contain enzymes that break down starch and produce glucose, as well as mucin and sulphocyanates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
