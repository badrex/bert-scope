It provides data on environmental parameters and standing crop, as well as a detailed study on the recolonization of Scytonema sp. over a six-month period. Blue-green algae are found to be abundant in both terrestrial and freshwater environments in the atoll, and their success is attributed to their ability to thrive in calcareous environments and high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
