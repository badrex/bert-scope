The research aims to improve the strength, ductility, and creep resistance of these materials for use in jet engines and other high-temperature environments. The article highlights the potential of multiphase alloys to overcome the brittleness of single-phase intermetallics and presents advances in nickel aluminides and iron aluminides as promising materials for high-temperature applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Intermetallic Compounds"}
