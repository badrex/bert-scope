They discover distinct zones within the nucleus, including a peripheral zone, a middle zone, and a nucleolus with an outer region and an inner core. The study suggests that the middle zone and nucleolar core are not artifacts and may contain proteins and ribonucleic acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
