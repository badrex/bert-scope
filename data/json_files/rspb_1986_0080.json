It shows that faster growth rates are evident in more heterozygous mussels due to decreased energy requirements for maintenance. This is associated with higher efficiencies of protein synthesis and lower intensities of nitrogen metabolism. The findings suggest that genotype may play a role in mediating intraspecific variations of growth among animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
