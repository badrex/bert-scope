The authors develop a theoretical framework that combines the effects of atmospheric oblateness and diurnal variation to determine the variation in the inclination of the orbital plane. The results can be used to improve understanding of the motion of satellites in near-circular orbits at altitudes greater than 200 km.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aerospace Engineering"}
