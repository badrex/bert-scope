The symptoms are particularly noticeable when the patient is sitting or standing, but improve when lying down. The author suggests that paracenthesis, a surgical procedure to remove excess fluid, may be a viable treatment option for this condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Respiratory System"}
