They used an excellent sector to trace out a parallel of latitude and made astronomical observations at both ends of the lines. The method they used was capable of great exactness, and their measure of a degree is considered valuable for further research on the figure of the earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
