They tested the Stefan's law, which states that radiation of heat is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the radiating surface. The author's method involved measuring the electric current, resistance, and dimensions of the wire to calculate the loss of heat per square centimeter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
