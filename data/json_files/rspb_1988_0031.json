The results show that the average lifetime of sodium channels in cultured Schwann cells is about 3.1 days. The research also demonstrates that exposure to tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation, leads to a decrease in saxitoxin-binding capacity, further supporting the rapid turnover of sodium channels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
