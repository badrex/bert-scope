It concludes that species data are more valuable for accurate assessment of taxon component of biodiversity and are essential for conservation planning. The study highlights the importance of considering species distribution, centers of endemism, and local demography in the assessment of neotropical biodiversity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Biodiversity"}
