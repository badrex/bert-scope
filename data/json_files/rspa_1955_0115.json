They find that thirteen bonding orbitals hold the icosahedron together, and use their findings to discuss the stability of boron carbide, question a proposed crystal structure for elementary boron, and consider the possibility of a hydride B12H12.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
