They found that the reaction rates were first order in ethylene pressure and that the catalyst's activity increased with pretreatment time, reaching a maximum before declining due to over-reduction. The results suggest that active sites on the catalyst surface are produced during contact with ethylene at 300\u00b0C, and that these sites can be reactivated by adsorbing ethylene at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
