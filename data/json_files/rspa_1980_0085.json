They derive modified amplitude equations and calculate modified critical Rayleigh numbers. The study shows that the horizontal wavenumber of the solution is uniquely determined, which is different from the classical Benard problem where the wavenumber is a free parameter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
