Trigonobalanus has unique leaf whorls and is significant in understanding the taxonomy of the Fagaceae family. The authors suggest that Quercus, a related genus, evolved from Trigonobalanus-like ancestors. Trigonobalanus also shares similarities with fossil species found in Baltic amber.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
