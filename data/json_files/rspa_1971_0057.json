They find that the convective coefficient is time-dependent, even in steady velocity fields, due to non-uniform initial solute distribution. The model can be applied to various practical cases, such as interphase heat or mass transfer, and provides a more accurate estimation of mean flow rates by tracer techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
