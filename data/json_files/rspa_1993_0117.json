The authors discuss the existence of discontinuities in the fatigue fracture kinetic diagrams and the appearance of an intermediate asymptotic self-similar regime during crack propagation. They propose a model to explain these phenomena and highlight the importance of understanding these processes for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
