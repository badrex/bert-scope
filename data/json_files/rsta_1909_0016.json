They classify continuous symmetric functions into three categories: ambiguous type, positive type, and negative type. The author also demonstrates that functions of positive or negative type can be expanded as a series of products of normal functions, and that this series converges both absolutely and uniformly.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Function Theory"}
