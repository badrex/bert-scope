They compared the experimental values of the viscosity and second virial coefficients with theoretical values using different statistics, such as Boltzmann, Fermi-Dirac, and Bose-Einstein. Their findings showed that Bose-Einstein statistics were the most suitable for describing helium atoms, and they provided insights into the interaction of helium atoms and the validity of quantum theory at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
