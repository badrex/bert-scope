The researchers studied the effect of adding an ester, cetyl palmitate, to the paraffin wax and observed that the power factor temperature curve passes through a maximum, which is independent of frequency. The results show that the dielectric loss increases with the addition of the ester, and the power factor values are influenced by the type of paraffin wax medium and the polar molecule added.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
