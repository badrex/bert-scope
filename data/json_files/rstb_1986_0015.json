The authors recognize several vole species and describe two new species, Mimomys pitymyoides and Mimomys gensis, for the first time from Britain. The research helps clarify the relative position of the Bramertonian and Pre-Pastonian stages and contributes to the understanding of the British Lower Pleistocene assemblages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
