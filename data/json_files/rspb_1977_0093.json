The researchers found that infections were always heavier in the pylorus than the ileum, and the parasites became attached to the cuticular intima lining the hindgut. The unique development of the braziliensis complex in the pylorus and ileum of the sandfly is thought to be the preliminary establishment of an infection where the parasites initially multiply before migrating forwards to the foregut and proboscis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
