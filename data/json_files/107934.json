They also discuss the effect of a resisting medium on celestial orbits, explaining how it can cause changes in eccentricities and the major axes of orbits. The author uses examples from comets and the precession of the equinoxes to illustrate these effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
