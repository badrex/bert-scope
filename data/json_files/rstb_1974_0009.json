Watson's Pterosaur Research and Notes", "semantic_tags": ["Paleontology", "Pterosaurs", "Biomechanics", "Aerodynamics", "Evolution"], "tldr": "This article discusses the notes, drawings, and calculations made by D. M. S. Watson on pterosaurs, focusing on his study of Pteranodon and its aerodynamic design. Watson believed pterosaurs were highly efficient mechanisms with structures that conformed to rigid and determinable limits. He examined bone thickness, wing spread, articulations, and wing loading, and considered the possibility of pterosaurs soaring like albatrosses. Unfortunately, Watson did not continue his research, leaving us with a tantalizing glimpse into his groundbreaking ideas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
