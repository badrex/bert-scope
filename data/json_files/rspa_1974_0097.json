By stretching the material before crystallization, a range of crystalline morphologies were created. The tensile behavior of these semi-crystalline samples was compared to non-crystalline natural rubber. It was found that the amorphous phase dominates the tensile behavior, while crystalline morphology affects the properties at temperatures below the glass transition temperature. The research differentiates the effects of crystallinity, crystalline morphology, and orientation of the amorphous phase on the tensile properties of natural rubber.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Polymer Science"}
