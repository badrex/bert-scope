The method involves finding two lines whose sum or difference is given and are reciprocal to two given lines. The author provides a step-by-step process for solving problems using this method, including rules for proceeding in a geometric investigation and introducing a common ratio in two proportions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
