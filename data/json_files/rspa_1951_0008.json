The research focuses on the effect of temperature on the orientation of these films, revealing a transition temperature at which the films lose their characteristic orientation. The findings provide insights into the properties of thin films in contact with metal substrates and their role in boundary lubrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
