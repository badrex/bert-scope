They use a method of successive approximation to the solution of hydrodynamical equations and find strong evidence for the existence of periodic stationary waves and a finite stable wave of greatest height. The study also examines the wave pressure on a breakwater and the modification of calculations for finite water depth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
