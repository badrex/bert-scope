They discovered that the temperature of a healthy human body can vary depending on factors such as time of day, exercise, and environmental conditions. The study found that body temperature is generally highest after waking up, decreases throughout the day, and reaches its lowest point at night. Active exercise was also found to increase body temperature, while passive exercise had little effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
