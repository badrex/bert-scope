The critical resolved shear stress for twin nucleation and the mechanism of twin growth are discussed, along with dislocation reactions at twin boundaries, basal glide, and fracture in the twin. The differences between twinning in bulk crystals and dislocation-free whiskers and platelets are also examined.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
