They discovered that the oxidation of ethylene is closely dependent on the development of formaldehyde, which acts as an agent for degenerate branching. The addition of formaldehyde to the reaction mixture reduces or removes the induction period without affecting the maximum rate of the reaction. This work provides a better understanding of the oxidation process and its implications for the chemical industry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
