They find that the deformation results from the accommodation of strain caused by the transformation front and is influenced by the applied stress, the fractional volume change, and the flow stress of the weaker phase. The research is supported by experimental observations on various metals and crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metal Deformation"}
