The shifts between all even tin isotopes were measured interferometrically, along with some measurements for odd isotopes. The results were compared with previous work on other tin lines to obtain accurate values of the volume shift constant and calculate configuration mixing in the levels studied.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
