The authors found that the kinetics of the thermal decomposition of fully deuterated diethyl ether are different from those of the non-deuterated version. They also studied the specific heats of various solid and liquid materials, providing insights into their thermal properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
