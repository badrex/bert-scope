The authors develop a mathematical model to describe the forces acting on fluid interfaces and the resulting capillary phenomena. This work provides a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms of capillary action and has implications for various applications, such as microfluidics and materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
