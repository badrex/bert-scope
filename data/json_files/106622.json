The author, John Lyon, provides an accurate drawing and an explanatory letter, analyzing the cause of the sinking ground as being undermined by water through a stratum of loose marle, which forms channels over time. This phenomenon raises concerns about the stability of the coast and the potential for greater changes in the landscape.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
