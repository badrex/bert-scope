The LVCM assumes the population dynamics of the Lotka-Volterra model when interactions between species are shaped by a refinement of the cascade model. The study finds that there exists a phase transition in qualitative global asymptotic stability, meaning a sharp transition from a positive probability to a zero probability that the LVCM is qualitatively globally asymptotically stable. This finding has implications for understanding the stability of ecological communities and the effects of feeding relations on population dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
