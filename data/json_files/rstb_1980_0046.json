Penicillin binds to the enzyme's active site, inhibiting its activity and preventing the formation of cross-linkages in the bacterial cell wall. The article explores the different types of PSEs, their reactions, and the mechanisms of penicillin action on these enzymes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
