By cutting or removing most of the tube, the telescope can be more easily managed and directed at stars. The author also provides solutions for potential issues, such as maintaining the position of the eyepiece and using a lantern to find the objective glass in the dark. This design aims to make telescopes more accessible and user-friendly for astronomers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
