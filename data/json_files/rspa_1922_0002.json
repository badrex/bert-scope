They used spectrographs to capture the spectrum of the night sky and found that the intensity of the aurora line did not seem to be connected with magnetic or solar disturbance. The author also observed that the green line was present on both clear and cloudy nights, suggesting that clouds may diffuse rather than absorb the light of the aurora line.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
