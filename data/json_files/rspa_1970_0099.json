They found that the reaction is a free radical chain process, producing carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, hydrogen, glyoxal, formaldehyde, and other products. The reaction rate is dependent on the square of the acetylene concentration and is mostly independent of oxygen concentration. The authors also investigated the effect of various additives on the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas-phase chemistry"}
