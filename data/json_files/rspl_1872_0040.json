The author proposes that the two-ranked alternate order is the simplest and most ancestral leaf arrangement, from which other spiral and whorled orders have evolved through various degrees of twist in the plant's axis. The article also highlights the importance of leaf arrangement in the bud for economy of space and protection, and presents experimental evidence to support the proposed evolutionary process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
