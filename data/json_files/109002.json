Norman Lockyer, conducted spectroscopic observations of the Sun and discovered new solar lines in the solar spectrum. These lines were found to be coincident with the Fraunhofer lines C and F, and were observed in solar prominences. The discovery of these new lines helped to understand the behavior of the solar spectrum and the nature of sunspots.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
