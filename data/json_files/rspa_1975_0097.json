The author introduces a simple coordinate-invariant system of simultaneous linear algebraic equations to calculate the Poisson bracket and its Fermi-Dirac counterpart. The new formalism is more efficient and has better properties of consistency, coordinate invariance, motion invariance, and gauge invariance compared to previous approaches.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
