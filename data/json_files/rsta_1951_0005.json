The authors calculate the stress distribution and strain around the hole using a mathematical theory and compare the results with experimental data from a vulcanized natural rubber compound. The findings can be applied to understanding the behavior of materials like rubber under stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
