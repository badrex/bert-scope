It examines the limitations of Newton's hypothesis and explores alternative methods by D'Alembert and Laplace. The author, Ivory, presents his own critique of Laplace's theorem and its demonstration, particularly when the exponent of the law of attraction is negative.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analytical Geometry"}
