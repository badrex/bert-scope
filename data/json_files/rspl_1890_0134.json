T. Parker and Mr. A. Reischek, conducted a study on the breeding and habitat of Sphenodon, also known as tuatara, in the island of Karewa, New Zealand. They observed the tuatara's living conditions and the challenges of accessing the island due to its rocky terrain and ocean swell. The study aimed to provide insights into the tuatara's breeding patterns and their relationship with other sea-birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Herpetology"}
