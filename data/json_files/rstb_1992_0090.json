This dating technique has also confirmed palaeoenvironmental indications that the Mousterian industry in Europe was present somewhat earlier than the 100 ka limit previously accepted. Burnt flint and unburnt sediment have been important materials in Palaeolithic dating, with unburnt sediment offering a vast extension of luminescence dating on Palaeolithic sites.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Archaeology"}
