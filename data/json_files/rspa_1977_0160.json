The authors study the emergence and flight of supersonic liquid jets, examining the effects of decompression, drag, and Taylor instability. They also explore the formation of a spray shroud around the jet core and the role of converging nozzles in constraining the front of the liquid packet. The research provides a comprehensive understanding of the jet's history from initial decompression to the breakup of liquid slugs.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
