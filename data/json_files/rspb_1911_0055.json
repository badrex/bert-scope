They found that the eye can distinguish smaller differences in wavelength when dealing with continuous variations in hue, such as in a spectrum, compared to when dealing with monochromatic patches of light. The study also showed that the presence of white light does not affect the eye's sensitivity to changes in hue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision Science"}
