Joseph Braun. The author describes the process of freezing mercury using frigorific mixtures and natural cold, and the properties of solid mercury, such as its metallic form and hardness. The article also highlights the importance of accident in scientific discoveries and the role of experimentation in understanding the behavior of materials like mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metal Science"}
