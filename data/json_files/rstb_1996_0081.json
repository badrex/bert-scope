The research demonstrates that vole populations in the northwestern coastal region exhibit seasonal population dynamics, while those in the more mountainous northeastern and central regions exhibit multiannual cycles with a period of 3.5-4 years. The findings are related to other studies from Hokkaido and North European microtines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
