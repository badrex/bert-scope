He finds that both objects are much smaller than previously thought, with Ceres being about 16.6 miles in diameter and Pallas being around 10.1 miles in diameter. This discovery challenges the idea that these objects may have satellites due to their small size and mass.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
