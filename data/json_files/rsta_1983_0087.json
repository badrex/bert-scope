It explores the convergence of these couplings to a single \"grand unified\" coupling at higher energies and the uncertainties in calculating the proton lifetime in minimal theories. The article also touches upon the concept of energy-dependent couplings and their implications for grand unification and the role of lattice QCD in calculating these constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
