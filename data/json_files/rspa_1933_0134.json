They propose hypotheses about the energy differences between nuclei and the maximum energy of ejected particles in beta decay. The study provides evidence for the significance of the upper limit of beta-ray spectra and its relation to energy conservation in nuclear transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
