The author provides a detailed explanation of the finite element procedure, its advantages, and its applications in various fields, including frame structures, plate, shell, and solid elements. The article also highlights the challenges and solutions in calculating stress and strain using these methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
