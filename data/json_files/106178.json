Lorimer, invented a new dipping-needle called the \"Universal Magnetic Needle\" or \"Observation Compass\" to accurately measure the dip and amplitude for sea observations. The instrument is designed to be more precise and stable than previous models, allowing for better navigation and understanding of Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
