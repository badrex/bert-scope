This reaction is caused by the presence of a specific antibody and can lead to serious symptoms like muscle contractions and poisoning of blood vessels. The author discusses the biological significance of anaphylaxis and its relationship to immunity, as well as the potential for further research to improve our understanding of this complex reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
