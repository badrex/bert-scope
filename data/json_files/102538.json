The process involves dissolving the feather in aqua regia, drying it, and repeating until all the liquid is absorbed. The feather is then burned to create a tinder, which is used to rub the gold onto the silver surface. This method is known to only a few goldsmiths in Germany.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
