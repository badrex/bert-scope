They found that reduced reaction rates lead to the formation of a ZND detonation behind the precursor shock. The study confirms and expands upon previous interpretations of direct ZND-wave initiation and provides insights into the processes occurring during the transition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
