They discovered that the spleen is not the channel for these fluids, and the fluids are instead deposited in the spleen, gall bladder, and urinary bladder in a similar manner. The experiments also provided insights into the functions of the spleen in the animal economy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Circulatory system"}
