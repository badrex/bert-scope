The authors introduce the concept of defect energy, which is related to Griffith's specific surface energy of a crack. They derive global balance laws in the framework of distribution theory and show that only the energy balance is modified when moving cracks, cavities, or dislocations are present. The additional term represents the rate of energy released during the motion of the defect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
