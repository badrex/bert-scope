Marsden's research focused on the behavior of alpha particles and their scattering, which led to the discovery of the nuclear structure of atoms. This work had a significant impact on the field of nuclear physics and modern physics as a whole.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
