They suggest that nerve terminals compete for trophic molecules made available by muscle cells, and terminals with insufficient resources for growth are eliminated. This process occurs during both the development and reinnervation of muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
