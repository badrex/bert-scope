They found that the lignite was highest Oligocene or lowest Miocene, contrary to recent text-books and maps. The study also revealed a considerable number of species, mainly identical to well-known plants of the lignite of the Wetterau, which is generally classed as Upper Oligocene.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
