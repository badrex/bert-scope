They discuss the mechanism, forces, and moments involved in the process, and explore the advantages and limitations of using different methods, such as Mansfield's upper bound, to estimate collapse loads. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of plates under various loading conditions and contributes to the development of more accurate and efficient design methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
