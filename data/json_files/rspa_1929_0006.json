They found that the central carbon atom in the molecule has a four-fold alternating axis, which is in line with chemical and physical considerations. The molecule has a tetragonal bipyramidal class symmetry, and the crystal structure consists of two molecules per unit cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
