The crystals are harder and more resistant than common carbonate of lime, and they exhibit various forms and structures. The author also discusses the matrix of this substance, which is a brown oxide of iron mixed with argill and calcareous particles. This new species of carbonate of lime is found in Carinthia, Transylvania, and Scotland.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
