This technique involves joining a piece of the root of a fruit tree with a graft from another tree, allowing the sap to connect and promote growth. This method can be used to grow various fruit trees, including apples, pears, plums, cherries, apricots, and peaches. The author has successfully tested this method and encourages others to visit Totnam High-Cross to see the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture"}
