They discover that chromosome movement and pairing are influenced by factors such as chromosome size, localization, and chiasma distribution. The author also explains how these factors affect the variability in meiosis and the potential for structural hybrids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
