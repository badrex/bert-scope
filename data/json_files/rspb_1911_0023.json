The study finds that the substitution of the ethyl grouping in stovaine with other groupings produces a decrease in the rate of action, and that these compounds have similar and approximately equal effects on the circulation and respiration, with amyl stovaine being more potent as a local anesthetic.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Pharmacology"}
