They discuss the effects of methyl group substitution on the ionization and hydration of these compounds, and how it influences their acidic and basic constants. The study also compares the behavior of different types of amino-acids and their derivatives, providing insights into their chemical properties and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
