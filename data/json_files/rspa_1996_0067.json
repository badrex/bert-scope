The authors describe a computational method for analyzing three-dimensional rotary boundary layers and discuss different scenarios, including large gaps, small gaps, and multiple blades. They also explore new phenomena like inner-outer flow interactions and a doubly viscous structure induced by dense blade-gap arrangements.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
