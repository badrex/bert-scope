The authors conclude that the air in sewers is generally better ventilated and less polluted than previously thought, with most microorganisms coming from outside sources. They also emphasize the importance of proper sewer design to prevent the spread of microorganisms and suggest that sewer air may not have as many negative health effects as previously believed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Air Quality and Pollution"}
