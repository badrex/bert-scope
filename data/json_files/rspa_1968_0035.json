The theory focuses on slowly varying wavetrains, with oscillations locally in one of the normal modes of a waveguide. The governing equations are derived from a variational principle, and the article demonstrates how to construct higher-order approximations and integrate them by quadrature.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
