It explores their definitions, classifications, and the factors that influence their growth. The article also examines the adaptations in proteins and lipids that enable these microorganisms to survive in cold environments, as well as the effects of temperature on their growth rates and metabolic activities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
