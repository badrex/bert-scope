The authors review recent efforts to apply DLNs to animal life histories, focusing on patterns in growth, mortality, and maturation. They propose a new DLN and use it to analyze birds and mammals, demonstrating how evolutionary life history theory can be used to explain these patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
