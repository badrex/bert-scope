They investigated the nature of sunspots, their position, and the surrounding solar atmosphere. Their findings suggest that sunspots are phenomena occurring below the sun's photosphere and that the sun's heat may come from outside sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Solar Physics"}
