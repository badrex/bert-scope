The authors conducted experiments on various metals, including German silver, mild steel, brass, copper, and soft iron. They found that the Young's modulus and rigidity modulus of the metals decreased with increasing temperature. The study also provided interesting insights into the rate of decay of torsional oscillations at different temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
