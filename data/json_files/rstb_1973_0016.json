They found that isoproterenol caused membrane hyperpolarization and increased tissue cyclic AMP levels, leading to relaxation. The study also suggested that a calcium-dependent electrogenic pump, possibly activated by cyclic AMP, plays a role in adrenergically mediated relaxation in the myometrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Smooth Muscle Physiology"}
