They found that the reaction involves a chain mechanism with degenerate branching and that the initiation step is likely heterogeneous. The rate of the reaction is influenced by surface conditions, oxygen and cyclopropane partial pressures, and the addition of other gases like nitrogen and hydrogen. The results challenge the differentiation between the kinetics of hydrocarbon oxidation in the 'high' and 'low' temperature ranges.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
