By grafting quail cells into chick embryos or vice versa, researchers can track cell migrations and interactions during embryogenesis. The author presents findings on neural crest development, immune system development, and the role of neural crest cells in head morphogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
