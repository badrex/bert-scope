The researchers found that the crystals exhibit strong dichroism between the absorption edges and that the birefringence changes from positive to negative near the absorption edge. These findings provide valuable information on the electron energy levels in the solid and can help improve the understanding of the material's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
