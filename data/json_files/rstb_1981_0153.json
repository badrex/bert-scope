The authors categorize developmental strategies into three broad categories based on whether cell position influences or is influenced by cell fate. They explore the role of cell adhesion in tissue movements and the specification of patterns of cell association, providing evidence from their experiments on salamander pronephric duct morphogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
