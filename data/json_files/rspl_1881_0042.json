They observed the reversal of various spectral lines for each metal and provided a list of the reversed lines for each element. This research contributes to the understanding of the behaviour of metallic vapours in the electric arc and their spectroscopic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
