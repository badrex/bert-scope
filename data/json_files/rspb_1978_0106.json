It found that the diameter distributions of collagen fibrils in tendons and ligaments change with age, with a unimodal distribution at birth and a bimodal distribution at maturity. The study also observed that the development of elastic fibres does not parallel the development of collagen fibrils, and that diseased tissues have only immature elastic fibres.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
