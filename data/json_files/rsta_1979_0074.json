They found that these techniques can differentiate between equivalent and non-equivalent sites occupied by elements in the crystal, providing valuable structural information. The study also revealed that the cleavage of minerals like muscovite, lepidolite, phlogopite, and vermiculite exposes regions with varying compositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
