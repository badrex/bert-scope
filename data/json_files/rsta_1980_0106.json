The author examines various studies and theories on the topic, focusing on the role of elements such as phosphorus, tin, and antimony. The article also explores the mechanisms of surface segregation and its impact on cavity formation and material properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Creep and Embrittlement"}
