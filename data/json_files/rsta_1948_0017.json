The friction machine subjects the explosive to grazing friction from a swinging pendulum, enabling the study of the effects of varying velocities and pressures on the sensitiveness of initiators. This research is important for understanding and improving the safety of explosives and their handling in various industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
