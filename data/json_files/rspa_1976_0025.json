The technique utilizes spherical harmonics as a basis for rotationally invariant systems and converts tensor equations into an equivalent matrix form, enabling the analysis of geophysical problems with spherical or almost spherical boundary conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
