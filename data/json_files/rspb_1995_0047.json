Researchers found a single, highly polymorphic locus called the tunicate fusibility/histocompatibility (Fu/HC) haplotype, which controls colony specificity. The Fu/HC locus has up to 100 alleles in different natural populations, and the unprecedented polymorphism is maintained through overdominant selection. This discovery has implications for understanding the genetic basis of colony fusion and rejection in urochordates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
