The research finds that each species has unique adaptations for their specific habitat and foraging behavior, such as wing span, leg length, and tail length. These adaptations help the birds efficiently navigate their environment and select suitable feeding stations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
