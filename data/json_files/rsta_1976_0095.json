The authors examine the effects of landslides, cambering, and valley-bulging on slope stability and discuss the role of climate and geological processes in shaping these landscapes. They also provide insights into the stratigraphy and geotechnical properties of the area's Jurassic deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
