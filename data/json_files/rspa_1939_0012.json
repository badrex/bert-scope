The author demonstrates a method of successive approximations using the concept of relaxation to find the position of equilibrium in elastic frameworks. The theory is applicable to both discrete and continuous systems and provides a foundation for solving non-homogeneous linear integral and differential equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear algebra"}
