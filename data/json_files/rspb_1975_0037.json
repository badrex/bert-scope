Using electron microscopy on dry whole mounts, the researchers describe the external morphology and lorica construction of these collared flagellates. The findings contribute to the understanding of Arctic nanoplankton and the ecology and geographical distributions of these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
