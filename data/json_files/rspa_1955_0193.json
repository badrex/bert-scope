This process is distinct from crosslinking, which involves side-chain fractures. The authors provide a mathematical analysis of the conditions under which endlinking can form a network structure or gel, and discuss its implications for understanding the behavior of irradiated polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
