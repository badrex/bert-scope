They discuss aspects of the dentition, jaw mechanism, and braincase, and propose a reconstruction of the brain. The study concludes that gorgonopsids had a distinct functional organization compared to the Therocephalia and were likely derived separately from sphenocondont pelycosaurs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
