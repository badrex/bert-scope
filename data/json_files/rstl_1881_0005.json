Hopkinson, investigates the electrostatic capacity of glass and liquids, focusing on the discrepancies between his previous findings and those of other researchers. He concludes that his earlier results are accurate and that the differences can be attributed to defects in the methods used by others. The author also examines the capacity of a guard-ring condenser and discusses the influence of electromotive force on specific inductive capacity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
