The insects were preserved in an organic layer within the Middle Sands, and the author identified most of the remains as modern species. By analyzing the environmental requirements of the fauna, they concluded that the climate was cold but not extremely severe, similar to today's Finland between latitudes 60\u00b0 and 64\u00b0.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
