The authors explain how stresses and deformations in junctions are determined during steady sliding and how the coefficient of friction is related to the average life cycle of a single junction. Plasticine model experiments are used to study the behavior of junctions and provide insights into the frictional forces at play.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
