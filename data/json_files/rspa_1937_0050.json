The authors found that caesium films have greater stability and lower resistivity compared to rubidium films, while potassium films are the least stable. The results are consistent with the theory of thin film conductivity, and the decay of conductivity in these films is attributed to the widening of cracks and imperfections under surface tension forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
