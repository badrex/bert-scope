They found that the particles have a flat, wedge-shaped structure with DNA wound into a superhelix around a histone octamer. The study provides insights into the arrangement of DNA and histone proteins in the nucleosome core, which is essential for understanding gene regulation and DNA packaging in cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
