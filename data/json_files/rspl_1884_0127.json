They discovered that each body segment has four pairs of nephridia, one pair corresponding to each seta. This finding challenges the previous belief that only a single pair of nephridia exists in each segment of segmented worms. The author also discusses the relationship between nephridia and genital ducts in earthworms, suggesting that there may be two series of nephridia in each segment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Annelida Morphology"}
