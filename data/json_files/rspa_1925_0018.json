They introduce the concept of adiabatic invariants and suggest that half-integral orbits can be adopted to explain the Stark effect. The study also provides a further example of applying these conditions to a harmonic oscillator, resulting in consistent outcomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
