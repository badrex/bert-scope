Wilson, conducted experiments to investigate the electric effect of rotating a dielectric in a magnetic field. The results confirmed the predictions of the electromagnetic theory by Lorentz and Larmor, demonstrating the existence of an electromotive force in the dielectric. This study contributed to the understanding of the interaction between dielectrics and magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
