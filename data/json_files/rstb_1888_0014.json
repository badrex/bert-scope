They find that the two persistent carpals in the bird's wing, the intermedio-radiale and centralo-ulnare, are compound structures containing remnants of other bones. The study also traces the development of the three metacarpal bones and the distal phalanges, providing insights into the wing's structure and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Ornithology"}
