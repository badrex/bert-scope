They explain the 'chemical pseudopotential' scheme and the effective 'Huckel' type hamiltonian for energy levels. The author also highlights the non-Fermi liquid character of the two-dimensional Hubbard model and the role of pseudopotentials in determining particle-particle interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
