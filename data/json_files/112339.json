They propose a theory that explains how the molecules in the ice can rearrange themselves to form continuous masses. The author also touches upon the temperature of glaciers, the sliding of glaciers on their beds, and the role of polar expeditions in studying these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
