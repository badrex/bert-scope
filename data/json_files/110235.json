He conducted experiments and devised a method to correct this error, which involved using a piano-wire to detect surface irregularities and constructing a scale to minimize the error. This method could be applied to various useful purposes when a straight edge was required.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metrology"}
