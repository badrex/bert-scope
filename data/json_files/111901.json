The resulting crystalline mass has unique solubility properties and a complex molecular structure. The author also discusses the formation of other compounds, such as the dichloride and platinum-salt, and compares the stability of this pyridine derivative to other ethylated bases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
