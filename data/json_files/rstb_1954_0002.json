The authors collected over 700 samples and provide descriptions and illustrations of all recorded British species. They discuss the fungi's habitat, nutrition, and the role of mycorrhizal associations with tree roots. The research also explores the conditions that favor the development of fruiting bodies and the potential for further study in this area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
