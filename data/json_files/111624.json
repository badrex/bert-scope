When blood is mixed with sherry wine, the corpuscles change appearance and emit tails or filaments. These changes suggest that the wine alters the properties of the fluid in which the corpuscles swim, causing them to discharge molecular particles and emit tails. This research provides insight into the relationship between wine and blood components, as well as the behavior of blood corpuscles under certain conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
