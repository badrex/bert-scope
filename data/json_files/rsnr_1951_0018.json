It highlights his admiration for Isaac Newton and his contributions to the introduction of Newton's ideas to France. Voltaire and his mistress, the Marquise du Chatelet, made significant experimental contributions to natural knowledge, demonstrating the untenability of the view that fire particles had weight. Despite their work, the judges of the competition did not consider their works worthy of a prize.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
