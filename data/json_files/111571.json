W. Hofmann and Dr. George Merck discovered a new volatile organic acid, sorbic acid, from the berries of the mountain ash. They found that it has remarkable properties and can be converted into a crystalline acid. The discovery of sorbic acid led to the study of isomerism and the establishment of a new series of organic acids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
