The authors study the heat of adsorption and its relation to the kinetics of the hydrogen-deuterium reaction to better understand the reaction mechanism. They find that the adsorption behavior and reaction rates differ between the two metals, which they attribute to differences in their crystal structures. The results provide insights into the nature of the repulsive forces between adsorbed hydrogen atoms and the role of empty sites in catalysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
