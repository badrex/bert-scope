They found that the flame's spectrum is similar to that of ammonia burning in oxygen, with distinct bands attributed to water vapor, ammonia, and nitrogen oxides. The study provides valuable insights into the chemistry and combustion processes of these gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
