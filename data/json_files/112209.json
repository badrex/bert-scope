He found that the proportions of various elements in the ocean remain nearly constant far from the shores. The constant proportions depend on the large quantity of salts in the ocean and the uniform action of the numerous organic beings inhabiting the ocean. The author also discovered that the equatorial regions contain the highest percentage of saline matter, and that the North Atlantic Ocean contains more salt than the South Atlantic due to the influence of the Gulf Stream.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
