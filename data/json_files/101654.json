He explains that swim bladders help fish maintain buoyancy and that there is a variety of structures and shapes in different fish species. Ray also mentions the absence of swim bladders in flat and cartilaginous fish and the role of swim bladders in eels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ichthyology"}
