They describe the structure of the organ, including the vestibular sac, hair-like processes, and the presence of siliceous sand particles. The author also discusses the similarities and differences in the organ's form across different crustacean species and suggests that this delicate and uniform structure may be present throughout the class Crustacea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
