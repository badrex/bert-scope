They found that the probability of a radical being trapped increases with the reaction rate, but the fraction of total radicals that become trapped remains constant at about 1%. The authors studied the behavior of radicals under different degrees of occlusion by modifying the polymer's swelling with solvents or second monomers. This allowed them to observe a thermal after-effect for the first time and provided insights into the potential use of trapped radicals as initiators for other free radical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
