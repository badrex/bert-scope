They discuss the lithologic and stratigraphic evidence from the drilling site and regional seismic reflection data, placing it in the context of the early tectonic evolution of the North Atlantic Ocean. The study reveals the morphology of the western Iberian continental margin and the initial creation of the interior basin filled with pre-Neocomian sediments, related to the Permo-Triassic-Liassic and/or late Jurassic to early Cretaceous distensive episodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
