The authors conducted experiments using a gas-filled chamber and observed that the absorption of X-rays is influenced by the atomic number of the target element. This work contributed to the understanding of atomic structure and the development of quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
