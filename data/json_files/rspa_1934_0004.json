They found that the strength of metals depends on the amount of work that remains latent in them. The proportion of latent energy in the metal remains nearly constant during successive stages of deformation, and the maximum possible latent energy a metal can retain is around 14 calories per gram at room temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
