The authors discuss the experimental setup, data analysis, and phase shift solutions for different energy ranges. The results provide insights into the behavior of phase shifts and partial amplitudes, confirming the existence of strong effects in nucleon excited states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear and Particle Physics"}
