The authors focus on pressure and velocity distributions in the explosion products and solve the hydrodynamical equations numerically using the method of characteristics. The study simplifies the problem by treating the charge and gas and fluid fields as two-dimensional. The findings show that the shock wave is straight, and the initial conditions in the medium are uniform.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
