The authors focus on two topics closely related to geodetic research: editing and archiving of Doppler data and generating accurate satellite orbit parameters and ephemerides. They describe the methods used to analyze the data, including the editing process and the generation of accurate satellite trajectories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Satellite Navigation"}
