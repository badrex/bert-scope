The authors investigate the slow step in the pathway to dissociation products and construct potential energy profiles for reaction. They find that a general cause of the release of a range of kinetic energies in a unimolecular reaction is a rate-determining isomerization, followed by a more energetically facile dissociation with excess energy in the transition state for dissociation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
