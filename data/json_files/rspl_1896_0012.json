The fat is deposited in the placenta from the maternal blood and is used by the fetus for its nutrition. This finding helps to explain the source of fat for the fetus and sheds light on the process of fetal nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Reproduction and Development"}
