They discover that both animals use a combination of specialized feet and vacua to create adhesion, with the Gecko's feet having unique cavities and the fly's feet having concave surfaces. This research provides insight into the evolutionary adaptations of these animals and their ability to navigate diverse environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
