It emphasizes the importance of using approximation methods for hyperdiverse groups, such as insects, arthropods, nematodes, fungi, and microorganisms, to gain a better understanding of their richness and taxonomic diversity. The article also highlights the need for further research on correlations between well-known and hyperdiverse groups to improve conservation and sustainable use of worldwide biodiversity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
