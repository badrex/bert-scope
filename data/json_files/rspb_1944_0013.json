They found that these symbionts supply vitamins of the B group, which are essential for the growth and development of the insects. The study also demonstrated that the requirements of B-group vitamins differ between insects with and without intracellular symbionts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
