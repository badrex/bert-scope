They describe the properties of these holms and their applications in interfacial tension determination, stability criteria for floating objects, and wetting of solids by fluid sheets. The authors also discuss the behavior of holms meeting rods and spheres, and the detachment of rods from the interface. They provide numerical solutions for meridian curves and tabulate characteristic quantities for different cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
