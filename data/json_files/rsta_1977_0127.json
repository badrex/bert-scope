It presents the classification of iron meteorites based on chemical composition, including nickel and phosphorus content and trace elements. The author also proposes a 'fingerprint' for iron meteorites, combining structural specifications and bulk chemical analysis for better classification and understanding of these celestial objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
