The authors explain how these proteins damage membranes by forming transmembrane pores and describe the self-association and amphiphilic transition of the proteins. They also compare the C5b-9(m) complex to other channel-forming proteins, such as Staphylococcus aureus a-toxin and streptolysin-O.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
