The authors find that the Arrhenius equation does not apply to these reactions, and they propose a more complex mechanism of activation. The results provide insights into the decomposition of carboxylic acids and their reaction mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
