They discovered that the electrical state of nerve fibers changes when excited, and they used this to study the connections between the cortex and the spinal cord. Their findings provided insights into the physiology of the spinal cord and its relation to higher centers and peripheral nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
