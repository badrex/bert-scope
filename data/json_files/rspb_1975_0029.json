The molecule has a chair form glucopyranose ring and its structure is close to other sugars. The packing of the molecules is determined by a complete scheme of hydrogen bonding, forming an infinite nitrophenyl-N-acetylglucosaminide/water/nitrophenyl-acetylglucosaminide'sandwich' in the crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
