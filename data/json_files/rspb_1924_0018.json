They discovered that the addition of formates greatly increased the activity of bacterial fermentation and revealed latent fermenting powers in bacteria. The results showed that bacteria can ferment substances with two, three, four, and six carbon atoms, and the presence of formates allowed for a more efficient decomposition of carbohydrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
