The authors extend the theory of air drag on satellite orbits to derive the air-density profile from the motion of the orbit's perigee. They analyze data from the Explorer III and Sputnik II satellites to determine the scale height of the atmosphere in different altitude regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
