They found that despite differences in shell form, the two genera share similarities in their orientation, adductor muscles, and mantle structure. The study also revealed unique features of the nervous system in Spondylus, which sets it apart from other Lamellibranchs. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the evolution and relationships between these two genera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
