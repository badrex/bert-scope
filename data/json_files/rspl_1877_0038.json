He used a whistle mounted on Wolf's bottle and a siphon manometer to measure the pressure. The results showed that a sound with an amplitude of only one hundred-millionth of a centimeter could still be heard on a still night. This study helped in understanding the limits of audible sound and the factors affecting sound propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
