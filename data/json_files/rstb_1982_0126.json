The authors present evidence for different types of structural interactions between cytoskeletal filaments and their relative contributions to the formation and consolidation of various cellular domains. They also explore a unique example of a coordinated interaction linking cell membrane events, the contractile machinery, and the microtubule system in polymorphonuclear leucocytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
