They find that the high specific gravity of the sandstone is due to the presence of a large proportion of highly crystalline barium sulfate, which acts as a binding or cementing material for the sand grains. The author explores possible mechanisms for the deposition of barium sulfate and suggests that it may be due to local geological conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
