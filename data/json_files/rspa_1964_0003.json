They derive equations for the properties of normal and oblique shock waves and demonstrate that the equation of state for an ultra-relativistic gas makes the problem determinate. The study focuses on an ultra-relativistic gas, such as pure radiation, and avoids questions of relativistic thermodynamics and statistical mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
