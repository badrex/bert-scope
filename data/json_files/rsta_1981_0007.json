It discusses the behavior of sharp cracks in ductile metals under load and the mechanisms and laws controlling crack advance by these processes. The article also comments on creep-fatigue and corrosion-fatigue crack growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
