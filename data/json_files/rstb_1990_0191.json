It explores various mathematical models that demonstrate how spatial aspects can alter population and community dynamics. The author emphasizes the importance of considering spatial effects in population studies and suggests that further research is needed to better understand the role of spatial subdivision and dispersal in natural systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
