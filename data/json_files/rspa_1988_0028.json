The authors provide a theoretical explanation for the origin of this absorption and present experimental results that confirm the dependence on frequency, magnetic field, and temperature. The study involves the use of longitudinal acoustic waves propagated along the crystal's principal directions and magnetic fields up to 4 Tesla. The non-resonant absorption is associated with the non-Kramers doublet at about 21 K and is explained through spin-lattice relaxation processes involving two phonon operators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
