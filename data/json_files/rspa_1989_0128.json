They used numerical bifurcation theory to analyze the steady-state Navier-Stokes equations and found that the Schaeffer's conclusions about the infinite model are accurate only for large values of the radius ratio. For smaller values, the state diagram becomes more complicated, and the transition process modeled by the homotopy depends on the radius ratio.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
