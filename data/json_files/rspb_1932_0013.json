They found that stimulation of the cervical vagosympathetic nerves, cervical vagi, stellate ganglia, and thoracic vagosympathetic nerves caused pulmonary vasoconstriction, vasodilation, and changes in bronchial tubes. The results confirmed the functional activity of the pulmonary vasomotor nerves and their role in regulating pulmonary blood flow and arterial pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
