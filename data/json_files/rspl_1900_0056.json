They discuss the atomic packing and arrangement in diamond and graphite, two forms of carbon. Diamond has the closest possible atomic packing, while graphite has a more open arrangement. The author also explores the relationship between crystal structure and properties such as hardness and cleavage.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
