They found that the maximum pressure of bile secretion varies among different animals and that the pressure at which bile secretion is balanced by absorption is not an absolute measurement of liver cell force. The study provides insights into the physiology of the liver and bile ducts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
