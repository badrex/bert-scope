The authors introduce the admittance variable to simplify the equations and improve the accuracy of calculations. They also extend the reciprocity theorem to relate reflexion coefficients for propagation in planes symmetrically disposed about a plane at right angles to the magnetic meridian. The new method is applied to various ionosphere models and compared with previous methods, showing good agreement between results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
