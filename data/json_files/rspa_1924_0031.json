They improved the experimental methods, extended the observations, and investigated the effects of various gases on the electron emission from a liquid alloy of sodium and potassium. The results showed that a steady electron emission can be achieved by introducing a large mass of gas into the apparatus, which led to consistent observations and a better understanding of the phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
