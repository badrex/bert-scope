They used a continuous method of calorimetry to measure the heat capacity of water at different temperatures and compared their results with previous studies. The findings showed a close agreement with other measurements, indicating that the values for electrical units were close to the true values. The study also discussed the importance of the 15\u00b0C calorie value and its relation to other measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
