He used the clock's pendulum to measure the time per sidereal day and compared the effect of gravity on the clock's going at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope. The observations helped determine the difference in the clock's performance due to the difference in locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
