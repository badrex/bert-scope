The authors explore the possible lines of development of centric morphology, including the origin and development of areolae, occluding plates, rimoportulae, fultoportulae, ocelli, and pseudocelli. They also evaluate evidence from ecology and fossil studies to help understand the evolution of centric diatoms and the concept of \"punctuated equilibria.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
