Bateson challenged the gradualism of Darwin's theory of evolution and introduced the concept of \"discontinuous variation.\" He was a key figure in the acceptance of Gregor Mendel's work on genetics and played a crucial role in establishing the John Innes Institution as a leading center for genetic research. His work on genetics, including the study of linkage and segregation, has had a lasting impact on the field."}
