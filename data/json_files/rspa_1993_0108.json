The model considers the flow induced by the hot flame as a variable-density boundary-layer flow, with transport properties assumed to be proportional to the temperature. The main features of the calculated flame-sheet shape are in agreement with observations of an ordinary domestic candle flame.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
