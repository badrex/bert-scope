He discovers that electricity is only produced when water is present and concludes that it is due to the friction of water globules against the sides of the opening or against the substances opposed to its passage. The author also explores the effects of pressure, heat, and the nature of the fluid in motion on the evolution of electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
