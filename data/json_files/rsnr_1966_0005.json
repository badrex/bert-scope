The author provides a detailed account of Newton's library, which was largely forgotten and neglected until its eventual preservation at Trinity College, Cambridge. The article highlights the scarcity of imaginative literature in Newton's collection, the prominence of theological and alchemical works, and the surprising lack of books by major scientific figures of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Book history and Library studies"}
