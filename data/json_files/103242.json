The stranded individuals were helped by a local Guivamois, who swam to their vessels and guided them to safety. The Jesuits also described the culture, language, and way of life of the inhabitants of these islands, including their survival techniques at sea and their interactions with the local population.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Anthropology"}
