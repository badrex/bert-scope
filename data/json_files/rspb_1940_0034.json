They found that cochlear degeneration occurs after birth and is associated with changes in the electrical reactions. The study compared the cochlear changes in shaker-1 mice with those in normal mice and provided insights into the genetic mechanisms behind hearing loss in these animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
