They explore the effects of certain plant diseases on stem elongation and the potential involvement of hormones like auxins, gibberellins, and inhibitors. The author also highlights the discovery of gibberellins from studying plant diseases and emphasizes the importance of further research on plant hormones in extreme habitats and diseased plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology", "sub_discipline": "Plant Pathology"}
