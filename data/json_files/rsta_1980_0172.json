It explains how external forces, such as collisions between clouds and gravitational effects, can trigger star formation and influence the efficiency of the process. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the early evolution of galaxies and the connection between star formation and spiral structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Galaxy formation and evolution"}
