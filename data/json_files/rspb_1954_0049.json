It explains the need for maintaining the oxygen saturation of the blood and controlling the partial pressure of oxygen in the lungs. The author outlines the different components of oxygen systems, such as the gas store, regulator, and mask, and emphasizes the importance of considering physiological factors in their design. The article also addresses issues related to mask leakage, emergency situations, and the need for lightweight equipment in mountaineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
