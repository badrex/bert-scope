It shows that calcium is necessary for yeast flocculation and that the more flocculent variants can replace the less flocculent ones when grown in a copper medium containing calcium. The research also demonstrates that calcium protects yeast cells from copper and that the less flocculent cells develop more resistance to copper during growth in a calcium-free medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
