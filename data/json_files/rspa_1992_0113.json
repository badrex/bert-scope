They find that the Langmuir isotherm predicts fewer shocks than the non-ideal isotherm, and that the number of shocks and states depends on the type of isotherm used in the model. This has implications for the column length required to achieve complete separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
