They propose a new definition for a catalyst and argue that enzymes determine chemical changes rather than merely accelerating them. The authors also emphasize the importance of electrolytes in enzyme action and the complexity of interactions in solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
