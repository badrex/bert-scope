Trinidad", "semantic_tags": ["Population Genetics", "Genetic Drift", "Founder Effect", "Allozymic Analysis", "Guppy Species"], "tldr": "This study examines the genetic consequences of introducing guppies (Poecilia reticulata) in N. Trinidad. The introduced population has significantly impacted the native guppy population, with genetic evidence suggesting a founder event and genetic drift. The introduced guppies have spread downstream, replacing the native guppy population in a substantial stretch of the river. This research highlights the importance of understanding the genetic impact of species introductions on local populations and ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
