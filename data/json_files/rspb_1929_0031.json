They found that certain compounds, particularly those with a free basic group and an acylamino group, showed high trypanocidal activity. The most effective substances were from the styryl series, while the anil quinolines generally had low trypanocidal action but strong bactericidal properties. The study also highlighted the importance of acetylation in reducing toxicity and enhancing trypanocidal effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Medicinal Chemistry"}
