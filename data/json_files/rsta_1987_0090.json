It also explores the possibility that some comets in short-period orbits may degenerate into asteroids. The article covers the composition of cometary comas and tails, as observed by optical, infrared, ultraviolet, and radio sensors, and the role of the solar wind in forming cometary tails. The study of comets and their origin, along with space missions, is essential to answer basic questions about their nature and possible connection to asteroids.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comets"}
