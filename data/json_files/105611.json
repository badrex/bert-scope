He measured the diameter of Venus using an object-glass micrometer and a reflecting telescope. The observations were challenging due to clouds and the telescope's lack of equatorial motion. The mean diameter of Venus was found to be 58 seconds, and the diameter at the time of the transit was calculated to be 1 minute and 0.19 seconds.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
