The penguin fossils are believed to be from the late Eocene epoch, earlier than previously thought. The study examines two collections of fossil penguins from Seymour Island, one from a Swedish expedition in 1901-1903 and the other from a British expedition in 1946. The research provides insights into the ecology and distribution of these ancient penguins, suggesting they lived in warmer waters than present-day Antarctic coasts.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
