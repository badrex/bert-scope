It suggests that plants have a high number of inactive secondary compounds, which increases the probability of producing active compounds in the face of consumer adaptation. The author argues that plants with a high chemical diversity are better defended against potential threats, such as herbivores and pathogens, and that this diversification incurs costs but is advantageous for the plant's survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
