The research focuses on the secretion of albumen layers, egg coverings, egg capsules, and jelly layers using light and electron microscopy. The findings reveal the mechanisms involved in the production and release of secretions and the molding of the egg capsule within the capsule gland. The study also explores the programmed degeneration of the egg capsule, which is essential for hatching in this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Malacology"}
