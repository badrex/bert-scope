They suggest the presence of another, more abundant yellow pigment, which has yet to be isolated and fully understood. The author also discusses the limitations of previous methods for isolating the pigment and proposes a new approach to study it.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
