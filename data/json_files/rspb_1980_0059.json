They used electron microscopy and image processing techniques to study the molecular structure of these crystals. The crystals have a lattice structure with unit cell dimensions of 16 nm x 23 nm. The researchers considered the possibility of an immunological significance for these crystals and discussed their findings in detail.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Structural Biology"}
