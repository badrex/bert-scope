They found that the charges on negative ions in various gases are similar, and the motion of negative ions in dry gases follows different laws compared to positive ions. The study also shows that the velocity of agitation of negative ions is greater than that of particles in thermal equilibrium with the gas molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
