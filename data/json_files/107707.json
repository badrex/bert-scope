{"article_id": "107707", "revised_title": "On the Equilibrium of Homogeneous Fluid Masses in Rotation", "semantic_tags": ["Fluid mechanics", "Celestial mechanics", "Equilibrium", "Gravity", "Mathematical physics"], "tldr": "The author investigates the conditions necessary for the equilibrium of a fluid mass in rotation, focusing on the properties of attraction and the role of gravity. They discuss the concept of level strata and the importance of density differences in maintaining equilibrium. The author also explores the mathematical principles and equations involved in determining the equilibrium of a fluid mass on the surfaces of planets.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
