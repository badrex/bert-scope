The authors analyze the problem using the method of iteration and boundary layer equations, considering the effects of magnetic field and fluid dynamics. The study provides insights into the behavior of the flow and drag coefficient under varying magnetic and fluid conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
