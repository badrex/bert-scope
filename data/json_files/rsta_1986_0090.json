It focuses on the Great Meteor East study area in the Northeast Atlantic, examining the geological, geochemical, and geotechnical properties of the sediments. The authors outline the multiple barriers concept, which aims to restrict the transport of radionuclides back to humans, and explore the potential effectiveness of oceanic sediments in providing a barrier against the escape of long-lived radionuclides. The article also highlights the need for further research to understand the oceanic environment and assess the suitability of oceanic burial as a disposal option.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
