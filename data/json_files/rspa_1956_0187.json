They show that a negative coefficient of volume expansion may be expected if the Fermi energy of the electron gas changes rapidly with energy and is associated with a high electronic specific heat from a large number of overlapping bands. This discovery could lead to a better understanding of the behavior of metals and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
