It explores the different mechanisms, including diffusiophoresis, thermophoresis, and impaction, that contribute to the transfer of these pollutants to the ground. The article also highlights the importance of understanding these processes to estimate regional inputs of these compounds and their ecological effects on the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
