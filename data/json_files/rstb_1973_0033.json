They found a variety of specialized contacts at rod and cone pedicles, including ribbon junctions, distal junctions, and basal junctions. Horizontal cells make ribbon and distal junctions with photoreceptor cell pedicles, while bipolar cells make ribbon or basal junctions. The study also revealed patterns of neuronal organization at the outer synaptic layer, including contacts between second-order neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
