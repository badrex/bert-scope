The authors find that the two effects have different magnitudes and signs, leading them to conclude that the pole effect is not identical to the pure Stark effect. The study provides insights into the behavior of iron lines under varying electric fields and contributes to the understanding of atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
