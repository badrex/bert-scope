The changes in skull size and variability are most noticeable in measurements of skull breadth and parallel the changes observed in the monkeys' teeth. These findings suggest that the effects of geographic isolation may have led to these differences in skull morphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
