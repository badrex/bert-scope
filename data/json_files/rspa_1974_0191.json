The research focuses on determining the criteria for separating aeolian depositional and erosional features, understanding the aerodynamic flow field over craters, and identifying the important parameters governing particle movement by wind on Mars. The findings contribute to understanding the complex surface characteristics and geologic history of Mars.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
