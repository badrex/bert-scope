The research finds that stronger solute-water forces and weaker solute-membrane forces are associated with lower permeating power. Most substituents that form hydrogen bonds with water decrease permeation, while intramolecular hydrogen bonding accelerates it. Inductive effects, such as halogens and double/triple bonds, also impact permeability. The main factor in increased permeability with longer hydrocarbon chains is an entropy effect related to changes in local water structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Membrane Biology"}
