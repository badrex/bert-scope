The authors discovered that the curves for refrangibility lower than about 7000 \u00c5 are hyperbolas, and when near the limit of visibility, the hyperbolas approach a parabolic form. The results show that the radiation is not strictly proportional to the expended electrical energy, but increases gradually up to a certain point and then becomes constant.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
