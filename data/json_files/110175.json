He concluded that the height of the arch was approximately 100 miles, and the visible length was about 550 miles. This study helped to understand the nature of the Aurora Borealis and its relationship to Earth's magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
