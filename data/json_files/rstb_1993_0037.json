The study disproves a hypothesis suggesting that only a facilitatory mechanism can account for the response of a fly wide-field movement-detecting neuron (HI) to sequential stimulation of a pair of adjacent photoreceptors. The research shows that the responses of a directionally selective movement-detecting neural network architecture, based on lateral inhibitory interactions, match the recorded responses of the fly HI neuron, supporting an inhibitory interaction mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
