They found that injecting rats with the hormone caused changes in their behavior, body weight, and reproductive system, including the development of excessive body fat, atrophy of the thymus, and hyperplasia of the ovaries. These findings provide further insight into the effects of pituitary disorders on the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
