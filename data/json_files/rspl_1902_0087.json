They found that the influence of sun-spot frequency on the amplitude of the diurnal inequality is more significant in winter and during equinoxes, and less important for the vertical force. The study also revealed that the equinoxes have the most dependency on sun-spot frequency.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
