They found that metal salts of homopolymeric acids have high elastic moduli and do not soften significantly below their decomposition temperature. These materials have better structural properties than most organic polymers, making them promising candidates for future applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Polymers and Polyelectrolytes"}
