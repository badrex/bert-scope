It demonstrates that these waves exhibit critical layers, which play a crucial role in stabilizing the solar and interplanetary magnetic fields. The study also reveals that at these critical layers, wave energy and momentum fluxes undergo a jump discontinuity, and propagating waves communicate their energy and momentum to the interplanetary magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
