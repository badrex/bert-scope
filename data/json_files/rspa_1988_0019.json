The model is based on the Langmuir-Hinshelwood mechanism, where a pair of ordinary differential equations describe a heterogeneously catalyzed chemical reaction. The study focuses on the dynamics of the reaction, with emphasis on geometrical representation of the observed dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Bifurcation theory"}
