It explains the difference between reserves, resources, and potential resources and provides estimates of the tonnages available at different price categories. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the processes that led to the concentration of uranium and thorium in the Earth's crust and highlights the need for increased exploration and development of new search techniques to discover hidden ore-bodies. The article also examines the distribution of uranium in the Earth's crust, the primary and secondary uranium minerals, and the reserves of uranium in various countries.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Resource Assessment"}
