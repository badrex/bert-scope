The research explores the different stages of pupal development and how tsetse pupae can withstand adverse conditions. The findings show that tsetse pupae have a high resistance to desiccation, which allows them to complete development in low humidity environments. This resistance is due to a decrease in the permeability of the puparium and pupal skin, a reduction in the size of respiratory lobes, and an increase in the percentage of water loss that can be tolerated before development stops.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
