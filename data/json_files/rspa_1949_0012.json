The method generalizes the \"screw transformation\" to apply to various problems, such as the three-dimensional Ising model and order-disorder problems. The relation between the ferromagnetic and order-disorder problems is discussed, and it is shown that both can be derived from a single function of two variables.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
