The research determines the distribution of iron in various mineral phases and provides insights into the composition of lunar soils. The findings reveal differences in the iron distribution and mineral content between the two samples, offering valuable information for understanding the geological history of the Moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
