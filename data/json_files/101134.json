These stones were smooth, spherical, and had a shell-like outer layer that gave them their golden hue. They were found in the animals' bladders and were similar in appearance to seed pearls. The stones could be dissolved in strong acids but would lose their color when exposed to heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
