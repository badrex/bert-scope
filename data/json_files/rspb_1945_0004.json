They found a close correspondence between shape and orientation in both normal and mutant bristles, and suggested that bristle shape is influenced by factors related to the growth of chitin chains and the substances secreted by the trichogen cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
