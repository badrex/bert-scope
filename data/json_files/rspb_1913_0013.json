The authors found that the resilience of the arterial wall affects the conduction of the systolic wave and the blood pressure, as measured by a sphygmometer. The study also demonstrated that the nature of the arterial wall plays a significant role in the pulse curve, which has not been previously considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
