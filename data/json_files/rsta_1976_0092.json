The authors investigate the lithostratigraphic sequence, internal structure, and the effects of cambering and valley bulging on the Upper Lias formation. They also examine the topography, geological sequence, and the role of superficial structures in the development of the valley.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
