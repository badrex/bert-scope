Researchers found that starlings hatch and develop in a photorefractory state, and that juvenile photorefractoriness is not caused by long days. The findings suggest that birds develop in a photorefractory state and that 3 weeks of short days are insufficient to terminate this photorefractoriness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Avian Biology"}
