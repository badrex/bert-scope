They discovered that the vibrations are caused by the difference in temperature and the repulsive action of heat between the materials. This research led to the understanding of a new mechanical agency in heat, which has implications for the study of heat transfer and material science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
