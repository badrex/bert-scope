The researchers found that the EC50 for apparent steady-state activation of NR1a/NR2D receptors by glutamate was 450 nM, and extracellular Mg2+ produced a voltage-dependent block of glutamate responses with an IC50 of 440 \u00b5M at -70 mV. The study provides insights into the single-channel conductance and behavior of these receptors, which can help in understanding their role in the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
