He used new instruments, such as Sir Wm. Thomson's Reflecting Galvanometer and Mr. Latimer Clarke's Potentiometer, to study the electrical properties of living nerve and muscle. Radcliffe discovered that nerve and muscle tissues have a high resistance to the passage of a common voltaic current and that they contain both positive and negative electricity in equal amounts. He also investigated the electrical phenomena that occur when nerve and muscle pass from a state of rest to action, suggesting that a discharge of electricity, similar to that of the torpedo, takes place.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
