The authors measure four magnetic hyperfine constants for oxygen and three for fluorine, finding that the usually accepted theory fails to explain the results. The findings suggest that a three-term Hamiltonian is necessary to represent the magnetic interactions in these atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
