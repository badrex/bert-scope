They develop rate equations for the domain size distribution and find a self-similar solution, which they validate through simulations. This work contributes to understanding the behavior of coarsening processes and the relevance of self-similarity in domain growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
