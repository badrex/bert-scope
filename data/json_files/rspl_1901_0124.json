He used a vacuum tube and various techniques to eliminate mercury, which often contaminated the hydrogen samples. The experiments revealed that the purified hydrogen formed distinct blue and pink layers, or strata, when exposed to an electric current. This research contributed to the understanding of gas properties and the behavior of plasmas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
