They observe that these animals exhibit rhythmic movements of progression, resembling hopping or running, which are of interest in understanding the physiology of the nervous system. The authors also discover that the application of the drug \"novocain\" can change the narcosis movements from scratching to progression in guinea pigs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
