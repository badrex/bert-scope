Bate demonstrates that the changes in the crab's development are gradual and not a sudden transformation. He also explains how the appendages in the larvae become secondary parts of the same organs in the adult crab. Bate's research is supported by illustrations of various developmental stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
