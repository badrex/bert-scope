It explains how to calculate the conductance of stomata by measuring the total leaf resistance to gaseous flow and the mesophyll resistance. The author demonstrates the application of the theory on two pelargonium leaves, resulting in consistent findings and deduced rates of assimilation that align with observed rates in practice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
