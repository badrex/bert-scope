This condition causes the oysters to be green and can be dangerous for humans who consume them. The researchers found that the green color is due to an increase in the amount of copper present in the oyster's body, which is linked to the diseased condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
