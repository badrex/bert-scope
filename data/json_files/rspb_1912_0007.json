They found that these compounds were produced from simpler carbon compounds like glycerol, ethylene glycol, and malic acid. The authors also discovered that bacteria like B. lactis aerogenes and B. cloacae can produce these compounds. This research helps in understanding the metabolic pathways of bacteria and the decomposition of glucose.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
