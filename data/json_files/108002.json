They propose a new design for dipping needles that eliminates the need to invert the poles, making observations more accurate and efficient. This design also allows for measuring the terrestrial magnetic intensity alongside the dip, providing valuable information for various scientific expeditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geomagnetism"}
