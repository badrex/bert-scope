Turacin is a complex molecule containing copper and is similar in structure to uroporphyrin. The author's experiments reveal that turacin is not a pure uroporphyrin I, but a mixture of uroporphyrin I and uroporphyrin III. This finding challenges the previous understanding of porphyrin isomers and their roles in various diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Porphyrin Chemistry"}
