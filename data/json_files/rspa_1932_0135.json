They used a magnet with a 17,992-gauss field and a 3-mm gap, and observed the effect of the magnetic field on the light propagation. The experiment was performed in a vacuum using a mercury condensation pump and charcoal in liquid air to evacuate the apparatus. The results provided insights into the behavior of light in the presence of magnetic fields, which is essential for understanding the interaction between light and matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
