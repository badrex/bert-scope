He discovered that the color change was caused by the madder root, a plant used to fix colors on cloth. The experiment involved feeding a cock with a mixture of madder root and fig dust, which resulted in the cock's bones turning red within sixteen days. This finding suggests that madder root is responsible for the color change, but the reason why only bones are affected remains unclear."}
