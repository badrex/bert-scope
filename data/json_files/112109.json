The author argues that the brains of marsupials and monotremes have unique characteristics that distinguish them from other mammals, and that the term \"corpus callosum\" should be applied to the upper commissure of the marsupial brain, despite its differences from the placental mammal's corpus callosum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
