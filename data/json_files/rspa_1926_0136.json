They find that the lift is given by the Kutta-Joukowski theorem, while the drag is associated with a particular term in the solution that corresponds to an inward flow along the tail and an outward flow across a large contour. The study assumes periodic motion and provides expressions for the average lift and drag forces, which can be used to estimate the forces experienced by the cylinder.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
