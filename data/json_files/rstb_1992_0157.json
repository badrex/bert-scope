The research finds that badgers have two peaks of reproductive activity, with winter/spring matings being more important for overall productivity. The presence of annexe sets helps younger sows avoid aggression from dominant sows, leading to increased productivity. Living in large social groups has no net reproductive gain for adult males or females, and productivity declines with increasing group size.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
