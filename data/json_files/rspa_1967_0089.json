They also analyzed the intensity of the lowest frequency vibration in the p-substituted benzenes, finding a marked variation with different halogen substituents. This study provides a better understanding of the vibrational properties of substituted benzenes and their chemical structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
