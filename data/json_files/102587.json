When mixed together, these liquors produce a fine carmine color without any noticeable fermentation or alteration. The first liquor is made by infusing dried red roses in rectified spirit of wine, while the second liquor is made by adding a few drops of acid or oil of sulfur to good spirit of wine. This method was presented to the Royal Society, where it successfully produced the expected results."}
