The authors develop an upper bound for the hybrid median strength and demonstrate that the strength distribution for the hybrid composite has a weakest link structure. They also discuss the importance of understanding the behavior of hybrid composites under load for their potential use in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
