The research reveals unique features in the organization of the pigment epithelium, including the presence of guanine platelets that may function as a reflector. The findings provide insights into the diverse functions of the pigment epithelium in anchovy fish eyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
