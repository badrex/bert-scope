They studied the biting flies in Uganda and found that Tabanid flies, specifically Tabanus secedens, were common carriers of the disease. The study also provided insights into the natural history and habits of these flies, which are essential for understanding the transmission of trypanosome diseases in Africa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
