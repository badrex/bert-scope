The author also discusses the importance of minimizing compliance in the recording equipment to obtain accurate measurements and suggests that the ultimate value of P/IJH would be around 13 if compliance from the muscle itself, tendons, and other factors could be eliminated.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
