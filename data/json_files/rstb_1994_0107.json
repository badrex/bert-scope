The Fas receptor is a member of the tumor necrosis factor (TNF)/nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor family and is involved in various physiological processes. The Fas ligand, a death factor, binds to the Fas receptor, leading to cell death or apoptosis. This process is essential for maintaining tissue homeostasis and preventing the development of malignancy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
