The research shows how different beak and body size proportions among adult finches are achieved through ontogeny. The results demonstrate that evolutionary changes in embryonic, nestling, and post-fledging growth characteristics contribute to the adaptive differentiation of Darwin's finch species in adult bill morphology and size.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
