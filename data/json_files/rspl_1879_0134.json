They discovered that the electrical effect of excitation manifests itself in two phases, an initial and a terminal one, with opposite signs. The initial phase begins 0.06 seconds after excitation and rapidly reaches its maximum, while the reversal of sign occurs at 0.26 seconds. These findings contribute to the understanding of the physiological relations of the excitatory state in excitable tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology > Cardiology"}
