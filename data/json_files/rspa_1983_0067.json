The authors highlight the dangers of missing subharmonic resonances due to coexisting stable solutions and the importance of exploring a comprehensive set of initial conditions. They also explore the chaotic behavior of these oscillators, which can arise in well-defined deterministic resonance problems, and the need for a statistical description of these motions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Civil Engineering"}
