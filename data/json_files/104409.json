He observes that despite being exposed to harsh conditions, shells remain intact and uncorrupted. He also notes that the soal-fish, which feeds on shellfish, is able to digest them without the need for a strong jaw or teeth, suggesting that it may use a special solvent to break down the shells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
