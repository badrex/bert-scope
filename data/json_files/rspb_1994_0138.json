Results show that resistant populations have lower 16-day larval mass, smaller pupal mass, and longer development time, indicating that insecticide resistance is associated with life-history costs. This suggests that alternating insecticides to which the obliquebanded leafroller is not resistant could be a valuable strategy for managing this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
