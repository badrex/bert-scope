The St. Kitts monkeys have larger teeth and show a decrease in variance of linear dimensions. The research suggests that these changes are due to selection acting on the original genetic constitution of the green monkeys in the Caribbean. The findings provide insights into the effects of geographic isolation on primate evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
