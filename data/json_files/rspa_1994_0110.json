The linear problem for this equation is embedded in the Loewner-Konopelchenko-Rogers representation, which is a reinterpretation and generalization of a class of infinitesimal Backlund transformations. The author demonstrates the richness of this extension through various canonical dimensional reductions and specializations, leading to formal analogues of well-known integrable systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
