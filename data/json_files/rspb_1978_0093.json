This approach is particularly useful for analyzing loci with multiple alleles and provides a dynamical picture for the neutral infinite-alleles model. The text also surveys the theory of diffusion approximations and discusses the current understanding of existence, uniqueness, and approximation in these models.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
