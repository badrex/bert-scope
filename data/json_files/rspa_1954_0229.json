The authors explore the effects of compressibility and the role of bubbles in fluid dynamics, leading to a discussion of a relaxation phenomenon. They find that the volume viscosity of water reaches its maximum value when bubbles are approximately 20 diameters apart.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
