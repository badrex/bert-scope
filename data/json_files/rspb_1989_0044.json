The crab's specialized chelal morphology allows it to break open shells effectively, and its foraging tactics differ from those of the temperate crab Carcinus maenas. The research finds that the crab can assess the defensive strength of its prey and select suitable sizes for consumption.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
