The author argues that small-angle scattering, caused by low-temperature phonons and extended defects, can be as effective as isotropic scattering in disrupting the distribution function. The study discusses various examples, including the size effect and magnetoresistance phenomena, and analyzes special models to understand the role of small-angle scattering in metallic conduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
