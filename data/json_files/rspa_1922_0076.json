They used a combination of spectroscopic and current-voltage tests to study the minimum electron energies required for different types of ionization. The experiments confirmed previous findings on the minimum resonance radiation voltage and the minimum ionization voltage for electrons in argon. They also discovered that certain blue spectrum lines are associated with the removal of two electrons from the normal argon atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
