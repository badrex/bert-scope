It reveals that during the larval and early stages, herrings lack red blood cells, which only appear after a certain point in their development. The research also compares the blood cell formation process in herring to that of other teleostean fishes and provides insights into the unique life cycle of herring.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Fish Biology"}
