Van Marum's generators played a significant role in his electrical studies, and his innovations in design led to improvements in the efficiency and power of these machines. The article highlights the influence of English ideas and designs on Dutch instrument-making during this period.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
