The author discusses the hypothesis of a relationship between chimaeroids and ptyctodont arthrodires and reviews the evidence for a connection between Holocephali and selachians or arthrodires. The study concludes that chimaeroids are closest to the most primitive arthrodires, suggesting a common ancestor but not a direct relationship.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
