The study investigates the defense reactions of the caterpillar and finds that eggs of Nemeritis escape encapsulation because they do not stimulate the blood cells to react. The property that enables them to avoid evoking a reaction is located on their surface, which is acquired in the region of the calyx.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
