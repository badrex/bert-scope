The authors analyze the effects of volume diffusion and interface kinetics on step motion and provide explicit results for two- and three-step trains. They also examine the relative velocities of steps due to their interactions and discuss the implications for materials science and crystal growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystal Growth"}
