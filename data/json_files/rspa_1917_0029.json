They used a crystal-spectrometer and absorption screens to study the homogeneous components of the X-rays and their absorption coefficients. The results showed that different metals treated the X-rays differently, and the proportion of each radiation present in a beam of rays could be detected and analyzed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
