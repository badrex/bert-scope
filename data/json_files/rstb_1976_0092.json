The author explains how sequential interactions of proteins and packaging of nucleic acids contribute to the formation of virus particles. The study of phage assembly provides experimental model systems for understanding gene product regulation and the processes involved in virus formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
