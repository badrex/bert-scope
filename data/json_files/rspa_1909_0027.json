They used a vacuum tube with aluminum electrodes and a quartz plate to examine the gas. The secondary spectrum consists of two parts, with the first part composed of numerous intense lines in the orange and violet regions, and the second part appearing continuous. The primary spectrum lines were not very bright, and only eight primary lines were visible.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
