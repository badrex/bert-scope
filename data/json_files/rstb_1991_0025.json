The authors discuss experimental manipulations that enhance neuronal survival and axonal regeneration, leading to the restoration of functional connections. They also examine the role of the non-neuronal environment in the success of axonal regeneration and the molecular events that influence interactions between axonal growth cones and their non-neuronal substrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
