The authors verify Saha's ionization formula and discuss the implications of the results in the context of the barium anomaly in the solar spectrum. The findings support the explanation of this phenomenon involving weight factors and metastable states of barium ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
