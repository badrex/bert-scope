They found that the velocity distribution often followed Maxwell's law, but in some cases, the average kinetic energy was about twice that corresponding to the source temperature. The authors also discussed the effects of gas actions on the velocity distribution and proposed further experiments to explore the connection between gas actions and changes in the velocity distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
