They discovered that the bladder's muscular fibers are spiral fibers forming figure-of-8 loops, which play a crucial role in closing the ureters and urethra. The study also found that the prostate's structure is closely related to the bladder's muscular fibers, and the urethra's closure is completed by the contraction of specific fibers and the prominence of certain anatomical structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
