In the first stage, glyoxal reacts to produce carbon monoxide, glyoxalic acid, and other products. In the second stage, glyoxalic acid undergoes further oxidation to form oxalic acid, hydrogen peroxide, carbon dioxide, and water. The authors developed a mechanism similar to the one proposed for formaldehyde oxidation, which accounts for the observed facts. They used gas chromatography to analyze the products and provide detailed analytical studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reaction Mechanisms"}
