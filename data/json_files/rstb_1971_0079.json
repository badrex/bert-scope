This transport anomaly is due to a combination of factors, including the presence of an osmotic gradient, the organization of cells in an epithelium, and the interaction between solutes and solvent in the membrane. The author proposes a tentative model for this phenomenon, which involves local anomalous osmosis of the solvent exerting anomalous solvent drag on the driven species."}
