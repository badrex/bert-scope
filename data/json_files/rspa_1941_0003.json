They show that cascade cosmic ray showers of sufficient energy to produce some of these radio reflexions certainly exist, but there is not enough evidence to decide whether any of the observed echoes are actually due to such showers. More conclusive evidence could be obtained from the frequency-size distribution of the radio echoes observed from a horizontal or vertically directed beam.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
