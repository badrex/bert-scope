The authors demonstrate that these algorithms can contribute to functional segregation in the sensory cortex by eliminating uncorrelated inputs. They also discuss the potential implementation of these algorithms in the brain using associative mechanisms and decay terms.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroplasticity"}
