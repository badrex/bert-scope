The authors demonstrate that when wave dispersion is forced by using sloping upper and lower boundaries, these evolution equations can be transformed into the sine-Gordon equation. The study discusses the relation between the behavior in this model and that in discrete-layer models of baroclinic instability and compares the solutions with experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
