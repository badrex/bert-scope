The study reveals an open birch woodland influenced by local edaphic conditions, with important aquatic and pioneer associations on sand substrates. The findings suggest delayed immigration of climax species due to the flora's existence during an early interstadial of the Saalian, following the refrigeration that brought the Holstein to a close.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
