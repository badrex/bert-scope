The authors, E. Frankland and J. Norman Lockyer, investigate the behavior of magnesium and iron vapors in the sun's chromosphere and their spectral lines. They also conduct laboratory experiments to test their assumption that the absorption of light occurs mainly in the photosphere, which supports their theory that the photosphere and chromosphere form the true atmosphere of the sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
