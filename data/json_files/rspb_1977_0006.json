The authors describe their observations of the isthmus using endoscopy, which allowed them to better understand the anatomy and function of the isthmus and select more effective surgical procedures for treating cleft palate patients. This technique has improved the diagnosis and treatment of speech and palate-related issues, leading to better outcomes for patients.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Otorhinolaryngology (ENT)"}
