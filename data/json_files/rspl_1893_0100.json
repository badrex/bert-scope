They observed various bubble shapes and velocities depending on the volume of air and the size of the channel. The phenomenon was more pronounced in smaller channels and was similar to the initial shapes taken by liquid drops. The study also mentioned the behavior of different liquids and the application to the metallurgy of lead.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
