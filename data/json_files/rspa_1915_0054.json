B. Hardy explores the application of the principle of dynamical similitude to molecular physics. He discusses the energy content of molecular systems, the concept of stable and labile states, and the relationship between temperature and kinetic energy. Hardy also examines the law of equipartition of energy and its application to condensed systems, as well as the internal latent heat of substances in different states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
