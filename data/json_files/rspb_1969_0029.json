It explains that the nitrogen-fixing activity resides in the bacteroids, which are the symbiotic form of the root nodule bacteria. The primary product of nitrogen fixation is NH3, which is transformed into amino compounds used by the host plant. The article also covers the role of leghemoglobin, the 02 requirement of nodules, and the differences in cytochromes and related haemoproteins between cultured cells and bacteroids."}
