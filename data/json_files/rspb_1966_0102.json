The research supports the hypothesis that the remaining ovary consumes more follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) during ovulation, determining the number of eggs shed based on the duration of hormonal stimulus rather than the absolute hormone level in the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
