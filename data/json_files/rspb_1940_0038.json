They found that varying light intensity and the presence of urethane affected the ferric oxalate reaction. The results suggest that the light reaction in photosynthesis is the production of the oxygen molecule, rather than the reduction of carbon dioxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
