They demonstrate that conjugation energies are always positive, leading to increased stability in conjugated systems. The authors also discuss the calculation of conjugation energies and their relationship with bond orders, providing examples of conjugated hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
