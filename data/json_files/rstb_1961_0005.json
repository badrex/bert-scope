The rocks are part of a Tertiary volcanic center and are best exposed in the mountains of Hallival and Askival. The research confirms Brown's hypothesis of successive replenishment of the magma chamber to account for the major layering. The findings also suggest that the whole mass of ultrabasic rocks was pushed up as a hot, but essentially solid body, into its present position, and that there was differential uplift bringing relatively lower units in the west against higher units in the east.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Igneous Rocks"}
