It reveals that the ciliary band is organized as a self-contained unit supplying its own innervation, and the larval nervous system comprises a brain, four radiating nerve cords, and a peripheral system of ciliary nerves derived mainly from sensory cells in the band. This study supports the idea that Muller's larva is a primitive and primary larva, closely related to several other larval types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
