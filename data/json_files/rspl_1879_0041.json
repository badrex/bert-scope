They discovered that slow and continuous stress application can actually strengthen the wire, which could help correct misconceptions about the dangers of applying heavy loads to iron structures like steam boilers. The study also found that wires broken slowly had less elongation than those broken quickly.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
