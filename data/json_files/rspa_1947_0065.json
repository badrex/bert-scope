They found that all substances except water formed reversible adsorption and gaseous films at low pressures. Methyl and ethyl alcohols showed the adsorption of a second layer at higher pressures, while acetone formed a double layer and eventually a triple layer. The authors also discovered that water's large entropy and heat of adsorption indicated the association of adsorbed water molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
