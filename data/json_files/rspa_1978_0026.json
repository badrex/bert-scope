They demonstrate that these models are equivalent and use this connection to obtain the free energy, internal energy, and latent heat of the Potts model at its transition temperature. The results provide insights into the behavior of lattice models in statistical mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
