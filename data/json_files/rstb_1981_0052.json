It highlights the detection of genetic variation in gene structure and copy number, physical mapping of the chloroplast genome, identification of nuclear chromosomes by in situ hybridization, and the characterization of mitochondrial DNA sequences necessary for normal pollen development in maize. The author emphasizes the value of molecular analysis in plant genetics and its potential for enhancing our understanding of gene structure and genetic variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
