The results show that neither thyroid feeding nor thyro-parathyroidectomy affects the pituitrin load of the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Additionally, there is no evidence of pituitrin in the cerebro-spinal fluid of the fourth ventricle in normal, thyroid-fed, and thyro-parathyroidectomised cats. The blood of thyroid-fed cats has a greater depressor action on the circulation, while the blood of thyro-parathyroidectomised cats exercises a pressor effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
