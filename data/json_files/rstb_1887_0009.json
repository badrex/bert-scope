They analyze the skull, neck, and other skeletal features, comparing them to existing reptiles and other fossil reptiles. The author concludes that Protorosaurus Speneri was an aquatic creature with strong neck and head structures, and that its classification remains uncertain, with some suggesting it is a type of lizard and others proposing a new reptilian group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
