They discovered that some eggs can be resistant to foreign sperm, leading to cytolysis or abnormal development. The study highlights the complexity of cross-species fertilization and the factors affecting embryonic development in sea urchins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Development"}
