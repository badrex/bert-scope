They discovered three distinct inductive interactions: mesoderm induction, dorsalization, and neural induction. These findings reveal the complexity of body plan formation in early embryos and provide insights into the mechanisms of regional specification and gene expression control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
