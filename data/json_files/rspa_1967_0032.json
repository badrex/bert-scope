The author explains the physical principles and methods for studying these properties, focusing on the measurement of thermal radiation flux and effective temperature. The study helps determine the dielectric constant, density, and other properties of planetary materials, as well as understanding the variable thermal regime and surface temperature fluctuations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Planetary Science"}
