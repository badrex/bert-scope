The study reveals that the resistance to shear varies depending on the orientation of the crystal plane, with the least resistance occurring when the plane of slip coincides with a crystal plane of type {110}. This research contributes to understanding the deformation mechanisms of metal alloys and their crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
