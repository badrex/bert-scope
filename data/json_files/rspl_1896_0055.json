They found that liquid oxygen has a dielectric constant close to 1.6, and the low temperature effects cause a marked reduction in the dielectric constant of materials like glass and paraffined paper. The authors also discussed the relationship between the dielectric constant, magnetic permeability, and refractive index, showing that liquid oxygen closely obeys Maxwell's law.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
