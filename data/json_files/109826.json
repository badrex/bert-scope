He examines colors found in ruins of ancient Rome and Pompeii, including red, yellow, blue, green, and black. Davy discovers that many colors were made from natural materials like minerals, metals, and earth, and that some colors, like the famous Tyrian purple, were made from rare and expensive sources. This research helps us understand the techniques and materials used by ancient painters and provides insight into the art and culture of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
