They measured volume and salt fluxes under pressure gradients and calculated non-equilibrium thermodynamic conductance coefficients. The results showed that the coefficients are strong functions of solution concentration, which affects the use of integral flux equations in small concentration intervals across the membrane.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Membrane Science"}
