They determined the first and second ionization potentials of diacetylene and concluded that the frequencies in the Rydberg states of diacetylene are very similar to those of the ground state of the neutral molecule. The results provide insights into the electronic transitions and molecular structure of diacetylene.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
