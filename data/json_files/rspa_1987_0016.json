The research focuses on the effects of molecular mass, molecular mass distribution, temperature, sliding velocity, and duct length on the electrification process. The findings provide insights into the factors responsible for electrification and the influence of polymer straining conditions, duct material, and dimensions on the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
