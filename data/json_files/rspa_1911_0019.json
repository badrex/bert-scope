They propose that the solar wind, consisting of charged particles ejected by the sun, can cause magnetic storms by increasing the ionization of the Earth's outer atmosphere and enhancing the electric currents. This theory explains the connection between solar outbursts and changes in the Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
