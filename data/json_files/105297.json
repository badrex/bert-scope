The author, Nicholas Jenty, performed an autopsy and observed that the peritonaeum, or outer membrane of the intestines, was abnormally thick. He also found unusual lymphatic gland growth and large cysts in the aorta. The case highlights the challenges of treating such rare conditions and the importance of further research into the underlying causes.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pathology"}
