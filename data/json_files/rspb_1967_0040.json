The author explores possible hydrolytic mechanisms and examines the role of specific amino acids in the enzyme's catalytic process. The study uses various substrates and experimental methods to understand how lysozyme works and how it might be improved as a catalyst.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
