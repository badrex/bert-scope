They extend the equations of motion to a 5-dimensional continuum and suggest that these equations may have more than a formal significance. The author also discusses the wave equation for charged and neutral particles, showing how it relates to the propagation of light in empty space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
