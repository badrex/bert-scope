They discovered that the existing equations remain accurate in the critical region and can represent critical phenomena with greater accuracy than the van der Waals equation. The author also found that the critical point occurs at a slightly higher temperature than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
