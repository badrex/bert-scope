The author extends Rayleigh's theory of surface tension and presents a simple and clear explanation of how surface tension arises from cohesive attraction. The article also covers the historical development of capillarity theories and provides a comprehensive understanding of surface energy and surface tension in various materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
