They discovered a melting point for stearic acid monolayers on mica and found that the energy of activation for diffusion is 42 and below. The authors also compared the diffusion of stearic acid on different metals and discussed the transfer process in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Chemistry"}
