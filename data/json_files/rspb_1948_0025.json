This hypothesis explains how the cochlea can achieve high resonance and overcome the limitations of viscous damping in the basilar membrane. The cochlear microphonic potential, previously an unexplained by-product, plays a crucial role in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hearing and Auditory System"}
