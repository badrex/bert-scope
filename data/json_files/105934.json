The method allows for better healing and reduces pain and inconvenience for the patient. The author also suggests a new posture for the patient during recovery, which is more comfortable and convenient than the traditional extended position.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Orthopedic Surgery"}
