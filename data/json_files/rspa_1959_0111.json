They found that the molecule has a large and irregular shape, packing in a manner reminiscent of cylindrical shapes. The study supports the formulation of the hexacarboxylic acid and provides insights into its molecular arrangement in the crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
