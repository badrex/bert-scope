The study analyzes hourly measurements of terrestrial magnetic elements over several years, considering the impact of temperature variations and instrument adjustments. The results show that while some patterns exist, they are not strong enough to definitively link the changes to solar rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Magnetism"}
