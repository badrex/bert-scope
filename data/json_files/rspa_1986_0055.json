The study focuses on the two-dimensional autocorrelation and spectral density functions of the smoothed surface, which are calculated in terms of the corresponding functions of the reference surface and the properties of the 'footprint' of the contact. The research is relevant to the field of vehicle dynamics, as it helps in understanding the interaction between a rubber-tyred wheel and the ground."}
