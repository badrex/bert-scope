It suggests relations between large nuts and rodents, primates and fleshy fruits, and the expansion of dry fruits and seeds consumption by mammals after the terminal Cretaceous dinosaur extinction. The study examines the ways in which plants and plant-eating mammals have interacted over the past 70 million years using fossil evidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
