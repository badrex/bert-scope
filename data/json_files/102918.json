He discovered that the worms could not survive in water and must be found in the soil itself. The worms were carried to the sheep by consuming grass from infested land. The author also found various types of small organisms in the soil and water, some of which had unique features like protruding wheels or horns from their bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
