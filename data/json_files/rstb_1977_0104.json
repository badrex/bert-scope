The data provides a detailed record of the advance and retreat of ice masses in the northern hemisphere, allowing for the study of ice-sheet dynamics and glacial history. The oxygen isotope record also serves as a valuable tool for understanding glacio-eustatic sea-level changes during the Last Cold Stage.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
