The author argues that the arc's behavior can be logically predicted from its conditions of existence and does not require the aid of negative resistance or large back voltage. The author also discusses the role of carbon vapor, mist, and burning gases in the formation and maintenance of the arc.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
