The research finds that the duration of the twitch is always slightly greater than the duration of the after-action of a tetanus. The study also shows that fatigue can be identified by the increase in the duration of the after-action above that of the twitch, and the disappearance of the \"angle\" at the end of the plateau in the muscle contraction curve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
