The model incorporates both Fickian and generalized Fickian diffusion, as well as the viscoelastic response of the polymer. The study demonstrates how this model can predict a broad range of swelling behaviors and diffusion profiles, depending on various parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
