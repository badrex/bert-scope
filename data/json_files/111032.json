It highlights the excessive rainfall in the area and how it increases with altitude. The author also notes that the climate in the mountain valleys is milder and more equable than the surrounding areas, attributing this to the heat from the lakes and the condensation of vast amounts of vapor.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
