They found four common mangrove species growing along the shores of the atoll's lagoon, with varying levels of abundance and zonation patterns. The mangrove forests on Aldabra are distinct from those found on continental shores, with a more widespread presence of the fern Acrostichum aureum and a lack of competition for growth space.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
