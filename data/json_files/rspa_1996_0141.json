The researchers developed a mathematical model and conducted experiments to understand the behavior of oxygen and fuel concentrations in the cells. The findings can be used to design more efficient and cost-effective solid oxide fuel cell systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fuel Cells and Energy Storage"}
