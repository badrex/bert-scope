The effective medium approach is considered the best method for steady-state problems, and sink strengths for voids, dislocations, dislocation loops, and grain boundaries are analyzed. The article also addresses criticisms of the effective medium method and provides a comprehensive review of the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Defect Theory"}
