The results show that tension is maintained by a system similar to vertebrate striated muscle, with the ABRM system being specialized in that tension decay can be extremely slow. The sliding filament contractile mechanism is proposed, which involves linkages between two kinds of filaments and the concentration of a relaxant (probably 5-hydroxytryptamine) governing the rate of tension decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
