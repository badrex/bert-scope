They found a small energy shift caused by the application of an electric field and determined the tensor polarizability for the hyperfine structure. The theoretical value, including hyperfine structure effects, agreed with the experimental results, confirming the special nature of the quadratic Stark effect in this case.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
