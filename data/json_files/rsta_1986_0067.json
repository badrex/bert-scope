It explores the use of local densities of states, surface bonds, and rate processes in the context of adsorption and gas-surface dynamics. The author highlights the importance of energy exchange between adsorbates and substrates in catalytic reactions and the role of promoters and poisons in affecting the activation barriers of chemisorption processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
