The author found that water coagulates the eggs, while alkalies, salts, and some acids do not. The author also suggests that the coagulation of fish eggs may serve a purpose in attracting predators to the dead eggs, protecting the living ones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
