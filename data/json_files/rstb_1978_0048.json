The main structural component is a tectin type protein with a-helical regions and a small amount of polysaccharide. The protein forms sheets that have a helicoidal organization, which is a cholesteric liquid crystal type often found in biological contexts. This helicoidal layering is observed as parabolic lamellae in oblique sections of the periostracum. The study compares the periostracum's structure and composition with other molluscan periostraca and periostracum-like structures in other invertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
