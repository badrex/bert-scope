This tolerance is due to the delay in the formation of natural antibodies against the virus. The study provides evidence for the existence of at least one immunologically distinctive host component for the Rous agent and offers a method to identify such components.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
