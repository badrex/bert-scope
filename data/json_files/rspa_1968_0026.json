They found that the spin wave energy follows a specific law at low temperatures and calculated its numerical values for a single tightly bound energy band corresponding to a simple cubic lattice structure. The results provide insights into the behavior of ferromagnetic materials and can be used to analyze experimental data related to spin wave resonance methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
