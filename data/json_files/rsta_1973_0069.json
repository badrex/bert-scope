They find that the external gravitational couple may play a role in tectonism and that the Earth's internal heat is dissipated by convection ordered by the tidal couple. The study suggests that upwelling occurs in high latitudes and low latitudes, affecting the lithosphere's displacement and rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
