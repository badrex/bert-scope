The authors describe various reactions and mechanisms, including the combination of carbenes, carbynes, alkynes, and olefins at the diruthenium center, which could help explain the wide spectrum of hydrocarbon products in the Fischer-Tropsch synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
