He found that bromide of ethylene, derived from diatomic alcohol (glycol), could be treated with cyanide of potassium to form cyanide of ethylene. This process allowed the production of succinic acid, similar to how propionic acid is derived from ordinary alcohol. Simpson plans to further investigate this method with other hydrocarbons in the CnHn series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
