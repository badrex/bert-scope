Young discovered the principle of interference, which was a significant step in the development of the wave theory. He also pointed out the shortcomings of the corpuscular theory of light and explained how the wave theory could better explain optical phenomena. Young's work at the Royal Institution helped establish the institution as a center for scientific research and education.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
