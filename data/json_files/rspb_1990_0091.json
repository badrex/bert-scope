The model calculates population size and grain production under different climate scenarios over a 20-year projection time. The results suggest that the number of hunger-related deaths could significantly increase if grain production does not keep pace with population growth and unfavorable climatic conditions prevail. The model highlights the importance of reducing population growth rates as a strategy for minimizing the impact of global climate change and maintaining food supplies for everyone.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Change and Agriculture"}
