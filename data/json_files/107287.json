In acute angled triangles, the sum of the tangents multiplied by the radius squared is equal to the continued product of the tangents. In obtuse angled triangles, the same relationship holds true. The author provides a demonstration using trigonometry and mathematical proof.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
