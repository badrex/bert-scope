The authors prove that all values between 4 and infinity can be realized by making a suitable choice of coefficients in the given inequality. The proof depends on the general theory of the inequality and the properties of solutions of the differential equation associated with it. The analysis leads to a set of best possible inequalities for certain Bessel functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
