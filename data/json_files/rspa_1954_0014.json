They cooled single crystals to very low temperatures using adiabatic demagnetization and measured the anisotropic distribution of gamma rays emitted from the oriented nuclei. The largest anisotropy observed was 33%, and the results were fitted to theoretical curves to deduce the magnetic moment of cobalt-60.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
