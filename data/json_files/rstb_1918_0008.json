They observe that enamel in marsupials differs from that of other mammals due to the presence of structures called fibrils, which are continuous with the dentine tubules. These fibrils are most developed in Macropodids and are absent in wombats. The author discusses various theories on the formation and structure of enamel and presents their findings on the life cycle of the enamel cells in marsupials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
