This algorithm helps in identifying potential site points for ligand attachment and can be used as part of a knowledge base for automated site-directed drug design. The program generates a map of hydrogen-bonding regions, which can be used to create novel ligands that fit specified binding sites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
