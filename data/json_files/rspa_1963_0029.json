They analyze the model using an exact Master equation and expand it systematically in reciprocal powers of the piston mass. The study provides insights into non-linear fluctuations and helps establish a connection between the non-linear phenomenological damping law and the equilibrium distribution of the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical mechanics"}
