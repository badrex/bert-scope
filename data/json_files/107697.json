They discover that these flatworms can reproduce both sexually, through eggs, and asexually, by dividing their bodies. They also describe the unique feeding habits of Planaria, using a tube-like organ to capture and hold their prey, rather than using their mouths.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
