It highlights how the absence of testes during critical developmental stages leads to the development of feminine structures, while the presence of testes imposes masculinity. The study also examines the influence of hormones on the hypothalamus, neural structures, and other tissues, emphasizing the importance of testicular hormones in determining the sexual differentiation of the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
