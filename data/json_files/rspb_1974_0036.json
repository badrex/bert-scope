It shows that chloroplasts in leaves grown under shade have thicker grana than those grown in full light. When plants are transferred from light to shade, the grana thickness changes in response to decreased light intensity, but not when transferred from shade to light. This suggests that chloroplasts in mature apple leaves can react to changes in their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
