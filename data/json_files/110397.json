He discovered the internal fluid dynamics and movements in these organisms, including the flow of particles and currents within their tubes and the fluctuations in the size of their stomachs and mouths. Lister also observed the absence of cilia and currents in some polyps and described the circulation of water and blood in Ascidians. His findings provide insights into the anatomy, physiology, and behavior of these marine organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
