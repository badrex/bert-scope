The researchers determined the rate constants for the reaction with various bases and compared the isotope effects and rate relations to other carbon acids. The findings provide insights into the ionization process and the behavior of 1,1-dinitroethane in different buffer solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Chemistry"}
