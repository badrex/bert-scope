The authors made accurate determinations of the doublet separations for the first four members of the series using a spectrograph and a discharge tube. Their results support Sommerfeld's theory, which predicts that the doublet separations should be constant for all members of the Balmer series.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
