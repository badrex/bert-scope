He found that the spermatozoa are the impregnating agents and that they do not penetrate the egg's envelope. The author also discovered that the chemical composition of spermatozoa is the same across different animal classes and that motion is essential for successful impregnation. He proposed a new view of impregnation, suggesting that it is caused by a unique force in the spermatozoa, which he called \"sperm-force.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
