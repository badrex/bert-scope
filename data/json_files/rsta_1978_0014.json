It highlights the importance of interface failure, grain boundaries, and the role of stress systems in the fracture process. The authors also explore the influence of temperature, strain rate, and material composition on the ductility and fracture behavior of materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomechanics"}
