They suggest that nerve and muscle fibers act as charged Leyden jars and that the electrical differences between the sides and ends of the fibers are differences in kind. The author also explores the electrical phenomena that occur when nerve and muscle pass from rest to action, suggesting that a discharge similar to that of the Torpedo occurs during this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
