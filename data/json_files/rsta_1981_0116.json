The author presents thermal and geochemical models for the massive magmatic thickening of the crust, focusing on the late Archaean period, 2900-2600 million years ago, when the generation of juvenile continental crust was particularly vigorous. The study integrates numerical simulations, tectonic, petrological, and geochemical observations to explore the metamorphic and geochemical consequences of massive crust thickening during short-lived accretion episodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
