He noted the chameleon's ability to change color, the structure of its skin, eyes, and mouth, as well as its internal organs, such as the heart, lungs, liver, and intestines. Goddard's observations provided a detailed understanding of the chameleon's unique features and contributed to the study of reptiles and zoology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
