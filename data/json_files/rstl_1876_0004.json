They find that Heliopora is an alcyonarian, which challenges previous beliefs about the classification of corals. The study provides insights into the anatomy and affinities of these corals, contributing to a better understanding of their classification and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Coral Biology"}
