The study finds that for basic state vorticity distributions with non-zero circulation, the perturbation tends to a steady solution, while for zero circulation, the perturbation grows without bound. This has important implications for the stability of isolated eddies in geophysics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics > Vortex Stability"}
