They found that metastable nitrogen atoms, predicted by Hund's theory, are present in active nitrogen and are chemically active. This discovery supports the theory that explains the energy relations and the after-glow phenomenon in active nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
