They demonstrate the equivalence of these methods when applying a normalization condition to the fundamental mode, and discuss the convergence of the method of multiple scales. The study focuses on plane Poiseuille flow as a typical example of two-dimensional parallel shear flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
