They described the radiator's design, the method of electrical winding, and the temperature measurement techniques. The radiator's efficiency was compared to a traditional Herseus furnace, showing that the new design provided better uniformity and efficiency in radiant heat transfer experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heating and Refrigeration Systems"}
