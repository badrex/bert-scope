The researchers discovered that the stress distribution in each plastically deformed grain can be resolved into two parts: pure bending about two perpendicular axes in the glide plane and a continuously varying stress distribution. The study provides insights into the nature of internal stresses in materials and their deformation mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
