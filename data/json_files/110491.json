The results showed that the magnetic influence of the iron caused deviations in the compass, and the author provided recommendations for placing the steering compass in iron steam-vessels to minimize these effects. The study also compared the effects of local attraction on different steam-boats.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval engineering"}
