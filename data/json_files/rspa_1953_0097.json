They found that both aldehydes are involved in a single kinetic chain, and by analyzing the aldehyde ratio during oxidation, they determined the relative reactivity of the two aldehydes to a given peroxy radical. This study provides insights into the oxidation of multi-component systems and the reactivity of radicals and dissimilar radicals in chain processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
