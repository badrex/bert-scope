They found that the shifts in the higher terms showed anomalies due to perturbations and hyperfine structures. The results, combined with other measurements, showed that the values of the isotope shifts given by the theory of Hughes and Eckart were too high by amounts up to 20%.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
