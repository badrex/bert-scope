The research finds that rifts in the southeast part of the Hawaiian chain are influenced by gravitational stress fields, while the influence of regional Pacific structure is suspected in only six volcanoes that grew as simple, isolated shields. The findings provide insight into the relationship between rift orientation and regional forces in the Hawaiian Archipelago.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Volcanology"}
