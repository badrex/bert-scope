This method can be used to compute flows with separation more accurately, especially when the FLARE approximation is insufficient. The results show that the time-dependent approach can improve the accuracy of solutions obtained from the FLARE approximation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
