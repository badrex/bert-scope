The authors analyzed data from 125 experiments involving 21 different crops exposed to constant SO2 concentrations in chambers. They found a linear relationship between SO2 concentration and percentage yield loss. The results show that there is significant variability in response between species and within different exposure chambers. The authors discuss the factors that contribute to this variability and the implications for dose-response relations used in cost-benefit analysis of SO2 emission control.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Air Pollution and Climate Change"}
