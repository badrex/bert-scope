The theory is based on the assumption that certain stresses can be treated as zero, leading to a more accurate calculation of the potential energy due to strain. The author also discusses the equations of motion and boundary conditions for these shells.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
