They used electrical measurements to determine the concentration of free hydrogen ions in solutions containing gelatine and varying concentrations of acid or base. The results showed that gelatine's interaction with acid and base can be represented by a curve with three sections, involving multiple groups of hydroxyl ions with similar ionization constants. This study provides a better understanding of gelatine's behavior in acid-base systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Chemistry"}
