They discovered that ionized helium molecules are formed through an attachment process, where only one atom is excited or ionized, while the other remains in the normal state. The research also revealed that atomic ions are produced below the ionization potential due to a different process involving metastable atoms and electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
