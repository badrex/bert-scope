They explain how the convergence point allows for the filtering and overlap of different afferent impulses, leading to a functional limit in the mechanical response of muscle fibers. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the central overlap of different afferents on motor units and its implications for neurological research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurology"}
