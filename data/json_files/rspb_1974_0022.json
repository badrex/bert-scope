The study reveals the success of Stellaria media, which is predominantly self-fertilized, and contrasts it with less widespread and less successful closely related species that are frequently cross-fertilized. The author suggests that the success of Stellaria media can be attributed to its intrinsic variability, which is demonstrated by its polymorphic and polybiotic characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
