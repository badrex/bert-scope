They derived theoretical formulae for the rotation of the orbital plane and the change in orbital inclination due to the influence of the atmosphere. The results showed reasonable agreement with observations and highlighted the importance of considering atmospheric rotation when estimating the harmonics of the Earth's gravitational field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
