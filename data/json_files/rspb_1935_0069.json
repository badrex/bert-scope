They discovered that when animals switch from a high to low level of nitrogen intake, there is a lag before they reach nitrogen equilibrium. The authors found that the continuing metabolism resembles a first-order reaction and persists even when nitrogen equilibrium is being maintained. They also studied the effects of different diets on nitrogen and sulphur excretion in humans, concluding that the liver has a large capacity to convert ammonia to urea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nutrition and Metabolism"}
