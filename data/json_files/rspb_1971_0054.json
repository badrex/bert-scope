The author uses a singular perturbation approach to study the equation suggested by Wyman to explain the enhanced diffusion of oxygen in a haemoglobin solution. The results for myoglobin are also given. The findings are consistent with experimental data and show that haemoglobin and myoglobin are essentially in equilibrium with oxygen in the solution. This research has implications for understanding oxygen transport in the body and could lead to improvements in medical treatments related to oxygen delivery.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
