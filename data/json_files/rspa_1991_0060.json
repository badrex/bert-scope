The model explains the observed scale effect in ice forces and predicts a relation between force and area consistent with field observations. The research also shows that the fragment size distribution in broken materials has a fractal character, with a fractal dimension typically around 2.5.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
