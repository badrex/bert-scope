Partial differential approximants are defined systematically, and their theory is developed. The article addresses questions of existence and uniqueness and establishes broad criteria under which the approximants are faithful to the original series. It also explores the invariance properties of approximants and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Approximation theory"}
