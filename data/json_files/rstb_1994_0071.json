It addresses three main problems: analyzing fingerprint data to identify overlapping clones, predicting the rate of progress of mapping strategies, and designing optimal pooling schemes for screening large clone libraries. The author discusses various fingerprinting techniques, such as restriction digest data, hybridization outcomes, and end-specific probe hybridization, and presents methods for detecting pairwise overlaps and calculating posterior overlap probabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
