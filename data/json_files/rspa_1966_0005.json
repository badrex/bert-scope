The authors use a combination of Lorentz transformations and space-time translations to create a unitary norm for multiplets of the little group, allowing for the study of particles in motion. The focus is on the non-compact rest-symmetry group, which contains the successful compact rest-symmetry as a subgroup. The article demonstrates the procedure for embedding a rest-symmetry into a relativistic manifold and discusses the resulting maximal residual symmetries for matrix elements involving different numbers of momenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
