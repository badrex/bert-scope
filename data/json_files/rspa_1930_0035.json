The authors discuss the complexity of the effects occurring at solid surfaces and the difficulty of interpreting them in terms of atomic processes. They suggest that the crystal structure of the target may influence the critical potentials, and experiments with a single crystal of iron are being carried out to explore this idea further.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
