They found that the exchange occurs across mitochondrial membranes and can be stimulated or inhibited by agents that affect mitochondrial electron transport. The study suggests that cardiac mitochondria could partially affect relaxation, especially during the peak of contraction, by regulating intracellular calcium levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
