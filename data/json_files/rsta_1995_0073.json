The authors analyze meteorological data and ice cores to understand recent climate change in the High Arctic, including fluctuations in Arctic ice mass extent, and discuss the links between High Arctic ice masses and climate in the context of global sea-level rise.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
