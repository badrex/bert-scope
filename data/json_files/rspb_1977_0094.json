They found that intracellular free calcium rises during a twitch and examined the relationship between membrane potential and calcium release. The results indicate that calcium in the bathing solution does not significantly contribute to calcium transients during single twitches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
