The authors apply the variation method to calculate the binding energies using various trial wave functions and analyze the results. They find that the binding energy of deuterium is significantly greater than twice that of a single proton, suggesting the presence of an attractive force between neutrons and protons. The authors also discuss the limitations of the variation method and the challenges of accurately calculating binding energies for short-range interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
