Inadequate light and darkness can lead to nodule bacteria becoming parasitic, attacking the host plant's cells and causing nodule tissue to disintegrate. This research highlights the importance of understanding plant-host interactions and the factors that can influence symbiotic relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
