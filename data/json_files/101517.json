They argue that these organs are composed entirely of vessels, which play a crucial role in blood circulation and muscle physiology. This discovery has implications for understanding the function of the human body and could lead to new insights into health and disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
