It highlights the differences between rodent and human cells in the processes of amplification and resistance to antimetabolites. The article also explores the various mechanisms of resistance and the importance of understanding these processes in normal cells and tumor development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
