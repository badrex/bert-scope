They propose a geometric characterization of the embedding dimension using orthogonal projections and address the sample size requirements for its estimation. The study shows that the curse of dimensionality can be mitigated, making it possible to estimate the embedding dimension with fewer data points.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
