The author discusses the unknown continuous opacity and its impact on solar models, comparing results on the Sun with those obtained from stars in the same spectral region. The study emphasizes the importance of accurate measurements in understanding the solar EUV continuum and its effects on the Earth's upper atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
