Blood groups are ideal characters for tracking inheritance and understanding genetic traits. They are dominant characters and have a clear classification, making them useful for chromosome mapping. The author highlights the progress made in identifying blood group systems and their potential for further research in human genetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
