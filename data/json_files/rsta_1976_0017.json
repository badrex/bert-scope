It examines the Archean and Proterozoic history of the Australian continent, focusing on the cratonic provinces and their tectonic grain. The study highlights the role of mantle plumes, rift tectonics, and major cratonic separation events in shaping the continental margin. The article also presents new aspects and interpretations of Australian cratonic tectonics to stimulate further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
