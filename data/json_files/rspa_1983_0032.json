They discuss the requirements for successful diamond growth, including ion penetration, sputtering rates, and radiation damage. Evidence for crystalline growth is presented through physical and chemical measurements. This technique offers a potential alternative to traditional high-temperature and high-pressure methods for diamond synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystal Growth"}
