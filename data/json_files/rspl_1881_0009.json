The lungs of newts and tritons are simple sacs without septa, making them ideal for microscopic examination. The research describes the arrangement and distribution of blood vessels, the presence of ciliated epithelium, and the numerous nerves that enter the lung. These nerves follow the pulmonary vein closely and form a plexus along its course. The study suggests that the non-striped muscle in the lung wall may be a representative of the muscular tissues found in the alimentary canal, and that the nerve plexus in the lung is comparable to Auerbach's or Meissner's plexus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
