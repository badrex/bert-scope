They discovered that the H-Y variant of Sxr arose from a partial deletion within the Sxr region, proposing a new model for the generation of the original Sxr region. This research has implications for understanding sex determination and the potential role of H-Y expression in spermatogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
