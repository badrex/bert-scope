They developed a method to create uniform specimens of these materials and used them in a setup to measure the gyro-magnetic resonance amplitude. The results showed that the gyro-magnetic ratio for magnetite was close to the theoretical value, while for cobalt, it was lower. The authors discussed the experimental difficulties and improvements made to achieve accurate measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
