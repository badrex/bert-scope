They observed a rapid rise in intensity at the reaction zone followed by a steady increase in flame temperature. The results were used to estimate the concentration of free radicals and provide insights into the velocity constants of ternary reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
