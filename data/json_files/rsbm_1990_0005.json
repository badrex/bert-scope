He made significant contributions to the understanding of plant cell walls and plastids before the advent of electron microscopy. Frey-Wyssling established his own school of thought and research, focusing on submicroscopic structures and techniques such as X-ray diffraction. He also played a crucial role in the development of electron microscopy in Switzerland and was a dedicated teacher and academic leader.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
