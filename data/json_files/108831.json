They explore methods for finding the highest common internal divisor of two functions of non-commutative symbols, multiplying linear factors, and calculating coefficients in the binomial theorem. The author also investigates a binomial theorem reciprocal to the previously considered binomial theorem and resolves symbolical functions into factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus"}
