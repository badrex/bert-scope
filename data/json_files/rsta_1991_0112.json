It highlights that while the frictional strength of the upper crust is high, the frictional resistance to motion along transform plate boundaries is extremely low. The author presents a conceptual model of stress and deformation along weak transform faults, showing that shear stress in the crust is generally high, whereas shear stresses resolved on planes parallel to the transform faults appear to be quite low. This model helps explain the patterns of stress and deformation observed along various transform faults around the world.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
