They examine the contribution of metastable states of atoms and molecules to electron densities and explore the possibility of accounting for these densities without requiring high solar energy in the ultra-violet spectrum. The authors also investigate the recombination coefficients and the absorption coefficients in the ionosphere, considering the impact of solar radiation and the temperature of the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
