The researchers used capture-recapture methods to estimate daily survival rates and population sizes, finding that melanistic forms of the moths have higher survival rates in industrialized areas due to better camouflage from predators. The results suggest that selective predation plays a role in the increase of melanistic morphs in these species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Biology"}
