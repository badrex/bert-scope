The analysis considers both mechanical forces and surface tension forces in the pit membrane. The results show that earlywood pits are more likely to be aspirated than latewood pits, and that the process involves significant creep in the radial cellulosic strands of the pit membrane.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Wood Science"}
