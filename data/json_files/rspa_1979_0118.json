They explain how these collisions can lead to population inversion necessary for interstellar maser action. The study considers various collision partners and their effects on the molecules' -doublet levels, providing qualitative predictions for population inversion and implications for maser action.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Molecular Physics"}
