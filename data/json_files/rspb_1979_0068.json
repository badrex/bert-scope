They found that axoplasm behaves as a classical Bingham body, with motion characterized by a yield stress and plastic viscosity. Both yield stress and plastic viscosity were found to be insensitive to sodium and ATP but could be dramatically reduced by millimolar concentrations of calcium and certain anions in the lyotropic series.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
