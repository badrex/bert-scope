The authors describe the three types of glial cells and their lineages, as well as the growth factors and cellular interactions that modulate cell division and differentiation. They also introduce the 0-2A adult progenitor cells, which have properties suitable for homeostatic maintenance in the mature nervous system and may play a role in understanding conditions like multiple sclerosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
