They find that the real area of contact is directly proportional to the load and independent of the apparent area, and that surfaces which touch elastically are not uncommon in engineering practice. The theory also indicates the existence of an elastic contact hardness, a composite quantity that plays a role in elastic contact similar to the conventional hardness in plastic contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
