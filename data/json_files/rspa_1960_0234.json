It discusses the properties of wave functions and the -matrix for various types of potentials, such as finite range potentials. The study reveals that the -matrix is a double-valued function of momentum or energy with branch points determined by the relativistic energy-momentum relationship.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
