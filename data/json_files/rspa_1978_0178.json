They prove the existence of a wave of greatest height and discuss its properties, including its discontinuity at the crest. The study involves the use of nonlinear integral equations and Fourier series analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics"}
