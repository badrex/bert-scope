The author compares the performance of two different devices, the Salter duck and a two-pontoon system, and finds that they have similar potential operating efficiencies if appropriate scales are chosen. The study also highlights the importance of considering the structure's freedom to move in multiple degrees of freedom for better performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ocean and Naval Engineering"}
