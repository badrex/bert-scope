The authors found that the incidence of decompression sickness increases when a conditioning exposure to pressure is followed by a test exposure, even if the test exposure is shorter. This suggests that gas bubbles are present in symptomless decompressions and raises the question of gas transport to the lungs as a factor that should be considered in designing decompression tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Physiology"}
