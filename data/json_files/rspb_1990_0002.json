The bees showed a preference for landing near the edges of the discs, especially when the boundaries provided contrast to the green-sensitive receptors. This suggests that edge detection in honeybees is primarily driven by signals from their green-sensitive photoreceptors, similar to color-blind edge detection in primates. This finding has implications for understanding how bees navigate and locate objects of interest, such as flowers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
