The glands are found in the anterior part of the alimentary tube and are connected to the blood vessels, suggesting a possible role in the formation of blood corpuscles or waste extraction. The author also discusses the development of these glands and their relationship to other structures, such as nephridial tubules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
