Their findings suggest that the D-loop region corresponds to the functional origin of replication and that synthesis proceeds in an initially unidirectional manner. The existence of replication pause sites, with the most prominent one coinciding with a major origin of lagging-strand synthesis, is also inferred.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
