They found that the crystals grow from isotropic, single-domain particles with cubo-octahedral morphology to elongated, anisotropic particles. The crystal growth mechanism involves the specific nucleation of the (111) face on an organic membrane, followed by unidirectional growth along the [112] direction. This research contributes to understanding the biological mediation of inorganic solid-state reactions and has potential applications in crystal growth technology and materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology and Biophysics"}
