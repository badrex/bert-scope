He discovered that the electrogenic state of nerves can be induced by momentary and slight voltaic currents and can induce phenomena of voltaism in other nerves. The author also observed that new and superadded circles can be created, resulting in muscular contractions. He concluded by stating that he avoided theoretical views and focused on the accurate detail of experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuropsychology"}
