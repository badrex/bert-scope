They observed the formation of color centers and analyzed the absorption bands, which helped them deduce the nature and mechanism of formation of these centers. The results showed differences in behavior between sodium and potassium azide salts under irradiation, providing insights into the photochemical and thermal decomposition of alkali azides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography and Spectroscopy"}
