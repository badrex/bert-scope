They compared their results with Khalatnikov's theory and found that it qualitatively explained the observed absorption behavior. The study confirmed the existence of a maximum absorption at around 1.5 K and provided insights into the role of second viscosity and relaxation times in the absorption process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
