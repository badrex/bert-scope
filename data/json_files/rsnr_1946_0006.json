This marked a significant change in tradition, as the society had previously excluded women from fellowship. The admission of women was supported by an overwhelming majority of fellows and aligned with the general trend of social evolution, demonstrating a commitment to gender equality in the pursuit of natural knowledge.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
