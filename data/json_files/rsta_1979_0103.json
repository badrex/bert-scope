It explores collision-induced light scattering, where molecules distort each other's electronic charge clouds, and multiple light scattering, where light is scattered more than once by isolated molecule polarizabilities. The article also examines the intensity of scattered light and its relevance to the analyses of collision-induced and multiple light scattering spectra of classical fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
