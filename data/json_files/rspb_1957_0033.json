The research shows that papillae arise during the aging process and that the adapted or mutant character can be found in both cultures derived from papillae and primary colonies. The findings suggest that colony structure, age, and colloid chemistry play a significant role in secondary colony formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
