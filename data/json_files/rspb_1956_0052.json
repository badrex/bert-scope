Observations were made during chilling, freezing, and supercooling. The results showed that some hamsters could be resuscitated after supercooling or partial freezing, with no signs of tissue damage. This research expanded understanding of hypothermia and hibernation in mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
