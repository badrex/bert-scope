The researchers found that the adhesion could be adequately explained by van der Waals forces alone, with a linear relation between experimental values and calculated van der Waals attraction for each metal-substrate pair. The adhesion showed no variation with time or film thickness, except for the thinnest films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
