They confirmed the more refrangible position of the nebular line compared to the termination line of the magnesium band using various methods, including comparing the spectra with a suitably illuminated pointer and direct vision of the two spectra. This study helped to refine the understanding of the Orion Nebula's spectral characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Nebulae and HII Regions"}
