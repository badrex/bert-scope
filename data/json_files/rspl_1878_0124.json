They found that sodic and potassic sulphates have a significant influence on the reaction, and as more sulphate is added, the reaction is accelerated. Additionally, they discovered that equal weights of sodic and potassic sulphates have nearly the same working effect, meaning their chemical equivalents are the same."}
