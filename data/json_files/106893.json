He discovered that shadows appear yellow when illuminated by candlelight and blue when illuminated by daylight. The author also found that the colors of shadows can be reversed by using colored glass to alter the light source. This research sheds light on the relationship between light, color, and shadow formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
