It derives equations governing the possible regular equilibrium paths through a point where one path is known, focusing on the local quasi-static behavior of conservative systems. The theory is applicable to any system whose potential energy depends on a finite number of variables and has implications for nonlinear elasticity and structural mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
