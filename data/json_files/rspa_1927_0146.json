They find that the calculated values are about one-eighth smaller than experimental values, but the discrepancy is likely due to the neglect of the screening effect of other electrons. The theory can be applied to beta-absorption and may be improved by considering the change of the atomic field with the electron's energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
