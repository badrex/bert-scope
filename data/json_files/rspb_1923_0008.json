They used a unique method to measure the reaction in the liquid phase, allowing them to calculate the reaction's velocity and better understand the physico-chemical behavior of hemoglobin. This research provides insight into the reaction kinetics and the role of hemoglobin in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
