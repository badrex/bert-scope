The fossils, named Palaeocoryne, have a unique structure with a dactylose base, a cylindrical stem, and a symmetrical conical body with tentacular processes. The author classifies Palaeocoryne as a member of the Hydrozoa order, specifically within the Tubularidae family and near the Eudendridae. The fossils provide valuable information about the ancient ecosystem and the evolution of these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
