The results show that after compression, the specimens tend to elongate more than undeformed specimens, while after extension, the length changes are less. These departures from normal elastic behavior are mainly due to intergranular stresses, which cause grain distortion and the opening of internal fractures. The findings have implications for understanding phenomena involving diffusion and the interpretation of experimental work in geology.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
