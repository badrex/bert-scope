They find that while surface salinity may be related to the geographical distribution of the snail, there is no clear causal relationship between salinity and morph frequencies. The author suggests that other factors with a similar geographical distribution may be at work.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
