The authors investigate the efficiency of developers, the role of reducing agents, and the relationship between density and mass of silver in photographic images. They also discuss the impact of different developers on the photographic constant and the methods used to measure and improve the accuracy of photographic development.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Dynamics in Photographic Development"}
