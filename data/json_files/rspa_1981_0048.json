The study focuses on the propagation of sound waves in thermoviscous fluids and provides expansions for the problem that are uniformly valid in the parameters space and space-time. The results are applicable to both spherical and cylindrical waves, and the article discusses various asymptotic domains and their corresponding solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
