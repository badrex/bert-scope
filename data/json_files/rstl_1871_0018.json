Roscoe and T. E. Thorpe conducted a series of measurements to determine the chemical intensity of total daylight during the solar eclipse of December 22, 1870. They found that the rate of diminution of chemical action during the first part of the eclipse was greater than the area of the darkened solar disk, while the rate of diminution in the latter part was less. The chemical intensity of the diffused light during totality was found to be negligible.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
