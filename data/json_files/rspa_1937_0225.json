They describe the different modes of sand transportation, such as suspension, saltation, and surface creep, and how these affect the final grading of the sand. The authors also discuss the impact of wind strength and the presence of different grain sizes on the sand's movement and deposition patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
