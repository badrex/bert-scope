They identified the spectral terms and ionization potentials for these elements, providing insights into the atomic structure and properties of tellurium. Their findings contribute to the understanding of atomic spectroscopy and the behavior of elements in the sixth group of the Periodic Table.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic spectroscopy"}
