He suggests that Malm may be formed by the accumulation of chalky particles around wood debris in a valley. The author also discusses his microscopical discoveries of the farina of the red lily, observing the ejection of small globules from the farinaceous bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
