Roget, explains an optical illusion that occurs when a rolling wheel is viewed through vertical apertures, such as a palisade or Venetian window-blind. The spokes of the wheel appear curved instead of straight due to the combination of the wheel's progressive and rotatory motion. This illusion occurs because the impressions made by the limited portions of the spokes on the retina leave a trace of a continuous curve line, making the spokes seem curved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
