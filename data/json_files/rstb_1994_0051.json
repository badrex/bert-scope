It highlights the significant turnover of species in response to climate change, particularly the onset of northern hemisphere glaciation. The study emphasizes that while long-term evolutionary trends in marine life were likely driven by species interactions, synchronous turnovers were closely tied to changes in climate and oceanographic conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
