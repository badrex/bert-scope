They determined the liquidus and solidus curves and studied the transformations in iron and manganese alloys. The results provide insights into the equilibrium diagrams and relative depressions of liquidus and solidus curves for solid solutions in iron and manganese alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
