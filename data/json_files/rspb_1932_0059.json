The researchers used a katharometer to measure the carbon dioxide output of individual seeds, finding that the rate of respiration increased rapidly after seeds were placed in water and then stabilized at a certain level. The findings contribute to the understanding of plant respiration and its role in seed development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
