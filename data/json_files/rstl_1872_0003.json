The coral's unique features, such as its well-developed septal apparatus and absence of endotheca, are analyzed and compared to other rugose corals, leading to the conclusion that Guynia annulata should be placed in the family of Cyathaxonidae.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
