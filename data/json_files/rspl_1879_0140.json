They propose a method to measure the specific power of producing residual charge and discuss the challenges in obtaining accurate results. The author also explores the connection between residual charge phenomena and the differential equation proposed by Professor Clerk Maxwell.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
