The stress-optical coefficients of various glass samples were measured at different temperatures and over extended periods. The results show that the stress-optical coefficient generally increases with rising temperature and that it also increases with the lapse of time. The findings suggest that the value of the stress-optical coefficient increases rapidly during the first few years after casting the glass and then stabilizes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
