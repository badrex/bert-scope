They propose a left-handed superhelical DNA structure that could be involved in the organization of DNA within the nucleosome structure in chromatin. This flexibility could also explain enhanced rates of tritium exchange and reactivity of double-stranded DNA to formaldehyde.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
