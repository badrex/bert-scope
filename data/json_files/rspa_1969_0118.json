These shear planes are chemical defects that occur when oxygen atoms are removed from the structure. The density of these planes can describe the non-stoichiometric range MoO3_x (0 < x < 0.05). The author also discusses the mechanism of production of these shear planes and compares it with other models proposed in the literature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
