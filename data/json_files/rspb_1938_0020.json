They explain the enzyme's properties and discuss its nature, including its sensitivity to KCN, H2S, NaN3, and CO. The purified enzyme has an oxidase activity 6000-7000 times greater than that of mushrooms and about 2100 times greater than the activity of the first crude extract. The active group of the enzyme is found to contain neither iron nor manganese, suggesting it may be a protein combined with copper.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
