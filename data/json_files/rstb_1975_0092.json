The fig-flora indicates a northerly and southerly element in the islands, suggesting that species of Ficus can be distributed overseas up to a certain distance. The author concludes that the New Hebrides' fig-flora did not come via the Solomons and that the sea-gap has been too wide to be crossed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
