The author extends Michell's analysis to determine the form of the highest possible wave under constant pressure at the free surface. The study includes a method of approximation for the coefficients and provides numerical examples and remarks on the values of the coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
