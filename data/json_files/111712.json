Hofmann, studied phospharsonium compounds and their reactions with monarsines. He discovered that these compounds are less stable than diphosphonium and phosphammonium series. The phospharsonium compounds can form various salts, such as dichloride, di-iodide, and platinum salts, which have interesting crystalline structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
