They calculated the oscillator strengths for vibrational transitions and found the total oscillator strength to be 0.259. The cross-sections for intermolecular collisions causing deactivation of the upper state were analyzed, and the dissociation limit was determined to be 57,140 + 20 K.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
