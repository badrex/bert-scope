The authors describe their method of using in situ hybridization with a cloned probe to Mus musculus satellite DNA to identify cells of Mus musculus origin in M. caroli chimeras. This marker system allows for a more detailed analysis of cell lineage in mammalian development and has been used in various studies, including the analysis of clonal development in the neonatal mouse liver and the study of neural cell lineages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
