The author describes the unique articulatory devices in the thorax of these trilobites, which allowed them to arch their bodies and enroll, enabling egress of the newly moulted animal. The study also discusses the challenges in recognizing and interpreting exuvial configurations in trilobite fossils.", "scientific_discipline": "Paleontology > Trilobites"}
