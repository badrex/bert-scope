The authors prove that the partition is specified by a boundary curve with a very explicit form, which includes the Johnson-Mehl construction, the common chord, and the perimeter of the larger disk. The partition rules make severe restrictions on the three-dimensional crown shapes, leading to specific crown surface equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
