The researchers found that glycerol uptake is linear with time in both light and dark conditions. Glycerol is taken up by both a transport mechanism and simple diffusion. Host homogenate decreases the net rate of glycerol uptake into zooxanthellae by diffusion in both light and dark conditions. The study provides insights into the complex relationship between coral and its symbiotic algae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
