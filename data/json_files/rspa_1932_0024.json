They used Bethe's theory to calculate the energy loss and compared it with experimental data. The results showed a discrepancy between the calculated and observed stopping power, which the authors discuss and analyze in detail. The study provides insights into the behavior of charged particles in matter and the factors affecting their energy loss.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
