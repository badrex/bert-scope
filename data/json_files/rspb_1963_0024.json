They identified the substance as uridine diphosphate (UDP) and found that it was present in much higher amounts than the previously known substance P. This discovery improved methods for measuring and identifying small quantities of active substances in tissue extracts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
