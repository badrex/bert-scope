The experiment aimed to detect any change in the direction of a light beam when traversing a magnetic field. No change in the velocity of light was observed in a magnetic field of 8000 O, either for unpolarized light or for light plane polarized at different angles to the magnetic field. The overall r.m.s. error of the investigation was 2-3 parts in 10^13, or about 70/\u00b0.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
