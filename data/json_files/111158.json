The author, Colonel Sykes, conducted hourly observations of the wet-bulb temperature and found a significant increase in the depression compared to European experiences. The study also discusses the discrepancies between different methods of determining the dew-point, such as Mr. Glaisher's factors and Dr. Apjohn's formula.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
