They found that the adsorption process follows a modified Langmuir adsorption isotherm and that the rate of adsorption is influenced by the ionic strength and nature of the electrolyte present. The study provides insights into the interaction between proteins and solid surfaces, which is important in various applications, such as food science and materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
