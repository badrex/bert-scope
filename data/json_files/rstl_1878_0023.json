The study aimed to improve the accuracy of anemometer measurements and better understand the behavior of air vortices. The author found that the anemometer's constants were influenced by various factors, such as the machine's design and the surrounding environment, which needed to be considered for accurate measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
