They find that the arrangement of molecules in the unit cell has a tetrahedral structure, and the unique oxygen atom is at the center of the tetrahedron. The authors also investigate the influence of chemical constitution on crystal structure by examining homologues like basic beryllium isobutyrate, n-butyrate, and pivalate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
