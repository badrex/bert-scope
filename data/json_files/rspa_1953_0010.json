They analyze the properties of ferromagnetic materials, such as nickel, nickel-cobalt, and nickel-copper alloys, and compare the results with experimental data. The extended model provides a better fit with experiment for various properties, including the temperature variation of specific heat and spontaneous magnetization."}
