When a person is near an electric globe, they emit a radiant light around their head, and their heart and artery movements become more noticeable. Additionally, water from an electric fountain appears to have increased luminosity and flows faster. The experiments can be enhanced by using multiple globes or tubes, and blue-colored glass globes are more effective in various weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
