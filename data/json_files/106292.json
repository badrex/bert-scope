He found that the practical theory of water and wind mills was imperfectly understood and that the conclusions of renowned authors were often incorrect. Smeaton's experiments provided a clearer understanding of the mechanics involved and helped improve the design of mills.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
