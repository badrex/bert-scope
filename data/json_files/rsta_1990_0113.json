The authors demonstrate that by selectively exciting specific vibrational states, they can control the outcome of the reactions, including the retention of excitation in the initially energized degree of freedom and the production of specific chemical bonds. This approach allows for a better understanding of intramolecular interactions and the potential for controlling chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry"}
