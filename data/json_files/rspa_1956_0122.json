The authors present a method for calculating heating rates using electronic computers and explore the relationship between temperature and absorption coefficients. They also mention the importance of high-resolution spectroscopy in understanding the behavior of minor atmospheric constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
