They found that the DNA/RNA ratio varied from about unity to more than ten, regardless of the plant species or the type of tissue present. The authors also discovered that the DNA/RNA ratio increased when plants were grown at higher temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
