He finds that the gas extracted from different minerals has slightly different densities, suggesting that helium from different sources may not be entirely homogeneous. This discovery leads to the possibility of different helium isotopes and the need for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy and Analytical Chemistry"}
