They found that mirrors with longer focal lengths provided better image quality and were more suitable for astronomical photography. The study also highlighted the challenges faced in maintaining steady motion and exposure times for accurate imaging.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astronomical instrumentation and techniques"}
