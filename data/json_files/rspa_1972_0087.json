They apply this principle to one-body, molecular, and two-electron atomic systems, demonstrating its effectiveness in calculating wavefunctions and eigenvalues. This approach provides a more flexible and accurate method for solving these types of problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
