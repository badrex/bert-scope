The study focused on measuring magnetic declination, horizontal force, and inclination. The findings include the mean westerly declination of 19\u00b06'4.4 and the mean horizontal force of 0.18455 C.G.S. unit. These measurements are essential for understanding Earth's magnetic field and its variations over time."}
