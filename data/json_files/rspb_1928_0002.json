They discovered that guanidins cause the skin to become lighter by contracting the melanophores. This action is likely due to the guanidins affecting the sympathetic nerves in the skin. Calcium salts can counteract the effects of guanidins, causing the frog's skin to return to its normal dark hue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
