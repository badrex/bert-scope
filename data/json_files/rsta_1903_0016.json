They discovered that the shape of the plate determines the figure formed, and the temperature plays a crucial role in the figure's clarity and density. The author also found that the figures are sensitive to changes in temperature and can be influenced by external heat sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
