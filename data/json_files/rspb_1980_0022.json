It found that most cells in area MT are orientation- and direction-selective, and revealed a powerful range of binocular interactions. The research provides insights into the functional specialization of the prestriate cortex in owl monkeys.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
