They found that the pressure of minimum resistance varies with the size and shape of the vessel containing the gas, suggesting that the transfer of electricity requires ponderable matter rather than ether. The authors also studied the effect of saturation with aqueous vapor on the striking distance and concluded that it remains the same in dry air and air saturated with moisture.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Electricity"}
