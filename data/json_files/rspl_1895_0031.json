They suggest that these spicules are derived from an ancient race of ferns and have evolved from a generalised stock. The spicules are formed by cells originating from the external flat epithelium of the sponge. The authors also discuss the implications of their findings on the understanding of sponge anatomy and the role of mesoderm in their development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Sponge Biology"}
