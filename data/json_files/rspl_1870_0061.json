By transfusing blood from different rabbit varieties and establishing cross-circulation between them, the author found evidence supporting the theory of Pangenesis, which could have significant implications for breeding and modifying animal varieties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Heredity"}
