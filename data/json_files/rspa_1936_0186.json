The authors used X-ray crystal analysis to determine the lattice constants and compare the mean lattice distortions at equiatomic compositions. The results show that the mean lattice spacing-composition curve is not linear, and the mean lattice distortion in concentrated solid solutions is greater than required by a linear relation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
