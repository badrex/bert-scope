The research focuses on replacing a sulfur atom with oxygen in the cephem nucleus, which results in increased antibacterial activity but also increased instability to \u03b2-lactamase. Two types of substituents are found to protect 1-oxacephem from enzymatic hydrolysis, with their protecting effects related to the types of \u03b2-lactamases derived from Gram-negative bacteria. The study leads to the development of a clinical candidate, 6059-S, with expanded antibacterial spectra against Gram-negative bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Medicinal Chemistry"}
