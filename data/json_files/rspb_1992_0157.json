They found that islet centers cluster in fractal subsets of dimension less than 3, suggesting that islet regeneration follows the same mathematical dynamics as original islet formation. This study provides a new method for understanding the geometry of pancreatic islet patterns and their role in diabetes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
