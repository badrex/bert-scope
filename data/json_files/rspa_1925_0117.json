The author describes the process of creating these compounds and their spectra, and suggests that these observations are the first direct evidence for the existence of volatile inter-metallic compounds. The study also investigates the possibility of chemical combination between magnesium and alkali metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
