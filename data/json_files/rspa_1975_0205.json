The authors analyze the problem by dividing it into four regions and solving the governing equations. The results show that the flame zone is close to the droplet surface, and the droplet experiences a thrust due to the release of mass, which can lead to drag reduction in practical situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics and Combustion"}
