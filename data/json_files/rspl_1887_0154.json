They observed seven stages before hatching and provided detailed descriptions of the skull's structure, including the olfactory capsules, turbinals, and the presence of vestigial cartilage of Jacobson's organ. This research contributes to the understanding of the morphology and evolution of archaic bird types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Ornithology"}
