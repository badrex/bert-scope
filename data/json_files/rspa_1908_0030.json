They found that the reaction is mostly first-order and that certain materials, such as glass tubes and metallic oxides, can significantly increase the rate of decomposition. The author also discovered that the presence of certain metals, like platinum, can actually decrease the reaction rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
