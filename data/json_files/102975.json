The coffin was found in a burial site and was surrounded by a strong oak wooden coffin. The bones inside the leaden coffin were surprisingly well-preserved, despite being buried for possibly 1500 years. Thoresby discusses the differences in burial practices between Roman and earlier times, as well as the condition of the coffin and its contents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeology"}
