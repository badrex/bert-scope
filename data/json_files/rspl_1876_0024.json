The authors found that selenium's electrical resistance decreases when exposed to light, and that light can generate an electric current in the material. They also discovered that the conductivity of selenium is influenced by the direction of the current and that exposure to light can cause polarization in the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optoelectronics"}
