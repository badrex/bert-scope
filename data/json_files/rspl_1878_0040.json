They explore the use of different types of guns and explosives, such as gunpowder and guncotton, to create louder and more powerful sounds that can penetrate dense fog. The author also explains the importance of the speed of the explosion and the shape of the gun in producing the best sound waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
