They discovered that each zooid contains paired luminous organs with intracellular luminescent bacteria, which emit light in response to photic or mechanical stimuli. The light emission is always preceded by ciliary arrest, and the authors suggest that this may be the basis for transmission of light emission between zooids. The study provides insights into the physiology and control of luminescence in Pyrosoma and the possible involvement of symbiotic bacteria in the light-producing cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
