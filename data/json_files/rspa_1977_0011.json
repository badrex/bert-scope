The author demonstrates that these forces can be significant and affect the anchoring of wave power devices. Experiments with models of wave rafts and submerged cylinders confirm the predicted magnitude of the force in low waves. The author also explains how breaking waves can reduce or reverse the mean force on submerged bodies, with implications for submerged reefs and sand bars.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Processes"}
