They also noticed a halo and four other segments of circles around the moon. The paraselenes had similar colors to a common parhelius, but were less vibrant. The lunar circle was particularly bright and beautiful until 9 hours. A similar lunar circle was observed in Berlin without paraselenes. This observation was made during the last solar eclipse at the Royal Observatory in Berlin.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Lunar Phenomena"}
