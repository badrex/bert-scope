Herschel, G.B. Airy, and W.H. Smyth. The telescope is found to have remarkable color dispersion and efficient aperture, making it suitable for observing nebulae and other astronomical objects. However, it is not ideal for examining bright planets due to color issues and the need for a better eyepiece design.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
