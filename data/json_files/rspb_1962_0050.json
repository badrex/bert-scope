It investigates the intercellular membranes and intracellular structures, revealing changes in cell membrane adhesion and the appearance of membrane vesicles. The research also discusses the role of genes in controlling protein synthesis and the physical forces involved in morphogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
