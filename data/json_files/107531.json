Knight, conducted experiments to understand the role of leaves in plant growth and nutrition. He discovered that leaves can continue to grow and provide nourishment to the plant even when detached from the main root system. The author also found that the fluid, which he called true sap, descends through the leaf stalks and nourishes the plant. This research sheds light on the importance of leaves in plant growth and the process of photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
