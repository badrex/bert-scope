The lice reduced feather mass, leading to increased thermal conductance and metabolic rate, as well as a steady reduction in host body mass over the course of the nine-month study. This shows that even 'benign' parasites can have indirect effects on host fitness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
