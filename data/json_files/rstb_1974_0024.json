The research focuses on the stomach ossicles, muscles, and nervous system, providing a comprehensive classification scheme for identifying homologous muscles and neurons across species. The findings can serve as a basis for consistent identification of stomatogastric motor neurons in the reptantian decapods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy and Physiology"}
