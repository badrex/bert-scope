They found that neonatal thymectomy led to severe depletion in the lymphocyte population and impaired immune response in the mature animal. Thymectomy after 3 weeks of age did not have any significant impact on the immune response. The study concluded that the thymus produces the progenitors of immunologically competent cells during early life, which mature and migrate to other sites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
