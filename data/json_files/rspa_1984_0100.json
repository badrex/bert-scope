It explores how surface irregularities affect the boundary layer-generated noise and how the intensity of the sound produced varies with the main stream velocity and boundary-layer thickness. The study also compares the theoretical predictions with experimental data, showing that the shape of the roughness noise spectrum is well modeled by the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
