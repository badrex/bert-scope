They explore the role of ATP in muscle contraction and relaxation, and how it affects the extensibility and elasticity of muscle fibers. The author also examines the similarities between muscle models and living muscle, suggesting that these models can be used to study the working cycle of muscle contraction in isolation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
