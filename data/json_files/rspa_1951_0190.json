They found that the rate of decomposition for most of the compounds was a first-order reaction, and the differences in activation energies between substituted and unsubstituted benzyl bromides were determined. The study provides evidence supporting the assumption of constant frequency factors in similar reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
