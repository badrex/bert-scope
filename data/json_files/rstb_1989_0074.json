The study focuses on the influence of changes in sexual behavior on the future course of the epidemic. The authors find that the greatest reduction in the incidence of AIDS can be achieved by changes in the rate of sexual partner change among the sexually active population, particularly those currently infected. Early behavioral changes have a more significant impact on the epidemic than changes made later on. The study emphasizes the need for better data on patterns of sexual behavior and changes therein, as well as the long and variable incubation period of AIDS and the number of individuals currently infected with HIV in the UK.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Public Health"}
