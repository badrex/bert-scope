The author, Everard Home, conducted experiments on both himself and a dog to understand the drug's mode of action. He found that the drug, when introduced into the circulation, was effective in treating gout and that its effects were similar to those of other medicines that act on the blood. Home's observations suggest that specific diseases may be caused by substances carried into the circulation and that medicines work by going through the same course before producing their effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pharmacology"}
