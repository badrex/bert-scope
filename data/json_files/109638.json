The first child could only distinguish light and colors but not shapes or distances, while the second child had some pre-existing ability to see colors and distances. The author concludes that the success of vision recovery depends on the child's previous ability to perceive colors and distances before the surgery.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
