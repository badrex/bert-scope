They introduce second-order terms to account for cases where one dimension of the cross-section is small compared to others, leading to a new form of instability. The study focuses on a thin circular tube subjected to flexure, illustrating the effects of these corrections and the potential for maximum bending moments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
