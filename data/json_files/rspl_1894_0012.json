The researchers found four main effects on respiration: diminished action, slowing and arrest of the respiratory rhythm, acceleration, and hyperinspiratory clonus. They also discovered that hyperinspiratory tonus is an important general phenomenon. The study provides valuable insights into the relationship between brain function and respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
