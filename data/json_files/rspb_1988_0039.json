The study finds that noradrenaline increases the potassium conductance of the membrane, leading to neuronal inhibition. This process involves the activation of GTP binding proteins and the opening of inwardly rectifying potassium channels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
