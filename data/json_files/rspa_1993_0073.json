They provide concrete models for the corresponding projective actions and geometric structures on the spaces of affine 3-planes, characterizing the asymptotic symmetry groups of general relativity. This approach offers a possible explanation for the observed discreteness of elementary particle spins.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry", "sub_discipline": "Differential Geometry"}
