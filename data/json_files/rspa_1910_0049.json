They found that disturbed days have larger and more irregular changes in magnetic elements, with vertical force showing the most significant differences. The author discusses the possible causes of these phenomena, including increased ionization in the upper atmosphere and variations in electric conductivity. They also suggest that magnetic storms may have a regular diurnal inequality, independent of their stage of disturbance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
