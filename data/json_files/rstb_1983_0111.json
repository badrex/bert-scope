It explores how plants perceive these transitions, with a focus on short-day plants and the role of phytochrome in sensing light-dark changes. The article also examines the significance of these transitions in the timing of reproduction and other seasonal events in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
