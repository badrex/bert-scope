They used a spectrograph and a carbon arc as a source of continuous radiation to measure the wavelengths of the principal series and observed a complicated many-lined spectrum at higher temperatures. The study provided more accurate values for the wavelengths and confirmed the predictions of Holtsmark's theory of line broadening.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
