Different exposure times to heat were tested, revealing critical periods of damage to germ cells and changes in the lipid content of Sertoli cells. The research also investigates the role of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) in recovery and the functional activity of Leydig cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
