The author analyzes the kinetic theory of gases and the velocity of agitation of ions and molecules. They consider different laws of force and discuss the distribution of velocities in various directions. The findings suggest that Maxwell's law of distribution serves as a useful approximation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas Dynamics"}
