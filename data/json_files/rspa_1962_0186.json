They demonstrated the role of barrier-layer films in determining the kinetic behavior and provided self-consistent interpretations of the Tafel slopes and e.m.f. decay observed on open-circuit. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms of electrochemical reactions at alloy electrodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
