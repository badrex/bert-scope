He discovered that the quantity of light emitted is not directly related to the degree of putrefaction and that the light-emitting substance can be separated and retained for some time. Hulme also observed that the light is a constituent principle of some bodies, like marine fishes, and can be extracted using specific chemical processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
