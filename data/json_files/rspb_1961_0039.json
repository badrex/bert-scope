They found that the capacity to produce a secondary response declined with increasing time and that the rate of antibody production was directly proportional to the size of the original inoculum of immunized cells. This research provided insights into the mechanisms of antibody production and the replication of the antibody-synthesizing mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
