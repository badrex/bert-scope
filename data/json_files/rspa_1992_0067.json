They explain the intermittent pattern of decelerating and accelerating crack growth and the transition from short to long crack regimes. The model incorporates the effects of microstructural barriers, crack tip plasticity, and hardening on crack growth rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Behavior of Materials"}
