They propose that the introduction of a scalar \"creation field\" into the theory can help explain this principle. The continuous creation of matter smooths out irregularities in the universe as it expands and reduces rotation, resulting in the observed homogeneity and isotropy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
