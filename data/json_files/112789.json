They provide a solution for a uniform conducting sphere exposed to heat from a radiant point and generalize it to handle any kind of radiation from a distance. The study shows that the effect of odd-order harmonic terms in radiation is generally nil, with the exception of the first-order term.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
