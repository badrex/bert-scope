They derive a set of partial differential equations equivalent to the gauge constraint equation and solve them explicitly for the first two orders in 2+1 dimensions. The analysis provides insights into the form of the wave functional forced by the gauge constraint equation and examines a conjecture made by Feynman for the ground state in 2+1 dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
