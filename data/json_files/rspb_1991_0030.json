The researchers found that different cell types in the small intestine have varying responses to radiation, and they developed a Morphological Index to quantify the structural damage caused by radiation. The results can potentially be used to predict tissue damage and inform treatment decisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Histology"}
