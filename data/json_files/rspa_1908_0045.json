They found that an almost constant temperature is reached when the pressure has decreased to about 150 mm. The study also shows that the velocity of the balloon decreases rapidly as the pressure approaches the limit, and the temperature remains constant up to the greatest height (around 20 kilometers) to which the balloons have ascended.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
