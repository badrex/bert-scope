They found that the system is highly polymorphic, with multiple antigens and alleles. The study also discussed the challenges in demonstrating allelomorphs and the importance of understanding the antigenic system for genetic studies and tumor transplantation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Immunology"}
