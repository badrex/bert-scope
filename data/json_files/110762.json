{"article_id": "110762", "revised_title": "Fibre: Structure, Formation, and Distribution in Animals and Plants", "semantic_tags": ["Cell Biology", "Fibers", "Tissue Structure", "Spiral Form", "Blood Corpuscles"], "tldr": "The author, Martin Barry, examines the structure and formation of fibers in both animals and plants. He observes that fibers are flat, grooved filaments found in various tissues and organs. Barry also notes the spiral form's prevalence in both animal and plant tissues and discusses the role of fibers in muscle formation. He suggests that fibers may be compound structures with the potential to form future structures through division and subdivision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
