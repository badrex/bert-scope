They used a beam of alkali metal atoms and a heavy, slow-moving molecule as a scatterer. The scattered atoms were collected using a surface ionization gauge, allowing them to measure the angular distribution of the scattered atoms. This method provided a direct experimental study of collision phenomena in gases, offering a new way to investigate intermolecular interactions."}
