Messier observed the solar eclipse from the Observatory of the Marquis of Courtenvaux, 20 degrees west of the Royal Observatory at Paris. He used a Gregorian telescope and a micrometer to measure the solar diameter and the distances of the cusps. The observations provided valuable data on the eclipse's timing and progression, contributing to the understanding of celestial mechanics and timekeeping.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
