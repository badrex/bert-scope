The results show that about 70% of ACh is contained in motor nerve terminals, 10% in intramuscular nerve fibers, and the remaining 20% in muscle fibers. About 65% of choline acetyltransferase is in motor terminals, and 35% is in nerve fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
