He discovered that the comet's body consists of solid matter and its surface is luminous. Additionally, Herschel noticed a new irregularity in Saturn's apparent figure, which he attributed to the refraction of light passing through the planet's ring.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comets and Planetary Science"}
