The mechanism involves NaCl co-transport across the basolateral membrane, accumulation in the cell above electrochemical equilibrium, a hormone-regulated permeability in the apical membrane, passive secretion through a paracellular route, and an increase in basolateral membrane permeability. Electrophysiological studies in canine trachea support this model, and the implications of the secretion model are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
