The authors develop a method to calculate the mutual electrical energy of the particles using the Debye-Huckel equation and compute the van der Waals energy. The resulting energy curves help explain various properties of the colloidal solutions, such as stability, coagulation, and flocculation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
