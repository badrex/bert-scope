Through a series of experiments, the author demonstrates that bacteria can arise de novo in certain boiled fluids, debunking the idea that they are derived from germs in the atmosphere. This finding sheds light on the understanding of putrefaction and fermentation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
