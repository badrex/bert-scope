The model couples palaeoatmospheric reconstructions, temperature, and biochemical changes to predict leaf photosynthesis. It applies the model to typical gymnosperm and angiosperm leaves, showing how changing palaeoenvironments and palaeoatmospheres affected photosynthetic rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Palaeoecology"}
