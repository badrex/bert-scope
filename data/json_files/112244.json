They discover that blood corpuscles are subject to cohesive attraction, similar to globules, and that changes in the surrounding liquid determine the ease with which this law comes into operation. The author also examines the behavior of other natural and artificial bodies, such as bubbles, cork disks, and mercury globules, to understand the underlying principles of attraction and adhesion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Blood and Circulation"}
