The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of RIA in detecting proteins in various fossils, such as mammoth, quagga, and Tasmanian wolf, and discuss the potential for this technique to clarify the phylogenies of extinct species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
