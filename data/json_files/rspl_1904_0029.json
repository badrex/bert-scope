They found that all tested minerals gave off radium emanation, with varying quantities. The author also investigated the presence of radium in the water of the King's Spring at Bath and discovered that the deposit left by the water was highly active, containing traces of radium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radioactivity"}
