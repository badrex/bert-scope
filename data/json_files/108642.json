They discovered a group of hydrocarbons resistant to certain acids and found that benzole and its homologues were formed during the process. The author also studied the brominated oil and its derivatives, providing insights into the chemical composition and reactions of the substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
