The authors derive an axisymmetric Lie-Poisson bracket and work with equations of motion in swirl-function-vortex-density form. They provide sufficient conditions for the nonlinear stability of these flows and discuss the relation of their results to linear stability studies of swirling flows. The findings have implications for meteorological and aerodynamic problems involving swirling flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
