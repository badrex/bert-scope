The compound crystallizes in the tetragonal system, with the pyrene and p-benzoquinone molecules arranged alternately in mixed stacks. This type of arrangement has not been encountered previously among tc-molecular compounds. The structure was solved by direct methods and refined to an R value of 0.048 for 778 observed reflections.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
