They measured the wave-lengths of the spectra and identified the elements present in the chromosphere, such as titanium, chromium, scandium, yttrium, iron, manganese, and zirconium. The study provides valuable insights into the composition and behavior of the sun's atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
