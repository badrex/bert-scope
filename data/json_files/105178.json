He observes that many corallines and corals are composed of tubes made by animals, with different materials and forms. He also discusses the structure and function of the curious Maltese coralline, including its slimy bag and the animals' tentaculi and feet. This species serves to illustrate the tubulary genus of corallines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
