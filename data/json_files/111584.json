The author, Arthur Cayley, provides an analytical approach to determine the double tangents and establishes an identical equation that highlights the properties of the curve of order (n-2). This equation is also important in the general theory of binary quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analytical Geometry"}
