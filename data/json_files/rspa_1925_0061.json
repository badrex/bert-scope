They argue that the surface can be composed of atoms in different degrees of saturation by neighboring metal atoms, which affects the surface's adsorptive capacity and reactivity. This concept explains the sensitivity of catalysts to heat treatment and poisoning, as well as the varying catalytic capacity of the surface atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
