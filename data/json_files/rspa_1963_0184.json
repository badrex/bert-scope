The experiments reveal that the full plastic moment of resistance agrees closely with predictions based on tension and compression test results. The upper yield stress increases with higher strain rates, making the dynamic elastic moment of resistance greater than the dynamic full plastic moment. The research also examines the influence of dynamic Bauschinger effects and residual stresses on the behavior of mild steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
