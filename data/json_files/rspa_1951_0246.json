It shows that the flow of alkali cations and phosphate anions into the cell occurs in parallel during growth or glucose oxidation. The activity of dehydrogenase and deaminase enzymes is affected by pH and ion availability. Maximum growth rates are independent of pH, but can be improved by the uptake of potassium or rubidium ions. Protective responses to adverse pH involve both ion absorption and adaptive changes during growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
