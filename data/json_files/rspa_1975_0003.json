They show that the asymptotic twistor equation leads to the alinement of frames of reference. In the absence of gravitational radiation, this alinement reduces to a parallel one. The analysis is performed in both the original space-time and the conformally rescaled manifold.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
