The reaction mechanism involves propagation reactions and chain termination by mutual destruction of radical chain carriers. This study provides insights into the oxidation of olefins and has implications for the chemistry of rubber and related materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
