The authors propose strategies to control these elements, including producing low-residual casts, increasing nickel content, reducing scaling rates, and minimizing holding times at high temperatures. They also present a revised mathematical model to predict and quantify the degree of enrichment under various reheating conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Metallurgy"}
