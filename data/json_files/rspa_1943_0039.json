They discovered hills and dales, sharp cleavage lines representing discontinuities in level, and highly uniform areas between these lines. The smallest step measured was 41 A units, and the precision attained was extremely high, particularly in the case of mica. This research provides valuable insights into the mechanism of cleavage in crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
