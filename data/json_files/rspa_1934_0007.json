The authors make detailed calculations of the dispersion for specific cases and consider the relation between oscillator strength and the intensity of absorption of radiation. They also analyze experimental data and discuss the dependence of dispersion on various factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
