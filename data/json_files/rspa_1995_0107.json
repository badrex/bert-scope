They use geodesics on quadrics to find spatial and temporal flows, which define new classes of solutions. Umbilic solitons approach a periodic wave as space tends to infinity, and they demonstrate a \"spiral\" behavior of umbilic geodesics that may be interpreted as homoclinic to periodic orbits.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
