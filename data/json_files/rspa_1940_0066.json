The author applies the findings to the problem of a ship advancing through a train of waves, discussing the average additional resistance in such circumstances. The results show that the mean pressure from second-order terms can only account for a small proportion of the observed effect, with the ship's motions and oscillations being essential factors in the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
