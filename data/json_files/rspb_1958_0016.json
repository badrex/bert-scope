They found that the erythrocyte does not follow the simple Boyle-van't Hoff law due to the rapid change in the osmotic coefficient of hemoglobin with concentration. This discrepancy affects the interpretation of osmotic behavior in living cells and the calculation of water content. The isotonic water content of erythrocytes was found to be less than the actual water content obtained by direct refractometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
