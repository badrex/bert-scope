The calf's upper jaw was divided into two halves, each with a distinct eye and nostril, and the lower jaw bent around, positioning the tongue on the forehead. The calf's brain was surprisingly small, fitting into a cavity no larger than an ordinary walnut. This unusual case offers an opportunity for further anatomical study.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
