They also report the development of a more advanced state of the fungus in a specific nutrient medium. Inoculation of various animals with the fungus resulted in a fatal disease, sometimes displaying intermittent symptoms. The presence of the characteristic organisms in the animals' blood after death supports the conclusion that the malarial fungus is pathogenic.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
