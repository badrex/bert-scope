The authors develop a technique to make the plasma membrane permeable, allowing them to study the mechanisms of secretion. They find that catecholamine release has a specific requirement for Mg-ATP and is activated by micromolar concentrations of ionized calcium. The study provides insights into the control of exocytosis and endocytosis in secretory cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
