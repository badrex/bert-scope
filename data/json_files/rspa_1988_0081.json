They represent the crack using a distribution of generalized current vortices and derive an expression for the change in coil impedance. Analytical and numerical results are provided for specific cases, demonstrating the effectiveness of the thin-plate model in predicting impedance changes in cracked components.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
