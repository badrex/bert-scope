It explores the concept of functional constraints, which limit the combinations of age-specific fertility and survival that can be achieved due to physiological or ecological factors. The article also highlights the importance of understanding trade-off functions in the environment and the use of genetic studies and experimental manipulations to detect these trade-offs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
