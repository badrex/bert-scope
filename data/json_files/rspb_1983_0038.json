They found that microtubules play a crucial role in organizing the structure of the presynaptic grid, which determines the quantal unit of transmitter release. The author also observed that microtubules direct synaptic vesicles to the active zones, where they are mobilized for release.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
