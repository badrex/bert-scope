They introduced controlled amounts of chromium carbonyl into explosive mixtures, enabling them to study relaxation effects in various gases and the rate of heat release behind detonation fronts. This method provided valuable insights into the behavior of shock waves and detonations, as well as the excitation processes in monatomic gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Shock wave physics"}
