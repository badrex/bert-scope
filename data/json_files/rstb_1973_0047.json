Blood samples were collected from 184 Kurds living in northwest Iran, and tests were conducted for various blood group systems, plasma proteins, and red cell enzymes. The gene frequencies showed a general resemblance to neighboring populations, but the Kurdish Jews had a much higher incidence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The possible reasons for this difference are discussed, including the relationship between the deficiency and resistance to malarial infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Population Genetics"}
