The stick insect's immune response includes a vigorous haemocytic reaction, where blood cells form irregular clumps around the parasite, and melanin deposition, which encases the parasite in a brittle black sheath. These reactions are more pronounced in adult stick insects compared to young nymphs. The study suggests that the stick insect's immune response is less organized and less effective than that of lepidopterous larvae, possibly due to the complexity of the host's blood composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
