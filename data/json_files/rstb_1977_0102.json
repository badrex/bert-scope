The authors analyze oceanic sediments to understand the changes in sea-surface temperature and the movement of the polar front during different intervals of time. They find that changes in sea-surface temperature can occur in a few thousand years, with average cooling or warming rates of 1-5\u00b0C/1000 years. These rates are important for understanding the ocean's response to climate change and the impact on the Earth's geologic record.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
