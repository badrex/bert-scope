The authors demonstrate that receptor coupling can improve the signal-to-noise ratio in bipolar cells, even for localized stimuli, when synapse nonlinearity is considered. This finding suggests a principle of retinal design that may compete with the requirements of high spatial resolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
