The authors explain that the largest energy required to break a specimen occurs when multiple fractures occur before final failure. They also present theoretical models to show that the crack spacing and first cracking strain depend on the area of the fibre-matrix interface per unit volume of the composite. The authors compare these models with experimental results and discuss the practical difficulties of defining first cracking strain and interfacial area. They conclude that the best way to assess the resistance to failure of the composite is by calculating the work done per unit volume in separating it into two distinct pieces.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
