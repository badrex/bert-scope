They found that at certain temperatures and pressures, gaseous mixtures of 2-methylpentane with oxygen can ignite through a two-stage combustion process involving cool flames. The authors also observed multiple and single cool flames that do not lead to ignition. They analyzed the pressure and temperature profiles of cool flames and ignition regions, providing a better understanding of the complex mechanism of gaseous oxidation of hydrocarbons."}
