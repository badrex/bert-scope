They discovered four species of rRNA in the host, with two species specific to the cyanelles. The lability of the 23S rRNA from the cyanelles and its degradation patterns suggest a possible connection to the endosymbiotic theory of cellular evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
