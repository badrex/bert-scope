The process occurs in an aqueous solution under non-alkaline conditions. The reaction products are acetaldehyde, acetic acid, and hydrogen peroxide. The mechanism involves a cyclic process where the sensitizer abstracts hydrogen from ethanol, forming a semi-quinone radical that is rapidly reconverted to the original quinone by reacting with molecular oxygen. The reaction rate depends on light intensity, oxygen pressure, and alcohol concentration. The quantum yield determination and reaction rate variation with sensitizer concentration are also studied.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
