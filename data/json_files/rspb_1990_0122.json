They treat these strategies as polygenic threshold traits, meaning they are influenced by multiple genes. The model shows that, given genetic variation in reaction norms, conditional strategies will evolve to their optimal level and be maintained by stabilizing selection. The authors test the model on three well-studied conditional strategies, including a predator-induced polymorphism in a barnacle and environmentally cued pupal color in swallowtail butterflies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
