He argues that the Earth must be extremely rigid, more so than steel, to account for the observed tidal and rotational phenomena. This rigidity supports the idea that the Earth's solid crust is much thicker than previously thought, possibly over 2000 miles thick.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
