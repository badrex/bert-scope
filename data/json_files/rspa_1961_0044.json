The authors examine the effects of friction on various materials, such as bismuth and silver nitrate, and observe the formation of wear marks, deformation twinning, and melting. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of high-speed friction and its impact on solid materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
