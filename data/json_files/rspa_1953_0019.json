They studied the reactions using a magnetic spectrometer and provided precise measurements of reaction energies. The results were compared with other research groups, revealing slight discrepancies due to differences in standards used. The study focused on reactions involving beryllium isotopes, providing insights into nuclear physics and energy cycles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
