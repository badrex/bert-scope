The research focuses on the microstructure and the role of impurities in the steel's properties. High-purity steels were found to have superior rupture life and ductility compared to commercial purity steels. The results suggest that reducing residual element content can improve ductility and increase rupture strength in these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
