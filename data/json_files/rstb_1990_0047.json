It explains how stem cells migrate to the thymus and undergo a series of T cell receptor gene rearrangements, leading to the production of mature T cells. The article also explores the involvement of growth factors like IL-2 and IL-4 in thymocyte proliferation and the mechanisms of negative selection to remove autoreactive cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
