The author, Campbell De Morgan, examines the anatomical connections between the hairs and the shell, as well as the relationship with the inner vascular and nervous layer of the integument. The findings suggest that crustacean hairs may serve as tactile organs, allowing the animals to sense their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
