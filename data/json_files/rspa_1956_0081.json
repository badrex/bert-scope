The authors analyze sea level records from various ports and find evidence of a disturbance traveling southwards from the north of the North Sea. They determine that the disturbance divides near the Lowestoft to Flushing line, with one part returning past Flushing and Esbjerg towards Bergen, and the other part traveling towards Dover. The results suggest that the disturbance has a velocity of 40 knots, which is of the right order of magnitude for a traveling wave in the North Sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
