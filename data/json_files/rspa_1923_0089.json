The study examines the bands in various conditions, such as in vacuum tubes and ammonia-oxygen flames, and discusses their possible origins and the role of nitrogen and hydrogen in their formation. The findings suggest that the Schuster bands represent the true spectrum of ammonia, while the other bands are due to different stages of ammonia molecule dissociation."}
