They used accurate computational methods and lattice models to simulate defects in the material, finding that divalent Frenkel defects are the predominant form of atomic disorder. The study also revealed that electronic disorder is more extensive than atomic processes, which has significant implications for the interpretation of thermodynamic data. The results provide a reliable basis for analyzing experimental data not only for uranium dioxide but also for other fluorite oxide phases."}
