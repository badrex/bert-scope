They found that the sparking potential decreased gradually under the action of the discharge and then increased again. The changes in sparking potential were due to permanent alterations in the nature of the electrode surface, not temporary electrical double layers. Heating the electrodes in purified argon gas modified or removed the surface layers affected by the discharge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
