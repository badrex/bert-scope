They observe differences in the structure and function of these organs, which help the birds adapt to their specific environments and diets. The study highlights the importance of understanding these adaptations for comparative anatomy and avian biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
