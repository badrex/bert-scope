He found that the formula could be adjusted to accurately account for refraction at lower zenith distances and that the difference in the obliquity of the ecliptic, as deduced from the summer and winter solstices, was due to an error in the assumed refraction values. Groombridge also noted that thermometrical corrections should be made using the outdoor temperature rather than the indoor temperature for more accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
