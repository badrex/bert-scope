The authors derive a fundamental equation and obtain Maxwell relations describing the impact of an applied electric field on the parameters characterizing surface films. They also discuss the limitations of the Bridgman, Kelvin, and Lorentz (B.K.L.) assumptions and propose new experiments to explore the effects of these assumptions on two-dimensional phase changes."}
