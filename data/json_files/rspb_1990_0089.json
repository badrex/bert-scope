By analyzing simulated and experimental single-channel currents in an identical manner, they can compare the likelihood of the experimental data being generated by a given kinetic scheme and rate constants. This method has a greater ability to distinguish among models compared to one-dimensional distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
