They explain that the wave function must satisfy certain conditions to make sense, such as ensuring no collision is taking place and the second electron is far enough away to not be disturbed by the first electron's detection. This is important for understanding and interpreting the wave equation accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
