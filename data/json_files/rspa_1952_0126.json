The author derives expressions for pressure and surface tension, demonstrating their agreement with thermodynamic quantities. The theory is applicable to macroscopic containers and provides insights into the behavior of fluids at surfaces and interfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
