He discusses the challenges in determining the numerical elements of the general theory of terrestrial magnetism due to station error, which is caused by local disturbing influences. Sabine emphasizes that both fixed observatories and magnetic travelers are affected by this error, making it a practical difficulty in the determination of the theory's elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
