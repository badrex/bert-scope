They found that the effective collision area presented by the neutral hydrogen atoms to the molecules of the resting gas remains unchanged, proving that the hydrogen atom is isotropic. This result supports the advanced symmetry of the helium atomic core and the normal hydrogen atom, as well as the isotropy of the normal sodium atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
