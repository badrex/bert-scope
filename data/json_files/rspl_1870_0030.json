The experiments involve platinum plates and mercurial surfaces, which can be charged and discharged like condensers. The author also explores the electrostatic capacity of platinum plates in dilute acid and water, and discusses the implications for underwater communication and electricity generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
