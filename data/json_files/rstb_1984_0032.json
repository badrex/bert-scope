It explores the discovery of high-lysine and low-prolamin mutants that have improved nutritional value. However, these mutants often have reduced starch content and grain yield. The article also mentions alternative approaches to improve the nutritional value of cereal proteins, such as replacing prolamin with lysine-rich storage proteins and improving the nutritional value of prolamin through genetic engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Science"}
