They develop a method to produce extremely pure oxygen and study its afterglow under various conditions. The results suggest that certain impurities, such as nitrogen and argon, play a significant role in the production of the oxygen afterglow. The author also describes the preparation and purification of various gases used in the experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas discharge phenomena"}
