The authors argue that while these models have limitations, they can still provide valuable insights into the accommodation of plate convergence within the continental lithosphere, the evolution of main orogenic loads, and the interplay between horizontal and vertical movements that control the morphology of the Himalayan ranges.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
