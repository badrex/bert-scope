They found that ocean island leads are more radiogenic than mid-ocean ridge basalt leads and that their differences can be explained by mantle differentiation and mixing. The observed chemical and isotopic heterogeneity in young volcanic rocks is considered to be a result of long-term as well as short-term mantle differentiation and mixing.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
