They demonstrate that simple models of strain heterogeneity can generate periodic behavior due to the interaction between parasite strains and host immunological defenses. Cross-immunity plays a crucial role in both bringing strains into competition and coupling the dynamics of the system. The study provides insights into understanding and managing malaria transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
