They discovered that the presence of limestone and specific atmospheric conditions, such as temperature and humidity, are crucial for the formation of saltpetre. The author also found that the presence of lime in building materials is necessary for the natural production of saltpetre.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry"}
