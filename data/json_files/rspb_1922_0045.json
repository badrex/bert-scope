They found that the time interval between the electrical response and the mechanical response was significantly longer than usual, which could be due to a prolonged latent period or a slow development of the mechanical response in the left ventricle. This finding could have implications for understanding the functioning of the heart and the development of heart block.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
