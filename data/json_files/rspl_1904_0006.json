They found that certain bucks and does tend to produce a preponderance of one sex, and that a doe resulting from prolonged inbreeding is more likely to produce female offspring. The study also suggests that the number of young in a litter may have an influence on the proportion of the sexes, with larger litters showing a predominance of one sex and smaller litters a predominance of the other.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Animal breeding"}
