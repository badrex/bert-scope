Using a galvanometer, they observed that the blood and bile had opposite electric states, suggesting that the secretion process involved a form of biological electricity. The author discusses various possible explanations for these effects, including decomposition, catalytic actions, and thermo-electric actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
