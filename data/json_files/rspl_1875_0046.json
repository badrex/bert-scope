N. Lockyer, provides evidence that the molecular grouping of calcium in the sun is nearly broken up, leading to a better understanding of the electric dissociating conditions in the sun. He also discusses the line spectra of elementary bodies and their behavior under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic physics"}
