The tables are based on the work of Aldis and are more suitable for calculations than previous tables due to their smaller interval and easier accessibility. The tables provide values of log K0 (x) for the range x = 2 to x = 12 at intervals of 0.001.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
