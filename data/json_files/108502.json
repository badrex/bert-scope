They discover a substance called excretine, which is soluble in ether and hot alcohol but insoluble in water. Excretine is found in every case of healthy human feces examined and may be one of their immediate principles. The author also discusses the possible relationship between the formation of excretine and the nature of alimentation, age, and temperament.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
