The results suggest that the major products, such as acetone and acetaldehyde, arise from the simple breakdown of a cyclic peroxide formed by adding oxygen to the olefin at the double bond. The minor products, like methyl ethyl ketone and isopropyl alcohol, are formed through different mechanisms, including hydroperoxylation and rearrangements of a biradical. This research provides further evidence for the modes of formation of the major products and helps explain the mechanisms of the minor products' formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
