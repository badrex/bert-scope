They find that energy flows perpendicularly to the plane containing electric and magnetic forces, with the amount crossing unit area per second depending on the electromotive and magnetic intensities and the angle between them. This discovery helps explain the behavior of energy in various current-carrying circuits.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
