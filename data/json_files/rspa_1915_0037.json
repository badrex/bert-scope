The authors investigated the combustion of methane with less than its own volume of oxygen in steel bombs at initial pressures between 8 and 32 atmospheres. They confirmed the \"hydroxylation\" theory of hydrocarbon combustion and determined the relative affinities of methane, hydrogen, and carbon monoxide for oxygen in flames. The authors also discussed the theoretical implications of their findings and described experiments recording whole pressure curves for various gas mixtures exploded under initial pressures of about 50 atmospheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
