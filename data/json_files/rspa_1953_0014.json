The authors discovered four stages in the explosive reaction and observed the absorption spectra of OH, CN, and other radicals throughout the process. This research provides valuable insights into the chemical kinetics of combustion and the role of free radicals in the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
