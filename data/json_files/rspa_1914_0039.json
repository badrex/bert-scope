The authors found that the presence of neutral salts, such as potassium, calcium, strontium, barium, zinc, and cadmium toluene parasulphonate, can affect the activity of toluene parasulphonic acid. The results show that the salt has a greater influence when the proportion of acid is smaller. The authors discuss the implications of these findings for the electrolytic dissociation hypothesis and the role of undissociated and dissociated molecules in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
