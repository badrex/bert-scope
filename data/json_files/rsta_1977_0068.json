It examines the source of exotic material in mare soils and suggests that these materials may be of local derivation, excavated by meteoroid impact from beneath thin mare basalt layers. The study analyzes soil samples from various lunar missions and provides insights into the evolution of the lunar regolith.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
