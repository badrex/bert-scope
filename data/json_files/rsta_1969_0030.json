Satellite", "semantic_tags": ["Infrared Astronomy", "Space Exploration", "Satellite Technology", "Celestial Mapping", "E.S.R.O."], "tldr": "The article discusses a project to map the sky in the infrared using an E.S.R.O. satellite. The satellite will scan the sky by rotating around the solar vector, allowing for a complete survey of the celestial sphere. The infrared channel will use a lead sulphide detector and will be part of the payload of the TD1 stabilized satellite. The project aims to provide a comprehensive map of the sky in the near-infrared, overcoming the limitations of ground-based observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Space Exploration"}
