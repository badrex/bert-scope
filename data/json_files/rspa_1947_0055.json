They found that gold irradiated with slow neutrons has a strong activity with a half-life of 2.7 days, which must be due to the gold isotope 198Au. The author also investigated the y-radiation properties and the / 7-spectrum, discovering only one y-ray of medium energy (0.401 MeV) following the / 7-disintegration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
