They found that the enthalpy changes can be attributed to the increase in counterion concentration in the double layers surrounding red cells in concentrated suspensions. The results also allowed the authors to estimate the enthalpy of ionization of intracellular haemoglobin in the range of 6.0 to 8.0.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
