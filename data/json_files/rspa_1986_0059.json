They find a worldwide correlation between bedload transport rates in rivers and small laboratory flumes, regardless of geology, climate, channel size, or boundary roughness. The results suggest that the transport rate decreases with increasing flow depth and grain size, providing insights into the mechanics of sediment transport and river engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
