They found that phosphates are essential for fermentation, as they increase the total fermentation amount and produce a reducing substance, which is a sugar. The results provide strong evidence that phosphates play a crucial role in alcoholic fermentation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
