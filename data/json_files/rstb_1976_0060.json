The author explains that deer can be raised on rough land and have a higher meat-to-live-weight ratio compared to sheep and cattle. Deer farming can help address protein deficiencies in human diets and provide an alternative to traditional livestock farming. However, the author notes that commercial deer farming may not be feasible in the near future due to legal restrictions on capturing wild calves and the high cost of fencing.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Sustainable Agriculture"}
