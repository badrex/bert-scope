They develop a Green dyadic representation for the source field in terms of an infinite set of multipoles, which can be related to geometrical configurations of tensor point sources. This theory is applied to calculate the excitation of the Earth's free oscillations by earthquake sources and to represent seismic sources in a multipolar form.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
