They discovered that blood and milk are made up of small globules, hair grows through the protrusion of these globules, and lice have a unique way of ingesting blood. These observations provide a deeper understanding of the microscopic world and the anatomy of living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
