Johnson's study focuses on the reciprocal influence of magnetic needles and their impact on magnetic observations. He presents a method to determine local influences affecting the needle, enabling corrections to be applied to magnetic observations. The study provides tabular results of these observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
