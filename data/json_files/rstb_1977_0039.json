The authors emphasize the importance of intercellular connections in understanding plasticity and suggest that the problem can be approached at various levels, including biochemical, behavioral, and cellular. They also mention the limitations of current knowledge and the need for further research to understand the mechanisms underlying plasticity in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
