The study found that a constant proportion of total copper content in copper-tolerant plants is bound to this complex, suggesting its role in tolerance. However, the complex's transient function indicates that it may not solely involve sequestering all excess copper.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
