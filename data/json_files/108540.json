He demonstrates the principles and practices necessary for this purpose, including the use of a galvanometer to measure the induced electric current. Faraday also explores the effects of thermo-electric currents and the influence of temperature on the instrument. His findings contribute to the understanding of electromagnetic induction and the behavior of magnetic forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
