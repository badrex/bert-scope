The authors find that certain solutions can be matched smoothly to exterior electrovac solutions involving third Painleve transcendents, and that some solutions with a force-free electromagnetic field can be matched to a particular class of electrovac metrics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
