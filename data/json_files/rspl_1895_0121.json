They found that gold diffuses at a slower rate in solid lead compared to fluid lead. The author also observed that gold can diffuse into solid silver and copper at high temperatures. The experiments provide insights into the work of Graham and the potential for measuring diffusion in solid metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
