Rostroconchs evolved from untorted univalved molluscs in the late Pre-Cambrian and remained a part of the biota until their extinction at the end of the Palaeozoic era. The article describes the features and classification of this unique class of molluscs, as well as their probable lifestyle and feeding habits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molluscs"}
