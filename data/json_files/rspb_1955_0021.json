The researchers discovered that the cuticle hardening is due to the impregnation of a lipoprotein mixture, which consists of a sterol lipoid and a protein rich in phenolic groups. These substances pass into the cuticle through different routes, with the lipoid passing through pore canals and the protein diffusing outwards. The hardening process occurs in two phases: a preparatory phase where the pre-exuvial endocuticle becomes impregnated, and a tanning phase where a quinone spreads inwards from the outer surface, making the cuticle amber-colored, hard, and resistant."}
