The author finds that the momentum of a sound pulse can be ambiguous and may not be possible to define, especially when the pulse splits into two parts due to different propagation velocities. The study also highlights the importance of considering nonlinear terms in the equations of motion for a fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
