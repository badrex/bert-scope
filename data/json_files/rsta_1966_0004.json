They found that the Gulf is a tensional feature involving the separation of the Arabian and African continental blocks and the formation of new oceanic crust between them. The central rough zone is compared to mid-ocean ridges, and the matching of pre-Miocene continental geology on either side is discussed in light of this theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
