The serum, prepared by injecting gonadotropic extracts into rabbits, prevents ovulation in rabbits and causes atrophic changes similar to those following hypophysectomy. The research also explores the differences in immunological responses to follicle-stimulating and ovulation-producing substances, providing evidence for their separate identities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
