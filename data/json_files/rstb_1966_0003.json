The researchers found that acute hemorrhage led to a significant increase in aldosterone secretion in some dogs, while others showed no response. Factors such as surgical stress, low dietary sodium intake, and adrenal medullary hormones played a role in the response. The role of ACTH and renin as mediators of the action of hemorrhage on aldosterone secretion is further explored in part II.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
