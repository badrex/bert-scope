They derive and compare potential energy profiles to identify the rate-determining step in the deposition process. The study highlights the effects of ion transfer, surface diffusion, and lattice building on the mechanism and kinetics of metal deposition, providing insights into the behavior of copper, nickel, and silver deposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
