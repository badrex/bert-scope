They propose that the heart may have an internal antagonist system, similar to voluntary muscles, which could explain its contraction and dilation. Langrish also suggests that the nervous ether may play a role in the heart's function and that the heart's structure may be an epitome of muscular construction in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
