The formation of wrinkle lines in the membrane is studied, and solutions are given for several simple cases. The wrinkle lines are found to satisfy the one-dimensional diffusion equation, leading to analogies with heat flow through a slab.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomechanics"}
