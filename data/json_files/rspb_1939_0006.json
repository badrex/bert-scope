They discovered that virus inclusions can be removed intact from infected cells by using a suitable mounting medium with the right osmotic pressure. The study also found that virus content in the cells is not confined to inclusions, but is also dispersed throughout the cytoplasm. The authors also examined the properties of infected cells, including their virus content, and the stability of virus inclusions in different media.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
