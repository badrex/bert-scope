The authors describe the necessary conditions for chaos in electronic circuits and demonstrate how chaotic behavior can be observed through experimental manifestations, such as the double-scroll Chua attractor and the stretching and folding mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electronics"}
