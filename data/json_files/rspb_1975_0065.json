They emphasize the importance of understanding the chemistry and microbiology of sediments to comprehend the fate of pollutants in the marine environment. The recognition of organic pollutants in aquatic sediments is crucial for distinguishing them from natural compounds and understanding the impact of human activities on the environment. Various analytical techniques, including computerized gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, are employed to identify pollutants and natural compounds in aquatic sediments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry"}
