He explains that by reducing the temperature, chemical actions in the body are slowed, leading to imperfect combustion and the production of sugar in the urine. The experiments conducted on rabbits demonstrate the effects of cold on the body and the presence of sugar in the urine after the application of cold.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
