The author describes the preparation of polymercury cations and the formation of insoluble golden metallic compounds. The structures of these compounds are analyzed, revealing non-stoichiometric and stoichiometric properties. The transformation of chain and layer compounds is also discussed, highlighting their remarkable electronic and structural properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
