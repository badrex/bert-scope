The new approach allows for the incorporation of crystal field effects, isotropic and anisotropic exchange, and non-collinear exchange within a three-dimensional framework. The theory covers various effective field models, including the Neel model of ferrimagnetism and the generalized molecular field model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
