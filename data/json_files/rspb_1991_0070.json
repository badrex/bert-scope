Using eigenvalue sensitivity analysis, the study revealed that oxidative phosphorylation has minimal sensitivity and highest buffering capacity at a specific degree of coupling, which aligns with the optimal efficiency of ATP production in living cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
