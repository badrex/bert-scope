The wave field consists of a breaker followed by a train of lower, non-breaking waves. Measurements of surface height profiles, vertical distribution of mean horizontal velocity in the wake, and vertical thickness of the wake were made, supporting the hypothesis that the breaking region imparts a shearing force along the forward slope equal to the component of its weight in that direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
