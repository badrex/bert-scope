This small creature, found attached to the eyes of sprats, has a unique proboscis or snout that spreads at its end with an aperture. The snout has knobs on the sides, allowing it to be fixed to the fish's eye. The Eye-sucker's body is green, and it has a pair of small black eyes and a couple of holes, possibly its nostrils. Baker hopes for more accurate descriptions from observers who encounter the creature alive.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Invertebrate Zoology"}
