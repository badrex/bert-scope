The biomass of other major groups of organisms is not as high and may be exceeded by organisms in temperate waters. The specific composition of the open water community is dominated by blue-green algae and three herbivores that use them as a food source. The distribution and species composition of the benthos are determined primarily by the nature of the substrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
