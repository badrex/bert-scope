The authors found that both diffusion and chemical reaction velocity play a significant role in the process. They also concluded that the rate of uptake is slower in intact corpuscles compared to hemoglobin solutions. This research has implications for understanding oxygen acquisition in the lungs and oxygen unloading in tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
