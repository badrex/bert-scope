The authors observe that granules in the glands decrease during digestion, and they propose that these granules are stored-up cell products that, upon molecular rearrangement, produce substances including the proteid ferment, pepsin. The study provides insights into the functioning of the gastrointestinal system and the role of granules in gland secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Gastrointestinal system"}
