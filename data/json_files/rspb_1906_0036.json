The author, C.S. Sherrington, observes that the reflex involves rhythmic flexion and extension of the limbs and is influenced by both peripheral and central factors. The tail stimulus inhibits the reflex, leading to an after-increase in activity when the inhibition is removed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
