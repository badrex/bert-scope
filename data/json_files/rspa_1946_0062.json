The research focuses on the formation of sand ripples and water vortices, which play a significant role in the loss of energy of traveling water waves. The experiments provide quantitative data on the size and character of sand ripples, the drag they create, and the minimum oscillating water motion required to disturb the sand. The findings can help improve the prediction of foreshore movements in maritime engineering projects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
