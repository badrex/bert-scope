The experiment used a large scintillation detector placed deep in a South African gold mine to study atmospheric neutrinos and their interactions. The motivation for this research includes probing the structure of the weak interaction and searching for extraterrestrial neutrino sources. The experiment provided clear examples of atmospheric neutrino interactions, but further improvements in angular and spatial resolution are needed to answer remaining questions about the nature of the events observed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
