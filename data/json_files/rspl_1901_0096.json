They create a dispersion tube to study the phenomenon and observe a complete anomalous spectrum with all colors between red and violet, except for a range of about twenty Angstrom units at the D lines. The author also studies the physical behavior of the metallic vapour and its connection to the optical behavior of the medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
