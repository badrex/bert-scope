They argue that dentine formation is more closely related to bone formation than previously thought, and provide evidence for the incellular nature of the dentine matrix. The author also discusses various theories on dentine development and compares their findings with existing theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Histology"}
