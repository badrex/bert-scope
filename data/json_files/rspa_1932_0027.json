A. Guggenheim and R. H. Fowler discuss the laws of dilute and perfect solutions using thermodynamic reasoning and statistical mechanics. They focus on the mole-fraction scale of concentration and the additivity of energies and volumes on mixing. The authors also explore the relationships between thermodynamic functions and the properties of perfect gases and liquid phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
