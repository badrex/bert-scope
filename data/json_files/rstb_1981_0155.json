The mechanism involves a diffusing morphogen and a biochemically plausible gene or color-specific enzyme activation switch process. The model is applied to various experiments and demonstrates the important roles of geometry and scale on the spatial patterns obtained. The results are compared with patterns on specific animals like the Felidae, zebra, and giraffe.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
