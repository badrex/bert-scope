They found that both helper and suppressor T cells recognize the 211-222 stretch of the LDH-B sequence, but have different fine specificities. This finding supports two possible mechanisms of suppression: bridging of helper and suppressor T cells by antigen and subsequent transmission of a suppressive signal, or competition for antigen between helper and suppressor T cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Immunology > T cell regulation"}
