He explains the advantages of using sulfur carbide as a lens material, which allows for a more compact telescope design and improved performance. Barlow believes that with proper assistance, he can create a telescope with a two-foot aperture and 24 feet in length, surpassing the capabilities of current telescopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Telescope design"}
