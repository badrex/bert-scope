They found that the cross-section reaches a maximum of 50 at an energy of 14 electronvolts and provided a function to represent the cross-section. The results agree well with theoretical calculations based on the Bethe-Born approximation. This research is important for understanding the destruction of hydrogen in local thermodynamic equilibrium and the properties of arc plasmas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
