The research reveals slower conduction velocity, prolonged refractory period, and increased temperature sensitivity in the mutant mice compared to controls. The findings suggest that alterations in the motor axons can account for the failures in neuromuscular transmission observed in the med mutation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuromuscular Biology"}
