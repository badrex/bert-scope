The authors develop a solution using an extended Stroh formalism and calculate the energy change as a flat interface evolves into a slightly wavy cosine profile. The study aims to gain insight into minimizing or eliminating undesirable flaw processes in piezoelectric and dielectric thin films.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
