The unique bundle divertor prototype demonstrates improved containment and reduced impurities, while neutral injection heating delivers power to the plasma, enhancing containment time and performance. These findings contribute to the development of future fusion reactors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
