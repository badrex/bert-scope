They extend earlier work by Dewey, which was restricted to flows with spherical symmetry and only one shock wave. The method requires knowledge of individual air element trajectories and the Lagrangian form of the equation of continuity to calculate density. The theory is applied to an explosion of 479 kg of TNT placed near the ground, and the results are compared with pressure transducer data, showing good correlation. The authors conclude that the proposed theory is valid and applicable to situations with significant gasdynamic effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas Dynamics"}
