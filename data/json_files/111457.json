Matthiessen, conducted experiments on the reaction of nitrous acid on aniline and found that phenylic alcohol is converted into nitrophenassic acid due to the presence of free nitric acid. The author also tried the action of nitrous acid on other organic bases, such as ethylaniline, and observed a base that appeared to be ethylamin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
