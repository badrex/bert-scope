The author shows that in the absence of electron exchange, matrix elements of the interaction between subsystems can be accurately expressed as electrostatic repulsion energies between electric distributions localized on subsystems. This concept simplifies the problem of weak interactions and provides a general understanding of phenomena such as quasi-classical forces, inductive interactions, dispersion forces, and resonance forces."}
