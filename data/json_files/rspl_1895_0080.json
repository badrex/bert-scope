They discovered that the spleen responds to changes in blood pressure and can contract independently of the central nervous system. The spleen's contractions can be influenced by certain drugs and animal extracts, such as curare, suprarenal extract, and brain extract. The study also found that the spleen's response to dyspnea is of central origin and that both the right and left splanchnic nerves contain fibers that cause contraction and dilatation of the organ.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
