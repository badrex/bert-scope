The authors discuss the limitations of classical mechanical theories and propose a new approach to understanding the behavior of high explosives. They develop a method to test the sensitivity of explosive compositions using fall hammer tests and analyze the results to gain insights into the factors contributing to detonation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
