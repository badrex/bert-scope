It explores the conditions for beam power and energy requirements, limitations of the beams, and the interactions between the beams and the plasma. The article also describes the creation of a beam-driven current, which may enable the development of continuously operated tokamak reactors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
