It shows that much of the water in the glue is extracted from the air, and the ingestion of the web forms a significant contribution to the spider's daily water intake. The adhesive properties of the capture thread are enhanced by droplet formation, and the timing of web building maximizes water absorption, enhancing the effectiveness of the glue in prey capture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology"}
