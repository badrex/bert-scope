The author examines the effects of mechanical stress, electric fields, and magnetic fields on double refraction in artificial and natural crystals. They explore the possibility of considering double refraction as due to an anisotropic distribution of similar particles and discuss the differences in dispersion occurring in different directions in a doubly refracting medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
