The main activity during boring consists of a cyclical repetition of movements called the boring cycle. Each cycle involves the retraction of the shell, abrasion of the burrow walls, and slight rotations of the animal. The study uses various techniques to analyze the movements and pressures involved in the boring process, providing insights into the mechanics of boring in bivalves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
