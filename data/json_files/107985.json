He compares the effects of electricities on tension, evolution of heat, magnetism, chemical decomposition, physiological phenomena, and sparks. Faraday's experiments provide evidence for the identity of voltaic and common electricities and contribute to the understanding of their properties and applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
