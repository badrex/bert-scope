The author argues that Latimeria, a coelacanth, is more closely related to bony fishes rather than chondrichthyans based on the analysis of various character complexes and physiological similarities. The widespread occurrence of urea retention in different species challenges the use of this trait as evidence for a coelacanth-chondrichthyan link.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Evolution"}
