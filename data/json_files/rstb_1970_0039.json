The plant beds, dating back 42,000 years, provide insight into the climate and vegetation of the time. The area experienced a severely cold climate with permafrost, and the plant mixtures indicate a landscape with open habitats and warm summers with very cold winters. The findings contribute to our understanding of the Weichselian period and the effects of climate change on plant life.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
