They found that cavitation sets in at a rarefaction of about 2 atm for castor and paraffin oils, consistent with hydrodynamical theory. The results provide insights into industrial processes involving liquid films and roller technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
