The author suggests that these reactions, such as chain-branching radical reactions, have a more rapid rate of increase with temperature compared to reactions between whole molecules. This can lead to a build-up of active centers during the temperature rise in the pre-ignition zone of a flame front, making them important in understanding combustion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
