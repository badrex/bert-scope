The author, E. Brown-S\u00e9quard, highlights various points of resemblance, such as increased sensitivity, muscle contractions, and blood vessel contractility. The author suggests that these similarities are due to a paralysis of vascular nerves and an increase in blood flow, leading to enhanced vital properties of nerves, muscles, and blood vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
