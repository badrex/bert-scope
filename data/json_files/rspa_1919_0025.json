They found that particles with a smaller size experience more Brownian movement, which prevents them from settling due to gravity. By applying an electric field, the particles are dragged up or down, and their settling can be measured, providing a way to determine their size.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal chemistry"}
