He updates his previous paper with new information from Major Strachey's work on the physical geography of the Himalayas. The author finds that the mean height of the table-land was underestimated, and the northern deflections caused by the attraction of the table-land alone are provided. The errors produced in the astronomical amplitudes are significant and cannot be ignored in geodetic calculations or mapping the country with precision.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
