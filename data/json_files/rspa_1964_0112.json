The transformation is rapid and reversible, and is generally accompanied by twinning on (100) and {110} planes. The orientation relations between the two phases and the shape change accompanying transformation have been determined. Twinning shears have also been measured, and stacking faults and dislocations are present in both phases. Cracks occur in the films on transformation from the tetragonal to the monoclinic phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
