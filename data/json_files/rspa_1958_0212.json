They use Moszkowski's relativistic modification of the Born approximation to obtain an expression for the cross-section and calculate cross-sections for elements with atomic numbers less than 30. The results show good agreement with experimental data and demonstrate the importance of considering relativistic effects in high-energy electron interactions with atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
