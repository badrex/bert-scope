They found that the rate-controlling step in the graphitization of diamond surfaces is the detachment of a single carbon atom, which requires an activation energy of 3.5 eV for {111} surfaces and 2.5 eV for {110} surfaces. This low activation volume supports the single-atom process involved in graphitization.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Material Transformation"}
