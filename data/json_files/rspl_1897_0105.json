They employed a modified Nernst bridge and an experimental condenser to measure the dielectric constants of substances such as ethylic alcohol, amyl alcohol, and ethylic ether. The results showed that the dielectric constants of these substances varied at different temperatures, providing insights into their properties at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
