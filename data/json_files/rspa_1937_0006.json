They explore the influence of charged and uncharged substituents on the dissociation constants and provide a theoretical approach to calculate molecular dimensions of amino acids. The study highlights the importance of understanding the chain effect and charge effect on the ionization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
