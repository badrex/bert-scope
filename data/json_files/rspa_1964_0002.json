They apply the Wheeler-Feynman absorber theory to expanding cosmological models and find that the refractive index plays a crucial role in resolving ambiguities related to the sign of the imaginary part. The study reveals that full retarded solutions are consistent in steady-state cosmology, while full advanced solutions are consistent in Einstein-de Sitter cosmology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
