They found that the viscosity of carbon dioxide increases more rapidly with temperature than expected, indicating a change in the field of force between the gas molecules. This change is demonstrated by a point of singularity in the graph of viscosity against temperature, suggesting a shift in molecular hardness. The results provide evidence that carbon dioxide molecules can be considered as point centers of repulsive force with a change in the order of the repulsive force at a specific temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
