They derive a formula for determining the resonant note and discuss various cases, including openings, cylindrical necks, and tubes of revolution. The authors also describe experiments comparing their formula with observations, resulting in a satisfactory agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
