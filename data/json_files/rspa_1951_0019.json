They show that the Volta-Helmholz hypothesis, which explains the separation charging, is related to the contact potential and is affected by surface topography. By incorporating the tunnel effect, a precise quantum-mechanical theory is derived, which agrees with experimental results within the limits of error.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
