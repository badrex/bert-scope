The authors examine the characteristics of transitional forms and the possible ancestry of various organelles, focusing on the similarities between mitochondria and aerobic bacteria and the differences between different types of chloroplasts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
