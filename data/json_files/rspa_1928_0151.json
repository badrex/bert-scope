They discovered that the nitrogen exhibited luminescence, producing a bright yellow-green glow. The spectrum of the luminescence was analyzed, revealing distinct series of bands in the visible and ultraviolet regions. The authors also observed phosphorescence and determined the upper temperature limit for the luminescence to be between the temperatures of liquefaction of hydrogen and melting of nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
