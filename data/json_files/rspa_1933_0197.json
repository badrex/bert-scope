The study reveals that the center-to-center distance in the benzene ring is about 1.41 \u00c5, and the center of the methyl group lies at a slightly greater distance. The findings show that the long axis of the naphthalene molecule is tilted further out of the (010) plane than that of anthracene. The structure factors for all planes were calculated, and the structure has been refined using Fourier analysis. The results provide insights into the arrangement and density of atoms within the naphthalene crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
