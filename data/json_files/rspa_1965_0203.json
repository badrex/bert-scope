The author discusses the properties of baryons and mesons, and how non-compact symmetry groups can be used to describe their behavior and predict new particles. The study of non-compact groups offers a new perspective on the theory of charge independence and the assignment of particles to multiplets.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
