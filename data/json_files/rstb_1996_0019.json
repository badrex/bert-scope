These enzymes are involved in various cellular functions, including protein sorting and cell surface receptor signal complexes. The study analyzes the relationships between PI3-kinases, PI4-kinases, and PI5-kinases, as well as their subgroups, based on their structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
