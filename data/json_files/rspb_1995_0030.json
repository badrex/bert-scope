This preference is independent of size, overt aggression, and familiarity with other fish. The ability to recognize and prefer poor competitors may explain the distribution of animals in foraging groups according to the Ideal Free Distribution, despite the violation of its key assumption of equal competitive abilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
