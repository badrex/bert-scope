The author investigates Taylor-vortex flows between cylinders of varying lengths and reports observations on primary and secondary modes. The study confirms the existence of hysteresis phenomena and discovers two novel secondary modes featuring three and four cells spiraling in opposite directions. The findings contribute to a better understanding of fluid dynamics and bifurcation theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
