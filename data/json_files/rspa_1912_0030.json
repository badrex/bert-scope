They found that the emission of negative electricity from hot carbon at atmospheric pressure had not been previously investigated. The authors discovered that the current-voltage curves for carbon rod electrodes increased exponentially with temperature, and the effective resistance of the gap between the electrodes increased with the distance between them. This research contributed to the understanding of high-temperature phenomena and the development of electric furnace technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermoelectricity"}
