The study reveals that new mRNAs accumulate during the mature green stage, stimulated by ethylene. The regulation of gene expression and the mechanism of ethylene action are discussed, focusing on the identification of cDNA clones for the cell wall softening enzyme polygalacturonase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
