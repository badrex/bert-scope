He observed that some liquids, like alum water, hindered growth, while others, like urine, seemed to help. The author also noticed that some plants grew better when planted at a certain distance from each other, suggesting that soil fertility and spacing play a role in plant growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
