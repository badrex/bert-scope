The authors analyze the earthquake's intensity, the direction of the fault, and the relationship between the sound and shock. They conclude that the earthquake was most likely caused by a slip in the Charnwood Forest fault, which supports the idea that the fault played a significant role in the earthquake.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
