They found that the absorption spectra of some crystalline and oriented solids change when the direction of orientation of the crystals is altered in relation to the direction of vibration of the electric vector in the polarized incident beam. This method can be used as an adjunct to crystal analysis by X-rays, helping in the assignment of molecular vibration frequencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
