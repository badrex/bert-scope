They consider the local polarization field acting on a molecule to be dependent on its orientation with respect to the external field, leading to a modification of the Kerr constant. This new theory explains the deviation of Langevin's theory from observation in the Kerr effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
