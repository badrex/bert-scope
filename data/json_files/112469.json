The observations reveal changes in the nebula over time and provide details on its resolvability, with the presence of many minute stars and the absence of a continuous spectrum. The study contributes to the understanding of the Orion Nebula and its evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
