It focuses on the adhesion or galling mechanism, which is responsible for friction and wear. The authors found that the volume of material worn away is proportional to the load and the distance traveled, and directly proportional to the true area of contact. They also discovered that a large increase in wear rate occurs at higher loads due to the self-accelerating process of loose wear particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
