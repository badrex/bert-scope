It explores the properties of specialized cells called transfer cells and their role in ion transport. The author also examines the mechanisms of ion transport in giant algal cells, which may serve as a model for higher plant cells. The article highlights the importance of understanding ion movement within individual plant cells to study ion transport in plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
