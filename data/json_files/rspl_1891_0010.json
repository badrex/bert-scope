They study the nature of the lead salt formed during discharge, the effect of electrolyte on the cell's performance, and the role of peroxides in the cell's behavior. The author concludes that improvements in the cell's efficiency can be achieved by focusing on the electrolyte and the chemical changes occurring within it."}
