The gravity-sensing mechanism involves the sedimentation of amyloplasts in specialized cells, while the light-sensing mechanism is more complex and interacts with the gravity-sensing system. The article highlights the challenges of studying these mechanisms and the potential for future research in a zero-gravity environment like Spacelab.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
