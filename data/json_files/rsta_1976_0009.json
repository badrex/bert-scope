The three main events in the evolution of the Grenville Province are the emplacement of anorthosite suite rocks around 1450-1500 million years ago, rifting associated with the opening of a proto-Atlantic ocean between 1200 and 1300 million years ago, and continental collision responsible for the Grenvillian orogeny around 1100-1000 million years ago.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
