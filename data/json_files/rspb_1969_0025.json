It covers the discovery of the role of ferredoxin as an electron carrier, the involvement of hydrogen metabolism, and the enzymic system responsible for nitrogen fixation. The author also presents a reaction series for nitrogen fixation and discusses questions and challenges related to the purification and function of the enzyme constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
