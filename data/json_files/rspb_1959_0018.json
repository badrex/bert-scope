The researchers found that the enzyme is capable of synthesizing acetylcholine at a rate of 300 \u00b5g/g/h. They also discovered that the enzyme is stable within the environmental temperature range of Mytilus, but is rapidly inactivated at higher temperatures. This finding is important for understanding the physiology and control of ciliary movement in these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
