Matthiessen, conducted a study on the specific gravities of various alloys and their expansion on cooling. The alloys tested included antimony, tin, cadmium, bismuth, silver, lead, mercury, and gold. The results showed that some alloys, such as bismuth-antimony, bismuth-gold, and bismuth-silver, expanded greatly on cooling, while others expanded very slightly or not at all. The study aimed to provide a preliminary step for further research into the electric conductivity of alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
