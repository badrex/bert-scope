The authors found that the yolk-sac and allantois have an active metabolism and contribute significantly to the overall metabolic rate of the developing chick embryo. The study provides a more accurate understanding of the role of extra-embryonic membranes in the metabolic life of the developing egg.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
