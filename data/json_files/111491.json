He demonstrates that certain relations exist among the roots of these squares, which can be applied to even numbers as well. Pollock also shows that these properties can be connected to arithmetic series and suggests a possible link to Fermat's theorem on polygonal numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
