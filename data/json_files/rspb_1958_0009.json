They examine the mechanism behind this correlation and suggest that fluctuations in the Arctic Front cause changes in the strength of the current system in the Norwegian Sea. The study also shows an association between the southerly wind component and the year-class strength of the Bear Island cod, linking the strength of the West Spitsbergen Current to the transportation of larvae from the Lofoten spawning grounds to the Bear Island nursery grounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
