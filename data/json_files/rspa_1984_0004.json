The compressible Navier-Stokes equations were solved numerically, including a vibrational-relaxation equation for oxygen. The results show that the rise times of weak spherical shock waves are affected by two factors: the -wave effect and the non-stationary effect. These factors influence the wave's overpressure and half-duration, which are essential for understanding sonic booms and explosions in air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
