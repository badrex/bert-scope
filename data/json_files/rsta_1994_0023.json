They also observed nanometric defect structures and resolved the cage morphology of buckyballs in the finest details. This research provides insights into the molecular lattice structure and atomic morphology of C60 films, which can be useful for understanding their physical and chemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nanotechnology"}
