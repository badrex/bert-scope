They observed the germination process and the root hair stages of the fungus in Brassica rapa seedling roots. The findings suggest a complete life history for the organism, including nuclear fusion in the secondary phase, which helps in understanding the development of clubroot disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
