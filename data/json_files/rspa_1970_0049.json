They compared their findings with predictions based on the work of Simons and Maris, which takes into account the finite lifetime of thermal phonons interacting with ultrasonic phonons. The results show that the observed attenuation is generally acceptable, considering the simplicity of the theoretical model used. Further experiments are suggested to identify the individual processes responsible for the attenuation and to provide information about the lifetime of specific thermal modes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
