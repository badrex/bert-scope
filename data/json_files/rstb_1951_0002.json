They discovered that the position of a new leaf depends on a balance between inhibitory influences from existing leaf centers. The study provides insights into the differences in leaf localization mechanisms between monocotyledons and dicotyledons, supporting Richards' theory of phyllotaxis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
