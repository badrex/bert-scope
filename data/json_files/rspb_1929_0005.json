They demonstrate that the corpus luteum is responsible for the oestrus-inhibiting activity during lactation and that it plays a crucial role in pseudo-pregnancy. The study also explores the effects of anterior pituitary extracts on the ovary and the possible presence of two distinct factors regulating ovarian activity in the anterior pituitary body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
