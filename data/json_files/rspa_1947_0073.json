They propose an empirical formula for lateral diffusivity, which, when combined with existing expressions for normal diffusivity and wind speed, provides a practical model for the lower atmosphere. This model helps estimate the effects of neglecting lateral dispersion and offers a comparison with experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
