Norman Lockyer, discusses his research on spectrum-analysis in connection with the sun's spectrum. He explores the new method of spectroscopic observation and its potential for quantitative analysis. Lockyer also investigates the absorption spectra of metalloids and searches for other elements in the sun. He presents his findings on the disappearance of lines in the spectrum as the percentage of the element decreases and the effect of one element on the lines of another.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
