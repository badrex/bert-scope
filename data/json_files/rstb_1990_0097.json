They discuss how the endogenous body clock and exogenous factors, such as sleep and meal timing, influence performance over the course of a day. The study highlights the importance of understanding these rhythms to improve safety and productivity, especially for shift workers.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Human Factors"}
