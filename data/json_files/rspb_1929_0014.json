They found that the differences in microscopical and macroscopical structure of muscles with varying contractile properties are associated with the presence of two types of muscle fibers: granular (red) and clear (white) fibers. These fiber types are found in various species and are linked to the speed of muscle contraction and fatigue resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
