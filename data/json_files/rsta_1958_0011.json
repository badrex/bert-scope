They develop a theory based on calculating the probability of a polarized photon being emitted by the atom-electron system and compare their theoretical predictions with experimental results. The authors find that the polarization observed in some cases cannot be explained by the reactions considered, and further experimental work is recommended.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
