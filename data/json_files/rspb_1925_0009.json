They discovered that the twitch's flat top and sharp angle are influenced by factors such as temperature, circulation, and muscle freshness. The study also found that the shape of the twitch is determined by internal friction and viscosity within the muscle, and that a muscle with no internal friction would have a rectangular shape.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
