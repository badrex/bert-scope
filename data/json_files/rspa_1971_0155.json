They observed the formation of anions and cations in the glass and investigated their reactions with alcohol molecules. The authors found that the anions of naphthalene and diphenyl have different reactivities towards alcohols, leading to different products and decay rates. The study provides insights into the behavior of aromatic hydrocarbons in alcohol glasses under irradiation."}
