They provide evidence that the sheath is present in human teeth and plays a crucial role in determining the limits of dentine deposition. The study also clarifies the origin and function of the epithelial layers in Nasmyth's membrane.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Developmental Biology"}
