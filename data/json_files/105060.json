He observes the structure and use of muscles, the role of blood vessels and nerves, and the difference between voluntary and involuntary motion. He concludes that the will has a direct power to heighten and increase the sensation of nerves, which leads to muscle contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
