Black Beauty", "semantic_tags": ["'Chromosome Condensation'", "'Lilium Hybrid'", "'Preleptotene Stage'", "'Meiosis'", "'Plant Biology'"], "tldr": "The study investigates the preleptotene chromosome condensation stage in Lilium hybrid cv. Black Beauty, estimating its duration to be about 1.16 days in pollen mother cells and 0.7 days in embryo sac mother cells. The research concludes that this stage has no significant function and may represent a mitotic reversion in the process of meiosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
