Through these experiments, he discovered a new acid called nitropopulic acid. The author provides detailed instructions on how to extract and purify nitropopulic acid, as well as its properties and reactions with other chemicals. This research sheds light on the chemical composition of plants and the potential applications of nitropopulic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
