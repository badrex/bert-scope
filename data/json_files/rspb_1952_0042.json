They fed bees with syrup containing radioactive phosphorus and observed the distribution of radioactivity among the bees and larvae. The results showed widespread food transmission, suggesting it as the foundation of the division of labor and the unique odor produced by colony members for mutual recognition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
