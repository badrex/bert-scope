They demonstrate that the spatial modulation of the dielectric constant can be expressed in terms of simple convolution integrals involving the input pulse shape, steady-state scattering spectrum, and frequency shift between the laser and scattered beams. This approach allows for the calculation of the amplification coefficient and the modulation's amplitude and phase, providing a better understanding of non-steady-state scattering processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Laser Physics"}
