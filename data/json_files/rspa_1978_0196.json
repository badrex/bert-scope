The instability leads to the emission of scalar, electromagnetic, and gravitational radiation from the star. The authors calculate eigenfrequencies for stable and unstable modes of a scalar field on a background metric with an ergoregion and find that unstable modes exist for all stars, but with a folding time that is several orders of magnitude longer than the age of the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
