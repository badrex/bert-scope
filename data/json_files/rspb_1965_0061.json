The research found that the protein concentration and composition of these fluids change during the 20- to 28-day gestational period. The study also reveals a paucity of lipoproteins and a-1-and a-2-macroglobulins in the foetal fluids, and suggests that the paraplacental chorion is the major site for the passage of proteins to the foetal fluids other than the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
