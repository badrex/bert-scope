The research uses hourly mean values of geomagnetic elements from 1957.5 to 1960.0, and it separates the ocean dynamo effect from the remaining geomagnetic lunar daily variation. The findings provide insights into the ionospheric dynamo and its associated induced currents, as well as the internal and external current systems related to the ionospheric dynamo effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
