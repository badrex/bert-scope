They explain how small variations in current are proportional to the temperature of the conductor, and describe methods for determining the value of a diagram in webers or other units of current. The thin conductor can be used to limit the amount of electricity flowing through a circuit or to produce a record of the current passed through a circuit over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
