The authors describe experiments that demonstrate how thermal expansion and wear can lead to thermoelastic instabilities, causing load to be concentrated into small areas on the surface. The authors provide an analysis of this instability and find a good correlation with experimental observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
