The machine works by allowing water to flow through a funnel and into a pipe, creating a high-velocity stream that mixes with air and forms a froth. This froth is then forced out of the pipe, creating a powerful blast. The machine can be used for smelting ore and is also useful for conveying fresh air in industrial works.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Industrial engineering"}
