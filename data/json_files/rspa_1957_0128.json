The authors describe their method for measuring the structures with high accuracy and discuss the causes of systematic errors in interferometric measurements. They also explain the use of a double etalon to improve the resolving power and reduce errors. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the properties of indium isotopes and the development of atomic spectroscopy techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
