He achieved this by reacting iodide of allyle with hydriodic acid gas, resulting in a compound with the composition of iodide of propyle. Simpson also successfully prepared propylic alcohol from the iodide of propyle and regenerated iodide of propyle using iodine and phosphorus.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
