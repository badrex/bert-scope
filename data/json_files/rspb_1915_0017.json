They found that shallow breathing resulted in lower oxygen saturation, while deep breathing led to higher oxygen saturation. The study suggests that proper breathing techniques can help improve oxygen supply to the body and prevent health issues like pneumonia and phthisis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Respiration and Circulation"}
