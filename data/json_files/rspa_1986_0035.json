The results show that the Percus-Yevick approximation is similar in accuracy to the bulk fluid, while the hypernetted chain approximation is more challenging to obtain numerically and less accurate. Both approximations predict the correct asymmetries between the values of the pair correlation functions for pairs of hard spheres parallel or normal to the surface of the wall.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
