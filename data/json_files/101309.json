He also noted that tidal velocities are strongest at the beginning of flood and ebb and decrease gradually. Sturmy's observations differ from those at Plymouth, and he suggests comparing his findings with those from Plymouth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
