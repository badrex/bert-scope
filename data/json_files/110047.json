He observed that the motion of the needles varied depending on their direction and concluded that the daily change was not produced by a general deflection of the earth's directive power but by an increase and decrease of attraction from a specific point. The exact nature of this attraction and the law of the diurnal change in the dipping needle remain to be determined.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
