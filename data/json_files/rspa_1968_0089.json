They used a sensitive recording system to measure the phase changes in the oscillations as the crystals were rotated in a magnetic field. The experimental data was analyzed using a local and nonlocal pseudopotential to deduce the radial distortion of the Fermi surface and compare it with previous band structure calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
