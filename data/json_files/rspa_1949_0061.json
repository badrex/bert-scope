The authors derive an expression for frequency using the strain relations of Timoshenko and the energy method, finding that three natural frequencies are associated with each nodal pattern. The study provides insights into the behavior of thin shells and has implications for engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
