It compares different definitions of bond order and their corresponding order-length curves, highlighting the limitations and advantages of each method. The author also presents a strong correlation between experimentally determined bond lengths and theoretically calculated bond orders, validating the concept of fractional bond order and its application in predicting bond lengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Orbital Theory"}
