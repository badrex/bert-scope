They focus on the case where the diffusion coefficient of reactant A is much less than that of the autocatalyst and discuss the structure of permanent-form travelling waves. They find that for sufficiently large values, the steady wave structure becomes unstable, leading to the development of oscillatory wave structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": ">-"}
