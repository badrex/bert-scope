The research establishes the reliability of ab initio calculations for interpreting EXAFS spectra of the same material. The findings emphasize the difficulty in distinguishing between atoms of similar atomic mass, such as oxygen and nitrogen, and reveal the ability of EXAFS to provide evidence for structural changes in metal coordination.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
