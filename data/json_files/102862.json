He discovered living animalcula in the semen of young cocks and observed their movement and shape. He also studied the reproductive process of spiders, finding that the male spiders have two working instruments used for taking up food and copulation, which are not the membrum virile. The author observed the male spiders' reproductive fluid containing numerous small animalcula, which are responsible for impregnating the eggs of female spiders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproduction and Development"}
