They found that the decrease in cosmic-ray intensity is related to the warming of the atmosphere, supporting the theory that the temperature variation of penetrating cosmic-rays is connected to the instability of the mesotron. The temperature coefficient of cosmic-rays, as deduced from seasonal data, is found to be -0.18% per degree Celsius, which is in line with the predicted value from the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
