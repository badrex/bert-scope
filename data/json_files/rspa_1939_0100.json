The author examines the Joukowski aerofoil, a specific type of aerofoil, and derives expressions for lift, drag, and moment forces. The article also discusses the stability of a simple rectilinear motion aerofoil, considering factors like angle of attack and the effects of angular velocity and changing circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
