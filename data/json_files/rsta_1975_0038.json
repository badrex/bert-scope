The first sequence consists of tectonized, metamorphic layers with igneous intrusions, while the second sequence comprises nearly horizontal layers of secondary and younger sediments. The study also identified a possible acoustic unconformity that may correspond to a geological unconformity between Palaeozoic and Mesozoic strata.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
