The network has evolved over time to improve its coverage of various satellite orbits and to obtain accurate station coordinates for dynamical analyses. The article discusses the changes in the network, including new station locations, improved instrumentation, and the use of laser systems for range measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
