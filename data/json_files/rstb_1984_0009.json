The researchers found that all gases tested provided some protection against the syndrome, but certain phases were more effectively controlled than others. The composition of therapeutic gas mixtures becomes more narrowly defined as the pressure increases, and the optimum mixture may be different for each phase of the syndrome. The study also explores the potential benefits and limitations of various gas mixtures, including helium-nitrogen and other gases, in deep diving scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography and Marine Biology"}
