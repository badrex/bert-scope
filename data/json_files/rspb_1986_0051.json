The plant has a modular construction with a series of annually produced segments, which can be aged. The analysis shows a balance between deterministic and opportunistic growth, with horizontal modules having an increasing probability of mortality as they age, while vertical modules have the inverse relationship. This pattern of growth allows the plant to have fixed structures for photosynthesis, spore production, and nutrient and water uptake, while also having a highly organized and mobile transport system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Ecology"}
