They used a method developed by Barlow and Pope to analyze the relationship between the crystalline form and chemical constitution of these substances. The study found that the crystal structures of these picryl derivatives can be traced back to the hexagonal and rhombohedral forms of benzene assemblages, demonstrating the influence of the benzene structure on the picryl derivatives' crystalline forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
