Four muscle fiber types are identified using light and electron microscopy, and their anatomical characteristics are analyzed. Three types of motor units are described in the biceps muscle, which correspond to slow, intermediate, and fast muscle fibers. The findings contribute to the understanding of muscle reinnervation and nerve-muscle connections in urodeles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
