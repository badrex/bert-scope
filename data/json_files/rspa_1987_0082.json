The authors explore the evolution equations for these wave packets and their properties, with a focus on media with constant velocity gradients. They also present new phenomena associated with wave packets in heterogeneous media and discuss the reflection and transmission of wave packets at interfaces between different media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
