Davy, conducted experiments to debunk the claim that water is formed by the decomposition of chlorine during the action of muriatic acid gas on certain metals. He found that the water was derived from sources other than the decomposition of chlorine, and explained the sources of error in the previous experiments. This demonstrated that chlorine was not decomposed in this operation, and the conclusions were unfounded.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
