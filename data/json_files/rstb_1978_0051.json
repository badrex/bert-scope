Deltaic reefs are characterized by regular channels and a deltaic pattern at the reef back, while dissected reefs consist of many small, elongate reefs interspersed with wide channels. Both types are part of the same structure, with their differing surface morphologies attributed to bathymetric and hydrodynamic factors. The research provides a detailed description of a major section of the Great Barrier Reef that was previously unknown.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Geology"}
