The authors review the advantages of one-dimensional semiconductor structures, such as low threshold currents, high modulation bandwidths, and low temperature dependence. They focus on the MOVPE growth on submicron gratings and study vertical quantum wells formed during growth on gratings. A new fabrication technique for lasers is proposed, and the application of quantum well wires and vertical quantum wells for Fabry-Perot and distributed feedback laser diodes is discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
