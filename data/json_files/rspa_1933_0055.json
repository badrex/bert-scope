The authors used Fourier analysis to determine the atomic positions and refine the structure, confirming the arrangement of carbon rings and the orientation of the molecule within the crystal lattice. The study provides a detailed understanding of the molecular structure and contributes to the field of organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
