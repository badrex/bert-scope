They study the size and structure of silver haloid grains in emulsions, the effects of exposure and development on grain size, and the relationship between grain size and surface extension. The research provides insights into the physical nature of silver haloid emulsions and contributes to the understanding of photographic processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
