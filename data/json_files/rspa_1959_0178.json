The authors measured the mechanical impedance of three different lubricating oils and analyzed the results in terms of a relaxation spectrum. They found that the oils' behavior can be described by a universal curve, and the differences in their relaxation spectra are due to varying proportions of hydrocarbon types. The study also discusses the connection between shear relaxation and the glass transition temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
