They found that transient temperature changes can be significant and arise from adiabatic heating of the entering gas. The effects are influenced by factors such as gas molecular complexity, pressure, and vessel size. These findings have implications for understanding spontaneous ignitions and the validity of experimental procedures for studying them."}
