The research focuses on the loci controlling adult wing patterns and larval spot colors, as well as the presence of heteropyknotic bodies and differences in sex chromosomes. The findings contribute to understanding the genetics and inheritance patterns in butterflies and may have implications for other orders of insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
