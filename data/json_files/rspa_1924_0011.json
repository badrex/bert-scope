The authors found that the reactions are coupled in neutral solutions, while in acidic solutions, the reactions are catalytic. They also discovered a new oxidizing agent, which is likely an iron peroxide compound. This research contributes to the understanding of oxidation processes and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
