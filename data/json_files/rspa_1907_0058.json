The author develops a mathematical framework to describe the displacement of the medium and its curl in the case of reflection from an isotropic transparent substance. The study focuses on the optical properties of substances like diamond and realgar, comparing experimental results with theoretical predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
