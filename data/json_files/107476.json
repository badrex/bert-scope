The results showed that Skiddaw's height above Derwent Water was 936.03 feet, and the author discussed the potential limitations of using barometers for altitude measurements due to atmospheric conditions. This research contributed to the understanding of mountain heights and the development of surveying techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
