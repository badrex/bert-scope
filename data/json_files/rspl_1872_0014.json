They discover hemoglobin in corpuscles within the perivisceral fluid of Glycera and Capitella, the vascular fluid of marine Annelids, and the blood of Solen legumen. The author also discusses the absence of hemoglobin in the blood of the fish Leptocephalus and the presence of colorless amoeboid corpuscles in other species. This research contributes to the understanding of hemoglobin's role in the animal economy and its functions in different organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy and Physiology"}
