The results showed that cold-rolled iron receives and retains a greater amount of induced magnetism than hot-rolled iron. Hot-rolled iron tends to retain its primitive magnetism better than cold-rolled iron. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties of iron and its potential applications in various industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
