These receptors are part of the lateral-line system and are thought to be electric receptors, not mechano-receptors. The study provides insights into the receptor cells, their structure, and their innervation, as well as the surrounding epidermal cells. The findings contribute to the understanding of the evolution and physiology of electric receptors in fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
