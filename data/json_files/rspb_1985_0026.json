They found that this substance is likely a prostaglandin, as it shares similar properties with other prostaglandins. The hatching substance is not specific to one type of barnacle and can stimulate fully developed embryos to hatch. The process of egg hatching involves a combination of mechanical and chemical factors, with the hatching substance playing a crucial role in the chemical aspect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
