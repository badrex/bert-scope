They found that the viruses were susceptible to inactivation when exposed to light and methylene blue, with some viruses being more resistant than others. The study also showed that living cells of infected animals could protect some viruses from the photodynamic action of methylene blue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
