The researchers found that the bacteria did not multiply in distilled water but thrived in beef solutions. Arsenic, boracic acid, and perchloride of mercury did not hinder the bacteria's development, while quinine and iodine seemed to stop its growth and multiplication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
