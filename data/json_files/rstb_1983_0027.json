The ciliate exhibits remarkable dimorphism, with different morphological forms in larval and adult hosts. The author discusses the potential of this organism as a model for studying ciliate morphogenesis and other biological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ciliate Biology"}
