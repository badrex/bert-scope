Joule conducted experiments to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat in various scenarios, including the friction of water, mercury, and cast iron. He found that a constant relation exists between the work done and heat produced, which is essential for understanding thermodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
