They found that both the phase and period of the rhythm are determined by the constant ambient temperature between 16 and 31\u00b0C. The rhythm is inhibited at 36\u00b0C but resumes when the temperature is lowered to 26 or 16\u00b0C. The study provides insights into the temperature compensation mechanisms in plant rhythms and the effects of temperature and light stimuli on these oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
