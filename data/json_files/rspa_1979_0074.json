They found that a spherical atom-atom potential, along with molecular point quadrupole interactions, does not predict the observed orthorhombic Cmca space group. However, when the atom-atom potential is replaced by a flattened one, the correct space group is predicted, and the crystal is free from internal forces. This study helps to understand the lattice potential energy and the crystal structure of solid chlorine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
