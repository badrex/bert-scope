The author examines the cross-section areas of molecules in films and finds that the hydrocarbon chain in alcohols has a similar cross-section as that of acids. The study also explores the effect of double linkages in hydrocarbon chains and the behavior of various esters, amides, and urea. The findings contribute to understanding the molecular structure and properties of thin films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
