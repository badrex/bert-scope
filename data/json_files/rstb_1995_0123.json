The research finds a negative correlation between abundance and body size across species, but no significant correlations within non-passerine and passerine taxa considered separately. The study also investigates the correlation between geographical range and body size, finding that species' abundance and geographical range are positively correlated and both are negatively correlated with body size.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
