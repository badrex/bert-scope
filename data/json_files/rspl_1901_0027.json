They observed changes in the uterus, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries during different stages of the cycle. They discovered that ovulation can occur without mating and that artificial insemination is possible in sheep. The study also found that the corpus luteum and ovulation are closely related in sheep.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
