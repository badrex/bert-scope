They observed that the sphincter is in a continuous, slightly varying contraction state, which can be inhibited by irritation applied to the rectum. The author also found that the presence of foreign bodies within the sphincter does not cause stimulation or reflex action, but continuous injection of air into the rectum develops a rhythmic action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
