The authors developed a method to accurately measure the equilibrium pressures and temperatures, providing valuable data for understanding gas-solid equilibria. The research contributes to the understanding of adsorption processes and the properties of the materials used.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Surface Chemistry"}
