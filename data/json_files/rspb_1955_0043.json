It explores the interaction between alleles and the distinction between different types of gene models for heterosis. The author also examines the properties of chromosome regions and their divisibility, as well as the Lewis effect and complex loci in various organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
