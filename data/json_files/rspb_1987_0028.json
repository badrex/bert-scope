The determinant is found to be expressed exclusively on the macrogamete, zygote, ookinete, and oocyst stages. The antigen is distributed evenly over the entire surface of the zygote and ookinete but is readily shed from the parasite surface. The study emphasizes the general applicability of the silver-enhanced immunogold method in parasitological research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
