The authors analyze factors that determine the resolving power and discuss the mobility spectrum of ions in different gases. They also explore the effects of ion clustering and the possibility of detecting isotopes of lithium using the method. The study provides insights into the behavior of alkali ions in gases and the potential for improving the resolving power of ion mobility experiments."}
