They found that the number of Lp sites on homozygous LK and heterozygous LK cells was 340 and 120, respectively. The study supported the concept that there are qualitative and quantitative differences in the expression of L antigen on the membrane of LK type cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
