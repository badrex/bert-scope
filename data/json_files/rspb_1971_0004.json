The experiments demonstrate that antibodies directed against virus-specific antigens can suppress the immunogenicity of both virus-specific and host antigens, and that pre-immunization with another complex antigen can lead to a secondary response to the new antigen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
