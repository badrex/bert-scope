The technique simplifies complex spectra, resolves hyperfine structure, and determines Stark or Zeeman splittings. The author explores various applications and level schemes, highlighting the advantages of using a second laser to probe population redistribution induced by the pump laser.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
