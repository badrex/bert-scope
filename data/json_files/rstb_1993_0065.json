It highlights three main selective forces affecting signal size and form: the degree of conflict or cooperation, signal efficacy, and stimulation of the receiver's sense organs. The author concludes that while some understanding of these selective forces exists, a comprehensive general theory of signaling is still elusive due to the complexity of their interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
