They discuss the limitations of the original theory and propose an extension using the wave mechanical theory of semi-conductors. The authors explain the asymmetry in the current-voltage curve and the large additional resistance in crystal rectifiers, which is caused by the reflection of electrons at the transition layer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
