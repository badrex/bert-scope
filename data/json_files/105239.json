The lightning entered the farmhouse through the windows and tore through walls, ceilings, and floors, leaving a smoky residue and a sulphurous smell. It also affected trees nearby, leaving furrows in the bark and the ground. In another house, lightning struck the chimney, melted metal objects, and injured two women and a man.
