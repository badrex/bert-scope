It highlights the contributions of key scientists like Rutherford, Soddy, and others in discovering and understanding isotopes, isomers, and the fundamental law of radioactive change. The article also explores the evolution of thinking around the determinism of radioactive properties and the fluctuations in radioactive decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nuclear Chemistry"}
