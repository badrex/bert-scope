They discovered that ATP synthesis occurs in two steps and the driving force for the reaction is provided by the interaction of Na with the pump. The sodium pump catalyzes ATP synthesis, which is essential for cellular functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Biophysics"}
