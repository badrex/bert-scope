By fusing the stone with boracic acid and then decomposing it with mineral acids, Davy was able to separate and identify the various earths and metallic oxides present in the stone. This method allowed for a more accurate analysis of these stones and their components.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
