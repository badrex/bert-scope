The authors found that the explosion behavior of these mixtures was similar, with slight differences in the time taken to reach maximum pressure and cooling rates. The study provides valuable data for calculating the volumetric heat capacities of carbon dioxide and steam at high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
