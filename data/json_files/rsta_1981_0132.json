The study finds that the presence of a component of gamma-ray emission related to non-atomic gas is evident in both the SAS-2 and COS-B data, and the emissivities of each component can be independently determined. The results provide insights into the local gamma-ray emission and the properties of the interstellar medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
