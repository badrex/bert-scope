The parhelia appeared as two bright spots on either side of the sun, with colors gradually forming a rainbow-like arch. The Aurora Borealis was observed as a red vapor with small black clouds, followed by streams of red light resembling pillars in the air. These events lasted for about an hour before returning to normal.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
