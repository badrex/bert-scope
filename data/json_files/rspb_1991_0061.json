This inhibition is mediated by a pertussis toxin-sensitive G protein and is independent of changes in adenylate cyclase activity. The findings suggest that the p-opioid receptor belongs to the superfamily of G-protein-coupled inhibitory neurotransmitter receptors that modulate calcium and potassium channels and adenylate cyclase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
