This gas was found to be different from chlorine and had unique reactions with water and alkaline solutions. The author also discussed the possibility of the gas being a mixture with chlorine and the formation of hyperoxymuriates when mixed with alkaline solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Reactions"}
