They describe the conformation of the molecule in relation to its hydrogen bonding scheme and discuss the possible catalytic mechanism. The study reveals a new buried acid group that is part of a hydrogen bonding system involving the active serine, which helps explain how serine can become a powerful nucleophile through a \"charge relay system.\" The authors also define the catalytic binding site using diffraction studies of substrate binding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
