They analyze the chemical structure of lysozyme substrates, focusing on the disaccharide and tetrasaccharide, and their cleavage by the enzyme. The study provides insights into the specificity, kinetics, and mode of action of lysozyme, as well as the role of lysozyme inhibitors and their interaction with the enzyme's active site.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
