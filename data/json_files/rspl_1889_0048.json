They found that by using combustible gases like hydrogen, they could create a gas battery that produced continuous currents. However, the cost of large-scale production made it impractical for commercial use. The authors also discussed a new dry gas battery invented by Ludwig Mond and Carl Langer, which was more efficient and powerful than their own experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
