The research concludes that the ion produced by irradiation is responsible for strong excess phonon scattering, with both resonant and non-resonant components. The thermal conductivity at low temperatures provides a useful method for determining the concentration of impurities in MgO.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
