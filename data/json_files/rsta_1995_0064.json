The model simulates the Arctic climate and its sensitivity to increased concentrations of greenhouse gases. The authors compare the model's simulation of various Arctic climate features against observations and discuss its projections of future climate change in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
