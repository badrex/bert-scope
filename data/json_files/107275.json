He discovered a new method of decomposition using electricity and found that a mixture of oxygen and ammonia could be detonated, providing an easy and precise method of analyzing the volatile alkali. The author also studied the effects of different gas proportions on combustion and decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
