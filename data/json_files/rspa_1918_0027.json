They discuss the differences between their results and those of other researchers, such as Walker, and provide a detailed explanation for the discrepancies. The study focuses on the internal electromagnetic forces and the effects of acceleration on the electron's shape and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
