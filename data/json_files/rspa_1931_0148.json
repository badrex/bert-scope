The authors discuss the theoretical background, experimental setup, and procedure, and provide a comparison between the experimental results and the classical dispersion theory of Drude and Lorentz. The study contributes to the understanding of X-ray physics and the development of X-ray spectroscopy techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
