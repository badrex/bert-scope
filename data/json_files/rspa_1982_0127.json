The first method is a straightforward Ansatz, and the second method uses gauge covariant constant spinors. The paper focuses on the specific case of massive-vector Green functions on complex projective spaces, providing a detailed analysis of their structure and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Complex Geometry"}
