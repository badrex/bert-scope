It highlights the differences between plant and animal signal-response coupling mechanisms and the importance of calcium as a second messenger and regulator of plant cell processes. The article also discusses the current understanding of calcium-selective channels in plant cell membranes and their roles in signal transduction and regulation, as well as the potential for future research using modern techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
