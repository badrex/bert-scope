They show that there is a one-to-one correspondence between direct reductions and compatible first-order quasi-linear differential constraints, and demonstrate how this connection can be used to analyze reductions of partial differential equations to ordinary differential equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
