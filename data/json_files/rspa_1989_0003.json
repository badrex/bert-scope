The research focuses on thin-skin surface currents applied to conducting plates with through holes or cracks. The paper provides mathematical models for electric field distributions and confirms the incident and leakage field distributions for both circular holes and through cracks using experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromagnetic Fields and Waves"}
