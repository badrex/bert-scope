The model takes into account molecular transport processes, convection, and turbulent diffusion. The authors provide exact solutions for one-dimensional, axially symmetrical, and steady-flow homogeneous reactor systems, and discuss the implications for practical applications in engineering equipment, such as furnaces, diesel engines, and gas turbines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
