They discuss the concept of spoon faults, which flatten in depth, and their role in the reconstruction of the faulted ore bodies. The study provides insight into the sedimentary basin that originally included the Mt Isa ore bodies and suggests the existence of a concealed central part between Isa and Hilton.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Structural Geology"}
