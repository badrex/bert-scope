Mice raised in hot and cold climates exhibited higher variability in body weight compared to those raised in temperate conditions. The research suggests that environmental factors can affect phenotypic variation during development, with implications for biometrical genetics, selective breeding, and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
