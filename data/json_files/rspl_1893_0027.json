They discovered that the upper side of the fish has pigmented chromatophores, while the lower side is mostly transparent. The coloration elements, such as iridocytes and chromatophores, play a significant role in the fish's appearance. The authors also conducted experiments to understand how coloration develops in fish and found that it is a congenital, not an acquired, trait.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
