This effect occurs when the cytochrome system in young barley roots temporarily fails, leading to a change in oxidation mechanism without affecting growth or salt uptake. The study provides insights into the differences between barley and wheat root respiration and the role of the cytochrome system in plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
