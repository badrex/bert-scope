They show that the stripping mechanism can explain experimental data from inelastic scattering, but it is unlikely to be as useful for nuclear spectroscopy as other reactions. The study focuses on the effects of relaxing certain approximations in the theory and provides a clearer and simpler derivation of the differential cross-section.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
