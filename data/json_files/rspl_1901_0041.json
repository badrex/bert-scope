They discovered changes in the spectrum, with hydrogen lines becoming brighter and other lines fading. The author also found evidence of possible rotations or spiral movements of particles traveling at different velocities. This research contributes to our understanding of the behavior of stars and their evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
