They develop a closed system of equations for the defining scalars and find that there is an exact balance between the dissipation of kinetic energy by viscosity and the liberation of potential energy by gravity. The study also reveals that the field of turbulence can be analyzed into two modes, with kinetic energy being confined primarily to the vertical or horizontal direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
