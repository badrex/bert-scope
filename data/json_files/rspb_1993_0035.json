They found that the crystals in each strain have different shapes and sizes, suggesting that the biomineralization process is strain-specific. This research contributes to the understanding of how bacteria create and control the formation of magnetic crystals within their cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
