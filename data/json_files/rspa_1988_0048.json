They determine the coefficient of the electric-field-induced field gradient in HCl, considering factors like bond lengthening, zero-point bending motion, and the effect of the electric field due to the hydrogen bond. This study provides insights into the polarization of the HCl molecule and helps understand the properties of hydrogen bonds in various chemical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
