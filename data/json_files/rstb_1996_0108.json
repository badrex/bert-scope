The British flora is uniquely suited for this analysis because there is precise information on the dates of arrival, rates of spread, and final spatial distribution of all alien vascular plant species. The research uses modern phylogenetically-based comparative methods to identify traits that distinguish native and alien members of the British flora.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
