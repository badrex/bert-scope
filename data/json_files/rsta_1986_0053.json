By altering specific amino acids, they found that some mutations affected the enzyme's activity, providing insights into the enzyme's structure and function. The study also suggests a model for tRNA binding, showing how the acceptor stem and other regions of the tRNA interact with the enzyme.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
