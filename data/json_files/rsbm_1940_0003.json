He developed a new method based on Hill's work, which allowed him to incorporate various corrections, such as the earth's and moon's figures, direct and indirect planetary actions, and the changing plane of the ecliptic. Brown's Lunar Tables replaced Hansen's as the authoritative source for the moon's position in Nautical Almanacs worldwide. He also studied the Trojan group of minor planets and made observations about Pluto's discovery. Brown's work was laborious, but he was able to manage it by varying the methods of his predecessors and using calculating machines in his later years.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Gravitational Astronomy"}
