The authors observed that multinucleate cells are common in young, actively growing tissues and that the plurality of nuclei arises through mitosis, not amitosis. They also describe a unique process called \"phragmosphere\" formation, where a hollow sphere encloses the daughter nuclei in binucleate cells. This research contributes to our understanding of plant cell development and differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
