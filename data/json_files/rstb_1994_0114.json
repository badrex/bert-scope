It discusses the importance of understanding population size and density, the impact of sampling and trend errors, and the distinction between structural and sampling zeros. The authors provide suggestions for improving the basis for comparative analyses and highlight the need for clear definitions and appropriate data collection methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
