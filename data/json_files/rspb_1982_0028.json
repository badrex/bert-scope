The results show differences in the characteristics of spontaneous m.e.p.ps and evoked e.p.ps, suggesting the existence of two types of quantal transmitter release, one sensitive and the other insensitive to nerve-terminal depolarization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
