The results showed that larvae fed on green and yellow etiolated leaves developed green or brown ground colors, proving that both chlorophyll and etiolin can form the basis of larval coloration. This study provides evidence for the role of modified plant pigments in the coloration of lepidopterous larvae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
