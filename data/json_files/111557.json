He explains the exact formulae for the work of steam in expanding without significant condensation and provides examples of applying these formulae to steam-vessels' engines. The author also discusses the effect of the \"steam-jacket\" invented by Watt and the heat transfer in steam-engines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
