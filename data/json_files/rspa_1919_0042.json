They observed that the intensity of the lines decreases as they move towards the violet end of the spectrum. This phenomenon is more prominent in the presence of water vapor, which suppresses the secondary spectrum of hydrogen. The authors also found that the energy content of the lines may be the same, but their visibility is due to the concentration of energy between a narrow range of wavelengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
