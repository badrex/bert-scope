They provide a numerical solution that considers crimp level, slenderness, and shape function. The study applies the method to tendon collagen and textile materials, demonstrating its potential for understanding and improving the mechanical behavior of fibers in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
