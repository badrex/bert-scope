The authors found that shell growth rates varied depending on the season, lunar cycles, and tidal levels. Tidal level proved to be the most significant environmental factor, with growth rates being proportional to the fraction of time the animals were immersed and able to feed. The study also demonstrated that individual variation and seasonal effects accounted for 70-95% of the total variability in shell growth rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Biology"}
