He reported that the Nebulosa star appeared to grow brighter and larger over time. The observations were made difficult by cloudy weather and the brightness of the stars. Bullialdus also mentioned receiving a letter from Hevelius, who had a different hypothesis about these stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
