They describe the unique features of these plants, including their vascular systems, cortical layers, and lateral outgrowths. The author also discusses the possible evolutionary relationships between these plants and modern-day cycads and ferns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
