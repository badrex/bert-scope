They focus on the case of high conductivity particles and derive an approximate expression for the mean flux in the case of touching particles. The results are applicable to conduction of heat through packed beds of metal particles in water or electricity through piles of carbon particles in air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
