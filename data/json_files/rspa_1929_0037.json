They use Dirac's equation to calculate spin energy and develop a method for nearly degenerate systems. This work provides a foundation for understanding the fine structure of atomic energy levels and intercombinations between ortho- and para-states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
