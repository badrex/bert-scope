The results are explained using the zero-point energy of the solids and a quasi-harmonic model of lattice vibrations. The study provides insights into the thermodynamic properties of these isotopes and their behavior at high densities and low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
