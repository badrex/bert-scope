They found that the resistivities of these metals can be represented by the sum of an impurity resistance and an 'ideal' component due to lattice vibrations. The results showed that the existing theories could not fully explain the experimental data, leading to the proposal of a new semi-empirical expression for better agreement with the experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
