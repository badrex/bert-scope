They discovered that xenon provides an excellent medium for understanding the true origin of Stark displacements and revealed new features concerning the nature of Stark patterns. The study also found that the complexity of the patterns in xenon spectra is greater than in helium and neon, providing a test for any hypothesis regarding the origin of Stark patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
