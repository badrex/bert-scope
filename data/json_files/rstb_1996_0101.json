They use phylogenetic analysis to reconcile fossil and living data, resulting in three subphyla: Linguliformea, Craniiformea, and Rhynchonelliformea. This classification system is flexible and can accommodate future discoveries and changes in understanding of the Brachiopoda.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
