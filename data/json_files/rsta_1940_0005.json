They derive the coupling coefficients in the equation of motion and discuss the differences between the electromagnetic and electrostatic treatments of the problem. The resulting distribution of frequencies is analyzed and the distribution curve is plotted.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
