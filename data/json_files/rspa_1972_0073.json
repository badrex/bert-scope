The authors use a nucleation criterion based on available data to calculate theoretical hysteresis loops, which show favorable agreement with experimental loops. The study suggests that variations in the magnetostatic energy during wall motion may be dominant in determining the final loop shape, offering an alternative explanation to the wall pinning model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
