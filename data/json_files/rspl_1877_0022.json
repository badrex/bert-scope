They discovered that the bubbles move due to slight temperature changes and are attracted to heat sources. This research helps in understanding the behavior of bubbles in various environments and can be useful for examining rock-sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
