Both species have similar diets, dominated by a diverse array of fruit species and complemented with vegetative plant parts, seeds, and insects. Gorillas consume more vegetative plant parts than chimpanzees, but they show different strategies during periods of fruit scarcity to reduce competition for food. These subtle physiological differences have significant implications for the evolution of social organization and niche separation between the two species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
