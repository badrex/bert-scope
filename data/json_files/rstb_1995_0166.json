By comparing gene mapping of sex chromosomes from eutherians, marsupials, and monotremes, the author deduces how the X and Y chromosomes evolved from a pair of autosomes and how the SRY gene assumed control of sex determination. The study reveals that part of the X and Y chromosomes is shared by all mammals, while part of the X was added more recently. The author proposes that a small original X and Y were enlarged by cycles of autosomal addition, recombination, and attrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
