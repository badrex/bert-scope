It explains that transmitter substances are secreted in minimal \"quantal\" packets, which are released spontaneously at random intervals. During stimulation, these packets are discharged at a much higher frequency. The rate of release increases momentarily by a factor of nearly 10^6 following the arrival of a nerve impulse. The article also presents evidence for the concept of intracellular prepackaging of the transmitter in synaptic vesicles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
