The isotopic compositions of these carbon forms suggest that they condensed in circumstellar environments. The discovery of nanodiamonds with high nitrogen content in meteorites provides evidence for their formation in interstellar space or as components of presolar dust.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteoritics and Petrology"}
