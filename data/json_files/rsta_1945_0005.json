They discuss the modified equations for large deflections and provide a detailed analysis of a circular plate with clamped edges under uniform transverse pressure. The study demonstrates the application of relaxation methods to solve complex engineering problems involving large deflections.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
