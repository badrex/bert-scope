They describe various methods to extract alkaloids from plants, such as distillation of coal, beans, and oil-cake. The author concludes that when ammonia is generated from complex animal or vegetable substances, it is always accompanied by the formation of organic bases, suggesting that further research could lead to an increase in the number of organic alkaloids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
