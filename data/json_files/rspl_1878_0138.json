When the stress is strong enough, the glass acts like a crystal on polarized light, producing effects such as orange-brown patches, concentric rings, and a huge black cross on a faintly luminous background. These findings expand on Dr. Kerr's discovery of a new relation between electricity and light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
