They argue that the enhanced lines of some metals, such as titanium, are important in the spectra of some stars and are a prominent feature of the chromosphere's spectrum. The authors provide a table comparing the wavelengths and intensities of titanium lines in the solar spectrum and their corresponding eclipse lines, showing a close relationship between the two.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
