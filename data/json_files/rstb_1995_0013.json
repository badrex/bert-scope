The p53 protein helps induce cell death after activation in response to DNA damage, and its regulation is crucial for preventing the development of cancer. The article explores three mechanisms of regulation: inactivation by cellular and viral gene products, control of protein stability, and allosteric regulation through phosphorylation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
