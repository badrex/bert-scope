The authors found that steapsin can hydrolyze fats to a significant extent, with the highest percentage of hydrolysis reaching 86.7%. This research demonstrates the power of steapsin as a fat-splitting enzyme and opens up further avenues for studying its action in the presence of other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Lipid Metabolism"}
