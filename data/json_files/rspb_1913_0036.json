They observed that granules are extruded from trypanosomes during certain stages of the infection, which helps explain the infectivity of fluids and the \"ultra-microscopic stage\" in these diseases. The study involved various species of trypanosomes and provided insights into the mechanism of granule extrusion and its significance in the life cycle of the parasite.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
