They demonstrate that the stress tensor can be determined without regularization, and the results agree with earlier calculations using point-splitting regularization. This study contributes to understanding quantum vacuum stress and conformal anomalies in curved space-time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
