The authors compare the synthetic diamonds to natural diamonds and discuss the differences in their surface features, such as growth hillocks, hopper or skeletal structures, and smooth cube faces. The study also examines the reflectivity of the diamonds and the possible presence of a low-reflecting film or metallic carbide coating.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
