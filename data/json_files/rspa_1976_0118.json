They explore various models for the irregular variability and periodicity of these sources, including accretion rates, eccentricity in binary orbits, and precessing accretion disks. The authors emphasize the importance of identifying transient sources' distribution and distances to better understand their nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
