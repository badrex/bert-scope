They determined the orientation of the durene molecules in the crystal and found that the structure is similar to the naphthalene-anthracene series. The analysis provides insights into the arrangement of atoms in the durene molecule and its crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
