It highlights the need for permanent secure fixation of the prosthesis to the skeleton and the difficulties encountered in stabilizing hinge-type prostheses at the knee. The author suggests that the incidence of loosening of hinge prostheses at the knee may be higher than that for ball-and-socket prostheses at the hip.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Biomechanics"}
