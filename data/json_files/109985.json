Kater's measurements aimed to improve the understanding of these objects' dimensions and contribute to the final report by the Commissioners of Weights and Measures. The author describes the apparatus and methods used for measuring the cube, cylinder, and sphere, providing a table comparing the data from both Shuckburgh Evelyn's and Kater's experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metrology"}
