The author, Sir James Lowther, explains the experiments conducted to control and manage the gas emissions, including the use of a tube to release the damp air safely. The findings were presented to the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mining and Mineral Resources"}
