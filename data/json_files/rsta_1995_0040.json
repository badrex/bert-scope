The instrument uses a novel multiple-pass absorption cell with astigmatic mirrors, providing a long absorption path length in a small volume. The combination allows rapid response with sufficient sensitivity for eddy correlation flux measurements over a wide range of meteorological conditions. The precision for methane and nitrous oxide is 0.1% of ambient levels with a 1s averaging time. Extensions of the method to measurements of surface-reactive gases such as nitric acid and ammonia are possible using rapid sampling techniques to minimize surface interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
