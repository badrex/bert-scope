They discuss the interaction between intrinsic and extrinsic sources of unpredictability and how they can lead to large-scale chaotic behavior in epidemics, even when the mean field equations have periodic and predictable attractors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
