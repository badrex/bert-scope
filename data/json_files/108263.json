They found that the mean height of the sea around the northern half of the island is greater than that in the southern half, and that the irregularities in tidal heights are nearly the same in magnitude and sign across the coast. The author also examined the relationship between tidal irregularities and barometric pressure, finding a connection between negative barometric irregularities and positive tidal irregularities.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
