They find that the spectrum of carbon is unique and distinct from other elements, and it remains consistent regardless of the presence of other elements like hydrogen, nitrogen, or oxygen. The author also discusses the possibility of a new law in spectroscopy, stating that the spectrum of a compound may not be the sum of the spectra of its constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
