First, they demonstrate the importance of introns for efficient expression. Second, they show that chromosomal position effects at the site of integration can be manipulated to improve expression. These findings can help improve the production of recombinant proteins in transgenic animals for biotechnological applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
