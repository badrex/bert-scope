They compared their results with theoretical predictions and found that the absolute yield values, except for beryllium, were higher than those calculated from Archard's theory and Burhop's fluorescence yield formula. The study aimed to assess the feasibility of microanalysis for very light elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
