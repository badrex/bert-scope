The authors derive expressions for the growth rate, taking into account Stefan flows, transitional corrections, and the Kelvin effect. The study focuses on the constant mole fraction and the behavior of mass fraction and droplet temperature during the onset stage of condensational growth. The findings can be applied to situations where mass fractions of the two components in the growing particle are independent of time."}
