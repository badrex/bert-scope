Through a series of experiments, he discovered that Palladium was actually a combination of platinum and mercury. This discovery showed that the specific gravity of alloys can vary depending on the proportions of the two metals combined, and that the whole doctrine of chemical affinities still offers a field for much investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metal Alloys"}
