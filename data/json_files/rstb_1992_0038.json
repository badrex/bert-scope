Both enzymes have a dimeric structure with two heavy chains and three domains. The binding and hydrolysis of ATP are rapid, but the steady-state ATPase rate is limited by a slow step in the region of product release. Interaction with actin or microtubules accelerates the slow release of products. The article also explores the role of additional subunits in the regulation and modulation of these molecular motors."}
