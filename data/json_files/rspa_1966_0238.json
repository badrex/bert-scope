The experiments reveal that frictional anisotropy is primarily due to anisotropic modes of bulk deformation, which are influenced by the crystallographic direction and the shape of the slider. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of deformation and fracture associated with friction in nonmetallic crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
