They introduce the concept of complete differential coefficients and complete differences of lines, which can be applied to various magnitudes such as forces, velocities, and accelerations. The author demonstrates the application of these concepts to the kinematics of a particle, showing how to calculate velocity and acceleration using differential coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Vector Calculus"}
