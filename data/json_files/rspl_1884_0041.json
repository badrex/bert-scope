They found that native ears were satisfied with the intervals they measured, and discussed the historical context of these scales, including the Syrian bagpipe scale used in Scotland. This research provided a better understanding of non-harmonic scales and their differences from modern, equally tempered scales.", "scientific_discipline": "Music > Music Theory"}
