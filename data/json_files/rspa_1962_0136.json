The theory uses generating functions to reduce the use of probability theory and allows for the direct calculation of required statistics without explicit expressions for distributions. The author demonstrates the method's applicability to various polymerization systems, including condensation of a distribution of functionalities and vulcanization of a chain distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
