Francisco Lana, observed the formation of crystals in a specific location in Italy and concluded that nitrous exhalations played a role in their formation. He also noted that these exhalations could hinder vegetation and coagulate dew, leading to the creation of the crystals. Lana supported his theory by extracting a salt with the taste and figure of niter from the soil, which had a similar crystal structure to the observed formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
