They found that basaltic rocks lie immediately below the sedimentary layer, with a mean thickness of about 1 km. The results from the continental shelf confirmed the gentle slope of the basement rocks seaward. The study provides valuable information about the ocean floor structure and contributes to our understanding of the Earth's crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
