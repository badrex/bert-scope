The author, Everard Home, conducts experiments on a patient who had cataract surgery to study the lens's refractive power and its ability to correct spherical aberration. The findings suggest that the crystalline lens plays a crucial role in adjusting the eye's focus and that its density gradually decreases from the center to the edges, helping to correct aberrations caused by the cornea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
