They found that Tribolium had an advantage in competition with Oryzaephilus due to its greater voracity. The results support the idea that species with similar needs and habits cannot survive together, while those with different needs or habits can. The study also showed that the equilibrium between competing species is independent of their initial densities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
