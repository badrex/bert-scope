They argue against the existence of a lobular biliary plexus and propose that the linear arrangement of cells represents an intermediate stage in the development of primary duct tubules. The study provides insights into liver function and the process of secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
