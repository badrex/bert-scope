It explores how lineaments form the floor plan of the regional tectonic framework and are related to the formation of major ore deposits in Australia. The author also describes the use of lineaments in mineral exploration, such as the discovery of the Olympic Dam Cu-U-Au deposit at Roxby Downs, South Australia.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
