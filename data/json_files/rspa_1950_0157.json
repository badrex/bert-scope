The linearized approximations of the sound wave theory are found to be invalid at large distances, so a modified theory is used to provide a uniformly valid solution for all distances. The results are applied to the case of explosions and show the connection between the flow at large distances and that near the source.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
