Experiments were conducted to determine the extent to which vibratory action and alternating strains affect the cohesive force of materials. The study aimed to provide engineers with reliable information on the strength of materials and the safety of structures, such as railway bridges, subjected to vibration and impact from rolling loads.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
