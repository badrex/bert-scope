They discovered that the line has two components with a separation of 0.033 cm^-1, and explained the observed splitting as an isotope effect due to the presence of three isotopes of magnesium. The study provides insights into the isotope shift and the differences in nuclear fields, which can impact the behavior of atoms and their interactions with light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
