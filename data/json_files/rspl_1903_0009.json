They discovered that tetanus toxine travels through motor nerves to the central nervous system and demonstrated that the transport of toxine to the central nervous system occurs only through motor nerves. They also found that the spinal cord's sensory disturbance and motor rigidity are due to different processes and that the toxine does not reach sensory nerves or nerve cells from the blood-lymph stream.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
