They describe the charge movements in terms of independent subsystems, which are integral membrane proteins, and find that different components of the charge movements can be explained by subsystems with two or three energy levels. This study provides insights into the underlying microscopic details of charge movement in muscle cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
