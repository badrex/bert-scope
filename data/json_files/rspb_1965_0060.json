They found that adult female mice can be rendered unresponsive to the Y antigen through various methods, such as high-dosage inoculation of isologous male spleen cells or parabiotic union with isologous males. The presence of chimerism was detected in some tolerant females, and it was found that a necessary condition for abrogation of tolerance was a detectable level of chimerism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
