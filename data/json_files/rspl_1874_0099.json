They discuss the differences in the bases obtained from cinchonine and coal-tar, and their effects on frogs when injected. The study aims to understand the physiological actions of these bases and their differences from the original alkaloidal bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alkaloids"}
