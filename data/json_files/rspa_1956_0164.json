The study focuses on low concentrations and uses a statistical model to determine the fluid velocity and pressure distribution. The results provide a better understanding of the behavior of suspensions and can be applied to other non-spherical particles as well.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
