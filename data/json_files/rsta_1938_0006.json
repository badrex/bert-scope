They discussed the magnetic anisotropy and temperature variation of susceptibility in these crystals, providing experimental support for the theory developed by Van Vleck, Penney, and Schlapp. The study focused on the crystal fields and their effects on the magnetic properties of the crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
