The authors found that the rate of oil biodegradation, as measured by oxygen uptake, was significantly affected by temperature. The study also showed that the uptake of nitrogen and phosphorus was not greatly reduced at lower temperatures, suggesting that nitrogen supply controls the rate of oxidation. Based on these findings, the authors made tentative estimates of the biodegradative capacity of local seawater.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Biodegradation and Bioremediation"}
