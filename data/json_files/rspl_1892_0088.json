Dixon, discusses the rate of explosion in gases and confirms Berthelot's measurements. The rate of explosion is found to be independent of the tube diameter and affected by temperature and pressure. The presence of steam has a significant effect on the rate, suggesting that steam interacts with carbon monoxide at high temperatures. Inert gases slow down the explosion wave, and measurements of the rate of explosion can help determine the course of some chemical changes. Dixon proposes a new theory for the explosion wave, considering factors like heating at constant volume, the role of unburnt molecules, and the effect of chemical reactions on temperature and wave velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
