The authors investigate the ion-molecule chemistry of the upper Jovian atmosphere and calculate equilibrium and non-equilibrium abundances of products. They specifically examine ethylene concentrations and their effect on infrared radiation during a satellite shadow passage.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
