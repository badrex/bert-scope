The authors found that certain surface effects are secondary disturbances in the reaction, and that the activation energy is independent of initial pressure for some hydrocarbons. They also discovered that the presence of certain gases, like propylene, ethane, and propane, affects the apparent activation energy in specific cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
