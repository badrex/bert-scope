They find that graphite has a hexagonal structure with a well-marked basal cleavage and discuss the methods used to determine the orientation of the planes giving rise to the spacings observed in the powder photographs. The study provides a fuller interpretation of graphite's structure and contributes to the understanding of its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
