He set up two vessels in Liverpool to measure evaporation and rainfall and found that evaporation is a more accurate indicator of the atmosphere's dryness. This research also showed the importance of considering factors like temperature, wind, and soil type when studying the effects of rainfall and evaporation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
