Waller, discovered that the crystalline lens of fish eyes has a unique electrical response called \"blaze-currents.\" These currents are stronger in the anterior half of the lens and are more enduring than in other tissues of the eyeball. The author also found that the lens response is abolished by heat and compression, and it is present in various fish species, as well as in mammalian eyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
