They propose an energetics-based approach to explain the auto-suspension of sediment and the reversal of concentration gradients. The author also provides a criterion for the self-maintenance of turbidity currents and suggests that these phenomena can be studied and reproduced in the laboratory.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
