They discovered that the dilator fibers of the iris are derived from the anterior root of the second dorsal nerve. Additionally, the author presents a theory that challenges the traditional understanding of gravity and suggests that air has no weight, pressure, or density.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurology"}
