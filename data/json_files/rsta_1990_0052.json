It explains how bottom-generated turbulence mixes properties like temperature and salinity, creating a homogeneous layer a few tens of meters thick. The article also explores the vertical and horizontal structure of the benthic boundary layer, including the role of synoptic-scale eddies, fronts, and other processes that can cause fluid to escape from the layer. Understanding these processes is essential for assessing the role of the benthic boundary layer in oceanic mixing and the exchange of tracers between the ocean floor and the interior."}
