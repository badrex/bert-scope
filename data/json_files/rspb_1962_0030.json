Rats that were suckled in large numbers to slow their growth continued to grow slowly even after weaning and became smaller adults. Their life span was similar to larger rats with unrestricted growth, but they experienced higher mortality in the first year of life. Slow-growing rats had a shorter life expectancy than fast-growing ones, and their health was affected by higher incidences of lung infections and kidney diseases. The findings do not support the idea that nutritionally retarded growth promotes longevity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
