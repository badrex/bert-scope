The author conducts experiments on various metals, such as copper, lead, steel, aluminum, and nickel, to determine the thermo-electric differences between free wires and wires subjected to longitudinal stress. The results show that the thermo-electric effect can be influenced by the strain applied to the metal, which has implications for understanding the behavior of materials under stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
