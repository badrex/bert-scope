They explain the process of charging and discharging the condenser, and how the duration and intensity of the discharge can be controlled. The author also discusses the different phases of the discharge and their characteristics, and the advantages of using different types of coils and condensers for this purpose.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
