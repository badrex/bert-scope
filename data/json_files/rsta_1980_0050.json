These materials have potential applications in refractory structural materials, supporters for catalysts, and high-temperature-resistant materials. The process involves converting organosilicon polymers into silicon carbide at relatively low temperatures, resulting in amorphous materials with high mechanical strength and chemical resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
