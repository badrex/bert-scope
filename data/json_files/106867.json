He used an apparatus to collect and measure atmospheric electricity, which involved a long rod, a glass pillar, and a pith ball electrometer. The journal documented the various degrees of atmospheric electricity and the changes in the weather. Read observed and recorded the signs exhibited by the pith balls connected to the rod, noting the positive and negative charges of electricity. He also made connections between the state of his apparatus and thunderstorms occurring in different parts of the island.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
