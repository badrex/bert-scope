The research uses a resistance analogue to describe heat flow from various body regions and determines the components of insulation, including molecular conduction, thermal radiation, and free convection. The findings show that heat loss from the trunk depends mainly on the mean fleece depth, while the legs' sensible heat loss depends on local tissue resistance. The total heat loss is closely related to the mean skin temperature of the trunk.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
