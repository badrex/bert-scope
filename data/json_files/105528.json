The tide rose unexpectedly high, then quickly receded, only to rise again. This unusual event was observed at various locations along the River Avon, with similar occurrences reported in Gloucester and Worcester. The strong, rapid tide of the River Severn was also likely affected.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Processes"}
