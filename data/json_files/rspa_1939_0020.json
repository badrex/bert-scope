They found that the quantum efficiency remained constant over the range of wavelengths from 440 to 560, supporting the conclusion that the quantum efficiency is close to unity. This study provides insights into the photochemical mechanism of visual purple and its relation to scotopic vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Visual Perception"}
