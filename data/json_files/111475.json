He explains how to obtain the equation of the curve and surface using cubic and quartic functions. The surface has nodal conics in each principal plane and a cuspidal curve. The paper includes a figure showing the form of the surface for a specific case.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
