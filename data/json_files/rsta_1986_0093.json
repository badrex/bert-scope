They explain that the effectiveness of this barrier is due to the variety of constituents in the clay formations, such as clay minerals, carbonates, and organic matter. Mathematical modeling tools help predict the migration distances of radionuclides in clay formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
