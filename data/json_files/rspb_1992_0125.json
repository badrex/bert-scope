The results suggest that the thylacine is a sister group to Dasyuridae, supporting the hypothesis that Thylacinus represents an ancient Australian marsupial lineage. The study also provides insights into the relationships within the Dasyuridae family.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marsupials"}
