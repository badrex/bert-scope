The authors found that snake venom primarily affects the nerve centers, leading to paralysis and death. They also discuss the potential for artificial respiration to save lives in cases of snakebite and explore the possibility of finding an effective antidote.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurotoxicity"}
