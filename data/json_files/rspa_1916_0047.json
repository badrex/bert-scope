{"article_id": "rspa_1916_0047", "revised_title": "Mechanical Relations of the Energy of Magnetisation", "semantic_tags": ["Magnetism", "Magnetic energy", "Magnetic fields", "Magnetic potential", "Magnetic induction"], "tldr": "The authors explore the mechanical relations of the energy of magnetisation, discussing the distribution of magnetic energy in a field and the separation of energy into its fundamental constituents. They emphasize the importance of considering magnetic energy as potential energy and address discrepancies in the expression for the total energy of a magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
