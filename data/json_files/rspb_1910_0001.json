They discovered that metals like aluminum and zinc inhibit bacterial growth by generating hydrogen peroxide through oxidation. This finding suggests that the germicidal effect is not solely due to the presence of peroxide but is associated with the process of metal oxidation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Microbiology"}
