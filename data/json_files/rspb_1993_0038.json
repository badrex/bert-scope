It shows that females with limited access to food allocate less of their own and male-derived nutrients to reproductive tissue, while retaining a greater proportion of nutrients within their somatic tissue. The research also suggests that parental investment changes in response to nutrient stress, with females investing less when under stress. The findings provide insights into the reproductive behavior and sexual selection in bushcrickets.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
