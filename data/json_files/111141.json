The Megatherium's teeth, skull, and vertebrae share similarities with the Sloth, while its pelvis and limb bones exhibit distinct characteristics. This study contributes to our understanding of mammalian evolution and the classification of extinct species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalian Evolution"}
