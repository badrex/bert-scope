H. Darwin. The study examines the accuracy and irregularities of the tidal data collected from 1883 to 1885, comparing the two locations and discussing the implications of their findings. The authors conclude that the observations at Dover were made poorly, rendering many of the results unreliable, while the Ostend observations were of better quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
