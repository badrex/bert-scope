They found a system of cr- and \u03c0-bonding from the cyclopentadienone ligand to the cobalt atom. The crystal structure revealed a non-planarity of the cyclopentadienone ring, with a tilt angle of 21.3\u00b0. The study provides insights into the bonding and molecular interactions in organometallic complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
