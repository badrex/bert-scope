They use a simple trial function and a suitable coupling constant to obtain a reasonable fit to the observed values. The results are in agreement with previous work in the weak coupling limit and are sensitive to the assumed value of the cut-off.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
