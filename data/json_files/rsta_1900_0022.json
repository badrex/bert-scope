The author develops methods to determine the correlation and its probable error, expanding on the concept of correlation coefficients and their applications in understanding inheritance and evolution. The work is essential for the study of genetics and evolutionary biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
