By neglecting damping, the author derives expressions for frequencies, amplitudes, and coupling directly from the differential equations of the circuits. A graphical method is also introduced to solve the problem. This study has implications for understanding the behavior of electrical circuits and their applications in wireless telegraphy.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
