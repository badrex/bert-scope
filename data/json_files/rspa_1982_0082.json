The authors used ab initio molecular-orbital computations with a split-valence 4-31G basis set to analyze the geometric structural and rotational parameters, dipole moments, wavenumbers of vibrational transitions, and thermodynamic properties of the molecules. The results show good agreement with experimental data, providing insights into the anomalous stability of antiperiplanar HONO.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum chemistry"}
