They found that soaking tissues in glycerol-saline solutions before freezing significantly improved survival rates. The study also explored different freezing methods, including ultra-rapid freezing, and discussed the potential mechanisms of cellular damage during freezing and thawing processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
