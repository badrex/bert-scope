It highlights the role of the self-correcting DNA polymerase and the primosome in the replication process, as well as the discontinuous synthesis of the lagging strand, which generates Okazaki fragments. The findings from prokaryotic systems provide insights into the DNA replication process in eukaryotic cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
