They find that the presence of conjugated systems in a closed ring does not cause optical exaltation, contrary to previous predictions. The phenomenon of optical exaltation is explained by an additional partial refraction associated with absorption bands in the ultraviolet or visible spectrum carried by the electrons of the conjugated system.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
