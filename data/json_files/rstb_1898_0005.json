They observed the process of fertilization, the formation of the neck cells, and the role of the ventral canal cell. The research also involved counting chromosomes in various cells and tissues of the plant. The findings contribute to the understanding of plant reproduction and the development of the oophyte.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
