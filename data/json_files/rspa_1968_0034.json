The authors introduce the concept of wave action density and demonstrate how it can be used to calculate changes in amplitude in a slowly varying medium. They also discuss the connection between wave packets and the adiabatic invariant, which is analogous to the conservation of energy in a classical simple harmonic oscillator.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave theory"}
