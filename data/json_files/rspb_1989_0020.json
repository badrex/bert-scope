The study finds that noradrenaline, ATP, and angiotensin II increase the conductance to both potassium (GK) and chloride (GC1) ions. The potassium conductance increase is blocked by the polypeptide toxin apamin, suggesting the presence of specific calcium-activated potassium channels. The results indicate that the open probability of potassium channels during the hormonal response is high, and the chloride conductance increase may be due to a membrane carrier rather than low unitary conductance chloride channels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
