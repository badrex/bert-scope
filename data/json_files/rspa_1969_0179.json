They used a radial distribution function to calculate the shifts and found that the direct interionic interactions are responsible for the nonlinearity. The study provides a better understanding of the mechanism behind the chemical shifts and the cause of the nonlinear concentration dependence.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
