The authors analyze the data collected, including the position and behavior of quiet arcs, the direction of flaming aurorae, and the coloration of the auroras. They also explore the possible connections between these observations and solar activity, the outer Van Allen radiation belt, and geomagnetic disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
