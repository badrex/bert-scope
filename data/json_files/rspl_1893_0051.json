This compound, which they called the \"CuO reducing product,\" can be extracted from various animal and vegetable proteid matters. The author found that this compound shares similar properties with Landwehr's \"animal gum\" and can be converted into glucosazone. This discovery sheds light on the complex structure of proteins and their relationship with carbohydrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
