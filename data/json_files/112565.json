The author, John Wood, and his assistants dissected 36 subjects, documenting 558 muscular variations. The study focuses on the muscles of the head and neck, arms, and legs, providing insights into the origin and frequency of these abnormalities. The article highlights the importance of understanding these variations for a better understanding of human anatomy and muscular system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Anatomy"}
