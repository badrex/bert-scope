The hypothesis is based on Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and suggests that energy is transferred through the medium, moving perpendicularly to the plane containing the lines of electric and magnetic intensity. The author examines the basis of Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and its implications for electric and magnetic energies in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
