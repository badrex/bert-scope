They found that the gas phase reaction between methylene and ethyl chloride resulted in the formation of various products, and the reaction mechanism involved a free radical process. The authors also observed that the selectivity shown by the two species of methylene (singlet and triplet) is a result of differences in electronic structure rather than energy content.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radical Chemistry"}
