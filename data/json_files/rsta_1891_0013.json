They discovered that the anomalous behavior of the electrometer was not caused by increased tension of the fibers, and they proposed a new method to measure power given by an alternating or intermittent current. The authors also provided detailed instructions for adjusting and maintaining the electrometer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
