Orowan is credited with introducing the concept of dislocations as the essential mediators of plastic deformation in materials. His work on crystal plasticity, including his observation of the jerky motion of dislocations, laid the foundation for understanding the behavior of materials under stress and led to advancements in materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
