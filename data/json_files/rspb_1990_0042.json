The Isbister tribe, living on hilly terrain and engaging in heavy uphill work, shows a higher degree of preferred orientation compared to the Quanterness tribe living on level ground. The results indicate that the bone texture reflects the lifestyle and activities of the individuals, suggesting that bone structure adapts to the mechanical forces it experiences.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeology and Human Evolution"}
