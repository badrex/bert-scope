He provides a detailed analysis of its shell, which has a distinct six-sided shape and no spiral twists. Sibbald also discusses the animal's body structure, including its cirri or arms, and its attachment to whales. This creature is a new type of Polypus found in the region, and Sibbald shares his observations to contribute to the understanding of natural history.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
