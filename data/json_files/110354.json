He suggests a method to determine the dip without inverting the poles of the needle and also proposes a compound needle to measure both the dip and intensity. This would provide more accurate and faster results, reducing the need for tedious observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
