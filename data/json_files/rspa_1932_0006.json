The results showed that the most reactive methane-oxygen mixture was 2CH4 + 02. The experiments also demonstrated the influence of temperature, pressure, and moisture on the reaction periods. The findings support the hydroxylation theory and provide evidence against the peroxidation theory in hydrocarbon combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
