The exact solution of this one-dimensional problem is given, and the elastic scattering and break-up amplitudes are explicitly determined. The behavior of the corresponding cross-sections is discussed, and the domain of validity of approximation methods is examined.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
