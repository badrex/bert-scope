The researchers used various electron microscopical techniques to analyze the outer layers of the organism. They discovered a complex structure composed of two layers: a honeycomb network and a layer of spines. The structured envelope is separated from the cells by an amorphous zone, which may play a role in cell cohesion. The significance of the structured envelope is still uncertain, but it may help separate the organism into tablets by preventing intercell cohesion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
