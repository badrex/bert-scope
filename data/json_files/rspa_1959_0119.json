The authors investigate the pressure broadening of rotation lines in vibration-rotation bands and compare the behavior of lines with different properties. They provide a theoretical and experimental procedure to measure the relative widths of a given line for different added gases, allowing for the calculation of effective collision diameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
