They discovered that the resistance encountered by water in pipes depends on the product of the fluid's viscosity and the velocity, which helps explain the transition from laminar to turbulent flow. This research provides a foundation for understanding fluid dynamics and the behavior of fluids in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
