These trabecular structures contain type IV collagen, laminin, and nidogen, and may be linked to primitive epithelial structures. The presence of these structures could support the view that they are integrators of extracellular matrix polymeric proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
