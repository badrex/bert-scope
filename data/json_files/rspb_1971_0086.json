The syndrome impacts the development of solid epithelial buds, which form structures like hairs, glands, and teeth. This study examines the gland development and the role of the tabby gene in the syndrome, providing insights into the mechanisms behind the disorder.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
