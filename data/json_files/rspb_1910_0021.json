They found that the nitrogen retention increased as the tumor grew, indicating that the tumor cells obtained their nitrogen from the host's nitrogenous material. The results showed that less nitrogen was needed to build up a given weight of tumor tissue compared to somatic tissue, which may explain the rapid growth of the tumor cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Research"}
