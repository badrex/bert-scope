The author investigates the role of a chloride pump and passive diffusion of ions in maintaining these potential differences. The findings suggest that a more complex system, including both passive and active movement of chloride ions, can better explain the observed results.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
