The authors use both photographic and photoelectric methods to analyze the fluorescence, finding that the 3650 A group of mercury lines excites fluorescence in all type I and type IIa diamonds, while type IIb specimens do not emit fluorescence with this wavelength. The results provide insights into the nature of the centers responsible for diamond fluorescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
