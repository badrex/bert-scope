They found that the high-velocity tail of the distribution function deviates significantly from the Maxwellian distribution, leading to important consequences for heat transport and ionization balance in the plasma. The results are sensitive to the gradients and reveal a strongly anisotropic character of the high-velocity tail of the distribution function.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
