The research found significant genetic differences between the two groups, but their physiological responses were similar, indicating the influence of environmental factors. The high frequency of G6PD deficiency in Kurdish Jews raises questions about its origin and the role of natural selection in this population. Further research is needed to identify genetic factors affecting physiological functions and to understand the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors in determining human characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics and Anthropometry"}
