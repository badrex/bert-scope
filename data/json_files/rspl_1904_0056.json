The authors determined densities and solubilities using two methods and observed the solutions at various temperatures between 0\u00b0C and 90\u00b0C. They also measured osmotic pressures at boiling points, providing a tabular form of their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
