The authors argue that the solvent's dielectric constant and its influence on the central solute molecule's fluctuating electrostatic field play a crucial role in determining the energy levels. They also explore the implications of these findings for electronic and vibrational spectra, as well as nuclear resonance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
