They discovered that vanadium is a poisonous substance that causes symptoms like paralysis, convulsions, and changes in respiration. The authors also found that vanadium affects the vaso-motor center and the respiratory nervous center, leading to a decrease in blood pressure and respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Toxicology"}
