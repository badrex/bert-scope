It shows that juvenile lionesses gradually transition to group-territorial defense between 8 months and 42 months of age. The research also highlights the difference in territorial development between males and females and emphasizes the importance of the juvenile period in the formation of adult behavioral strategies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
