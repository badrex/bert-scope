One class consists of viral mRNAs, while the other class is thought to be the template for genome replication. The syntheses of these two classes of cRNAs have different features and are regulated differently, indicating that they are synthesized by different mechanisms. The article also examines the primary structure of these cRNAs and their 5' and 3' terminal nucleotide sequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
