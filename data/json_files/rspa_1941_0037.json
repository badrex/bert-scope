They found that the relation between dissociation constants and ionic strength is not linear for the methylamines, indicating a change in heat capacity during ionization. This study provides valuable data on the thermodynamic functions of these compounds and helps to understand their behavior in aqueous solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Chemistry"}
