The results show that after 21-28 days of monocular deprivation, the deprived eye's input forms narrow stripes in the visual cortex. Reverse suturing can cause the stripes to expand, while reopening does not produce any change. The findings suggest that reverse suturing allows for the formation of new connections and the regeneration of synapses in the visual cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
