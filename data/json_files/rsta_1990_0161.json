It introduces the Lagrangian representation and the kinematic template, which is the natural motion of fluid particles. The article also explores various applications of chaotic advection, such as flow visualization, particle motion around objects, and particle separators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
