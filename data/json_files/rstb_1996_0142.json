The research focuses on factors such as body size, abundance, foraging behavior, and reproductive behavior of prey species. The findings provide insights into the impact of predation on the morphology, reproductive behavior, and other characteristics of prey species, and contribute to a better understanding of predation as a selection pressure in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
