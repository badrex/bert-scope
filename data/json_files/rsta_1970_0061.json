They use experimental criteria to identify orbitals and explain how the orbitals of halides of elements in different groups are related. The study provides insights into the orbital structure of various molecules, contributing to the understanding of molecular bonding and electronic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
