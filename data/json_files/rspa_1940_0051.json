They measured the quantum efficiency of the reaction and found that the hydrazine in the system removed hydrogen atoms more rapidly than expected, affecting the ammonia decomposition process. The results provide essential information about the photochemistry of hydrazine and contribute to the understanding of ammonia's reaction mechanism."}
