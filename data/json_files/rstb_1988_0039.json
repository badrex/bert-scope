They discuss the presence of circular plasmids, linear plasmids, and the role of repeated DNA sequences in the structure and evolution of these genomes. The study contrasts the ability of mitochondria and chloroplasts to fuse, which affects their respective genome structures and evolution rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
