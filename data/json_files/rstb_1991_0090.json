They demonstrate the extraction and amplification of mitochondrial DNA sequences from bones several hundred years old, and discuss the factors affecting DNA preservation and recovery. The study has significant implications for understanding human history and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
