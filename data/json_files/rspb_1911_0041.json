P. Gregory and W. Bateson investigated gametic coupling and repulsion in Primula sinensis. They discovered that when certain factors are combined, complete or partial repulsion occurs, affecting the traits of the offspring. The researchers observed that the magenta color and short style traits are dominant, and they found different forms of coupling between these traits and other factors. Further research is needed to understand the complex interactions between these factors and their effects on the offspring.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
