The spectrum closely resembles that of europium metal, with many additional resonances resolved in this study. The spectrum is dominated by a \"giant resonance\" attributed to 4d to (4f, ef) transitions occurring above the main threshold for 4d ionization. The authors propose identifications for the main features and support them with Hartree-Fock calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
