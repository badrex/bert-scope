They found that the decomposition is a surface reaction, with silver and an amorphous material (possibly carbon or cyanogen) as the solid decomposition products. The decomposition rate slows down after an average depth of about 20 \u00c5 has decomposed. The silver is highly mobile on the crystal surface and can aggregate at isolated points, showing epitaxy under certain conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
