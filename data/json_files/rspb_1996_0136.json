They suggest that even a small probability of related males displaying on the same lek can lead to indirect fitness benefits, which can override direct mating success. The authors use data on black grouse and ruff to show that kin selection can alter the optimal lek size for these species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
