They compared the results of two theories, momentum transport theory and vorticity transport theory, and found that the temperature and velocity profiles in the wake were related to each other by an equation. The experiments were performed using a rod with a length of 3 feet, heated by passing a current of about 70 amps through it. The results showed that the width of the wake was somewhat indeterminate, and measurements were taken well outside the wake to determine the temperature distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
