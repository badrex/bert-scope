The authors found that the addition of polyelectrolytes, such as sodium polyethylenesulphonate or polybrene, retards the reaction. The results indicate that the dehydration effect of macro-ions is more important than the electrostatic stabilization effect for sodium polyethylenesulphonate-catalyzed reactions, while the influence of polybrene is mainly due to the electrostatic stabilization of reactants. The study highlights the role of solvation and desolvation in polymer catalysis and the importance of understanding the relative contributions of these effects in interionic reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer chemistry"}
