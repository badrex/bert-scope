The method involves spheroidal harmonic expansions of the local magnetic fields, providing more accurate descriptions of magnetic shielding for non-spherical molecules than previous methods. This formalism is particularly relevant for molecules with prolate or oblate shapes, such as acetylene, helical polymers, benzene, and metalloporphyrins.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Magnetism"}
