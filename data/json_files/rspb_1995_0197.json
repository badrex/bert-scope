They found that there are likely to be two copies of the NR1 subunit in each NMDA receptor complex. This study provides insights into the subunit composition of NMDA receptors, which play a crucial role in fast excitatory neurotransmission in the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience", "sub_discipline": "Neuropharmacology"}
