Selfish genetic elements, such as ultracompetitive alleles and their suppressors, play a significant role in this process. The article presents evidence supporting this hypothesis and its implications for the evolution of mating types and sexual reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
