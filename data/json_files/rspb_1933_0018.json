They find that the results do not support the hypothesis that lead treatment affects the mutation rate, and the data effectively excludes the possibility of a 10% mutation rate. The author also considers alternative hypotheses and discusses the implications of their findings on the understanding of melanism in lepidoptera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
