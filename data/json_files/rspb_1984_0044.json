They used patch clamp recording to measure unitary and Na currents from this preparation and found that the kinetic properties of Na and channels appeared unaltered by vesicle formation. This method provides a useful alternative for studying ionic channels in adult cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
