They found that the efficiency of ionization and energy dissipation varied among the gases, with helium having the highest efficiency and hydrogen showing a significant discrepancy compared to theoretical estimates. The study provides insights into the processes of ionization and energy dissipation in different gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas physics"}
