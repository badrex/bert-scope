Samuelson, investigates the development of certain infusoria and their relationship to spontaneous generation. He observes that monadine forms, such as Cercomonas, are the earlier or larval stages of ciliated infusoria, which develop in response to environmental conditions. Samuelson's experiments provide evidence against the theory of spontaneous generation as proposed by Pouchet and his disciples.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
