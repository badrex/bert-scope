The authors find that seed mass is correlated with other plant traits and that specific leaf area is a key determinant of potential relative growth rate. They also discuss the role of seed size in seedling survival and the evolution of seed mass in different plant species. The study highlights the importance of comparative ecology in understanding plant life histories and ecological strategies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
