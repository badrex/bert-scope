They discovered three main types of discharge: continuous, grouped, and irregular. The study provides insights into the nervous mechanism responsible for pain and improvements in recording sensory and motor discharges in mammalian preparations. The experiments were conducted on cats and rabbits, using various techniques to monitor nerve activity and responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
