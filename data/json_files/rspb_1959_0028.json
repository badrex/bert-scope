They found that at low doses, cells showed mainly cytoplasmic effects, while at higher doses, all cells exhibited clumping of nuclear material and failure to divide. The study also compared the sensitivity of chick fibroblast cells and Chinese hamster cells, and the effects of whole cell irradiation versus microbeam irradiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
