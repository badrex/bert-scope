They show that complex recurrent spaces of type D are conformally recurrent spaces and decomposable into two 2-dimensional spaces of arbitrary curvature. The authors also determine the general metric of the complex recurrent space of Petrov type with recurrence vector proportional to the principal null vector of the Weyl tensor and discuss its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
