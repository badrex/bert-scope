The author discovers that this enzyme requires an acidic environment to function and acts preferentially on natural fats. The study also compares the action of animal lipase on various ethereal salts and natural fats, highlighting the differences in their selectivity and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
