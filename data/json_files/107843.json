He discovered that the lava's composition mainly consists of fused rock and earth materials, and the gases released include oxygen, nitrogen, and small amounts of carbon dioxide. The author also found that the lava's temperature and chemical properties remained consistent throughout the experiment, suggesting that combustion was not the primary cause of the lava's heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
