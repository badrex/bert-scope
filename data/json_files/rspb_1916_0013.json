They discovered that acids and bases cause muscle swelling, while neutral salts suppress this swelling. The study also found that the iso-electric point for muscle colloids falls within a specific pH range, and that the presence of salts can have an antagonistic effect on acids and a weak antagonistic effect on bases. These findings contribute to the understanding of muscle behavior in different media.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
