They found that heating or cooling the hands could effectively heat or cool the whole body. The study showed that losing 20-25 kilocalories of heat from the hands in 30 minutes did not significantly affect the body's metabolism. The research suggests that localized heating or cooling could be used to regulate body temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Physiology"}
