They discovered that the normal current in the frog's eye is positive and declines rapidly during darkness and less rapidly during illumination. The main electrical effect of illumination is an upward current through the retina, which is positive at the beginning and end of illumination. This research confirms and extends previous findings on the effects of light on the frog's eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
