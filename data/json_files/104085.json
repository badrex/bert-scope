The diamonds were initially found in the ground and sand near the banks of the Milho Verde River, and later in the river itself. The miners believed that the diamonds came from another location due to their current and were searching for the source. The diamonds found ranged from one grain to six carats, with some larger, and had similar properties to Oriental diamonds. However, those exposed to air and sun were more scurfy and lost more during polishing.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
