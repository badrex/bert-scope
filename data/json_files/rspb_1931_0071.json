The researchers found that the amount of inhibition depends on the interval between the excitatory and inhibitory volleys and the strength of the reflex. They also discovered that two inhibitory volleys can cause more inhibition than a single volley, suggesting a summation of inhibitory effects on certain motoneurones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
