The author describes the factors that control the growth and morphogenesis of these cells, including the importance of darkness and the use of an 'embryo-conditioned medium' as stimuli for early development. The article also discusses the behavior of free protoplasts from pro-embryonic units and its significance in relation to development and practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
