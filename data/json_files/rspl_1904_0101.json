The experiments were conducted under controlled conditions to compare the activity of these acids in breaking down cane sugar. The results showed no significant difference in their activity, confirming previous findings and contradicting other experiments involving different compounds. The authors propose further investigation into the behavior of other acids in similar reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Carbohydrate Chemistry"}
