He found a parallax of 2\u00b052' and concluded that his eight-foot circle was a valuable tool in astronomy. Additionally, he proposed a slight alteration to Dr. Bradley's refraction formula based on his observations of different circumpolar stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
