They found that the oil in the seeds is not directly converted into starch, as previously hypothesized, and that fermentation plays a significant role in making the reserve materials available for the embryo's growth. The study also highlights the importance of the endosperm and embryo in the germination process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
