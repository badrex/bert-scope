The experiments showed that bacteria can be carried by air currents and ejected from flowing sewage, even without the presence of bubbles. This study is important for understanding the spread of bacteria in public health and sanitation systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Microbiology and Sanitation"}
