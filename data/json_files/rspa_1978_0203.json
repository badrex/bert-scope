They found that the pentadienes, acrolein, and ethylene are derived exclusively from the pentenes. The authors also determined the distribution of the points of abstractive attack in the pentenes and the reactivity ratios of pent-l-ene to secondary products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
