They emphasize the importance of inbreeding depression as a force opposing the spread of genes that increase selfing rates. The breakdown of distyly and tristyly, types of heterostyly, is also considered, as well as the role of pollination effectiveness and long-distance dispersal in promoting self-fertilization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
