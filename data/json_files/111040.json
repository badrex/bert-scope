The author, Henry Huxley, examines the structure of their organs, particularly the outer and inner membranes, and their affinities with other families. He also describes the reproductive organs and the development of tentacles in Medusae. Huxley concludes that these families should be considered as part of a larger group with a common organization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
