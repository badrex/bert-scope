They created a device that exposed the paper to sunlight for varying durations and found that the shade produced on the paper was not proportional to the intensity of the incident light. This research helped in understanding the distribution of photochemical actions on Earth's surface and the variations in photochemical intensity when the atmosphere is obscured by clouds, mist, or rain.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
