They analyzed the effective Hamiltonian and the spin-rotation interaction, comparing their findings with other techniques. The results provide insights into the molecular parameters and help in understanding the behavior of the NH2 molecule under varying magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
