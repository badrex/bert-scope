They apply the method to the two-dimensional lubrication problem, considering both finite difference and finite element approximations. The optimization problem involves finding the film profile that supports the maximum load capacity for a given minimum film thickness and bearing pad area.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
