They found that the size of the action current varies directly with the degree of tension developed, supporting previous findings that the number of muscular units stimulated affects the response. This research provides insights into muscle physiology and the mechanisms behind muscle adaptation to different mechanical conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
