The researchers used a sector spectrophotometer and a quartz spectrograph to analyze the absorption spectra in the ultra-violet region. They discovered that the absorption curve of normal serum is consistent, with the central band being slightly narrower in females and shallower in children. The main absorption band is found to be due to proteins in the serum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
