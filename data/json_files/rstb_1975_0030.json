Techniques such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and fluorescence measurements are explored, providing insights into molecular motion, environmental constraints, and the motional characteristics of probe molecules. The article also examines the location of probes in membranes, using examples of different fluorescent molecules and their interactions with lipid bilayers and biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Membrane Biology"}
