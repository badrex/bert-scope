The authors review the measurements made of the absorption and scattering properties of lunar fines and discuss their significance for both lunar science and astronomical research. They also investigate the relationship between the infrared absorption properties of lunar rock and its effective thermal conductivity, which has important implications for understanding the Moon's surface and its potential use as a comparison source for far infrared astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
