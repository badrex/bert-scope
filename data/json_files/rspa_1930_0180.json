They found no appreciable radiation in the visible and ordinary ultra-violet range under the conditions for which characteristic energy losses by scattered electrons have been observed. This study did not investigate the spectral region beyond the ultra-violet frequency limit.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
