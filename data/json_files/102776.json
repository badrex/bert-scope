He discusses the possible locations of public buildings and the possibility that the \"Balneum cum Basilica\" mentioned in one of the inscriptions could be a long-lost structure in Rome. Hunter also mentions the discovery of an earthen urn and his plans to share more information about the area in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
