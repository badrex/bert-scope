They discover that the ignition process occurs in stages, with the difficulty of ignition increasing as the gas composition changes. The author also finds that the energy required for ignition varies depending on the gas and its composition, with the ratios of energy in successive stages increasing approximately in a constant ratio of 2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
