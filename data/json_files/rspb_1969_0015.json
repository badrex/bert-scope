The results show that calcium is essential for controlling membrane conductance and the action of adrenaline, while barium can replace calcium for membrane stabilization and spike generation but cannot replace calcium for adrenaline's action. Manganese can replace calcium for membrane stabilization but cannot replace it for spike generation or adrenaline's action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Smooth Muscle Physiology"}
