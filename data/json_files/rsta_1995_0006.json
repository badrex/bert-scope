The positive muon mimics the proton's chemical and elastic interactions when implanted in a material. Muon spin rotation, relaxation, and resonance (muSR) techniques are used to study these defect centers, providing valuable information on their electronic structure and dynamics. The article highlights the metastability and bond-centered state of hydrogen in semiconductors, which has important implications for understanding their properties and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
