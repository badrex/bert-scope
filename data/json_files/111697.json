They studied solar halos and parhelia, discovering that the light was slightly polarized in all cases. The observations showed that the greatest amount of polarization was not more than half, and the direction of polarization was always in a plane parallel to a line joining the observed part with the center of the sun or moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
