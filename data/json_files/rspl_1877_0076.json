They discovered that the direction and intensity of the movement depend on the temperature and composition of the radiometer's components. The author explains the complex interactions between heat radiation and the radiometer's materials, such as glass and mica, and suggests that the inner layers of the radiometer play a crucial role in its movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
