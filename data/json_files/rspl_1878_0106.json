The negative terminal had four bright lines in the spectrum, while the positive terminal had a fluted spectrum with a black absorption band. The author discusses the possible causes of these differences, including heat, chemical effects, and polarity, and suggests that these findings may help explain the phenomena observed in some stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
