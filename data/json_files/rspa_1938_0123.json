They find that the high-temperature polymorph has a more open structure due to the breakdown of rigidity in the resorcinol molecule. This change in structure is connected to the unusually open structure of the low-temperature form, which results from the orienting influence of hydroxyl bonds. The transition between the two polymorphs involves a small heat of transition, which is compensated by increased van der Waals and polarization effects in the denser structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
