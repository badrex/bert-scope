They found that the observed nonclassical absorption is entirely due to vibrational relaxation, and the total vibrational specific heat relaxes with a single relaxation time. The results are consistent with the assumption that vibrational transitions in liquids occur through binary collisions between molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
