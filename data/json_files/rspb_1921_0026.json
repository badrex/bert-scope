They found that different fats have varying effects on tadpoles' growth rates, pigmentation, and mortality. The presence of iodine in the diet tends to reduce the death rate in tadpoles receiving fluid fats. The study highlights the importance of a balanced diet and the potential impact of fat and iodine intake on thyroid function and overall health.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
