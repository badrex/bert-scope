They found that these genes are developmentally regulated and produce major seed storage proteins. The study provides insights into the structure and function of these proteins, as well as their genetic basis, which can be useful for understanding legume crops and improving their nutritional value.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
