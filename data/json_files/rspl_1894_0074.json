The authors discuss the purification process of sulphur and its various forms. They also describe the methods of measuring high resistances and constructing sensitive galvanometers. The experiments reveal that sulphur's specific resistance decreases with increasing temperature and that its specific inductive capacity increases slightly as the temperature rises. The conductivity of sulphur increases significantly at its melting point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
