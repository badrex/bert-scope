They found that ridges can cause strain inhomogeneities and multiaxial stress fields, leading to errors in strain measurement and material fracture. The study aimed to improve testpiece design and performance by investigating factors responsible for ridge fractures.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
