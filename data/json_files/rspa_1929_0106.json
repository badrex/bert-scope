They found that the efficiency varied by a factor of about 2 among the elements and was a periodic function of the atomic number. Molybdenum was the most efficient element, and there was a significant change in the efficiency of elements from chromium to copper as the voltage increased. The results provide insights into the behavior of soft X-rays and their relation to ordinary X-rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
