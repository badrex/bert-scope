The author applies the Pohlhausen method to study the impact of the boundary layer near the wave-front, finding that resistance causes the wave-front to slow down and the water to pile up. The modified velocity of the wave-tip is obtained as a function of time, providing a more accurate prediction of the flow's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
