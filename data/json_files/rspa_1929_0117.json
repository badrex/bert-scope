They use X-ray diffraction to study the arrangement of molecules in crystals and find that the end groups of molecules in these compounds have a centrosymmetrical linkage. This leads to differences in the crystal habits and physical properties between odd and even numbered chain compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
