The study focuses on Bulgaria and compares its findings with those of neighboring countries. The research highlights the importance of accurate dating methods in understanding the secular variations of the geomagnetic field and the evolution of the Earth's core. The article emphasizes the need for further improvements in dating techniques to enhance the reliability of the variation curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
