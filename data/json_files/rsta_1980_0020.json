It highlights the long history of subsidence in these margins, which are often linked to areas prone to subsidence as far back as the Lower Palaeozoic. The article also explores the Permian and Mesozoic rifting periods, the eustatic sea level changes, and the worldwide termination of the rift phase in the middle Cretaceous.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
