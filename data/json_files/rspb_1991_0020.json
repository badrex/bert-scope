These peptides belong to a new family of neuropeptides called SALMFamides and are the first to be identified in species belonging to the phylum Echinodermata. The discovery of these neuropeptides could provide insights into the control of locomotion and other physiological processes in echinoderms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
