This instrument allows for more accurate determination of optical constants and reduces the risk of fracturing fragile crystals. The device consists of a short, wide hollow cone with three movable inner axes, enabling adjustments for various crystal orientations and grinding directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Precision Instrumentation"}
