They suggest that these phases represent the arrival of the condensational and distortional waves, which have traveled through the Earth, and surface undulations of long period that have traveled around the Earth's surface. The study focuses on accurately determining the time intervals and distances from the place of origin to understand the forms of wave motion and wave-path represented by each phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
