They found that the diffuse scattering patterns were in good agreement with the theory, and the symmetry of the patterns was related to the projection symmetry of the crystal structure. The study also showed how the current density plot could be used to determine the orientations where fast electron current density was peaked at a specific site within the crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
