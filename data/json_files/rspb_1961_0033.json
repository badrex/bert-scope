The tricarboxylic acid cycle was found to operate in intact carrots, and the initial stimulation of CO2 output in oxygen was followed by a progressive inhibition. This research provides insights into the complex interaction of oxygen on plant respiration and metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
