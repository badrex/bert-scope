The driving force for this flow is not the pressure difference of the gas but the difference in capillary pressure resulting from surface tension in the pores. This mechanism contrasts with the flow of adsorbed films, which follows a process of surface diffusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Physics"}
