They found that iron can reach a magnetic induction of up to 32,360 when subjected to a strong magnetic field. The author also observed that the residual magnetism in the iron samples was relatively constant within the tested range of magnetic forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
