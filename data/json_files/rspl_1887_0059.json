They argue that the rudimentary tooth-change in marsupials is an early stage in the development of diphyodontism, and that the milk teeth are the superadded set. The authors also discuss the transition from metatherian to eutherian tooth-change and propose a side branch for the edentates, called \"Paratherian.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
