The first method is a straightforward application of numerical integration, while the second method is a novel application of the relaxation method. Both methods provide accurate results for practical purposes and can be used to solve various problems in beam deflection and structural analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
