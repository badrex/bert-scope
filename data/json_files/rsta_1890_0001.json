They observed an increase in the capacity of a glass condenser when heated and compared the effects of temperature on specific inductive capacity and refractive index. The results showed that the specific inductive capacity of a substance has a maximum value near its melting point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
