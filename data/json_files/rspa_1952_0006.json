They used electron-diffraction patterns to analyze the contact planes between silver and halide for various orientations. The results showed that the orientation of the halide on specific crystal facets was independent of the position of those facets with respect to the macroscopic surface, and that surface irregularities, such as steps or cracks, played a role in the growth process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
