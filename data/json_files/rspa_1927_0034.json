The authors found that the catalytic activity of the fireclay surface increased when exposed to carbon monoxide, and the rate of combination was more proportional to the partial pressure of carbon monoxide than oxygen. The study also compared the catalytic combustion of carbon monoxide, hydrogen, and methane on fireclay surfaces, showing that the catalytic power was weaker for carbon monoxide than hydrogen and methane.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
