They found that hydrogen forms a film on the platinum surface, which slows down the reaction. Nitrous oxide reacts with hydrogen when it enters the gaps in the film. The \"latent heat of evaporation of the film of adsorbed hydrogen\" is about 25,000 calories per gram molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
