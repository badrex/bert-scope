The researchers examined 26 animals and found that the bronchial arteries supply the bronchial tree up to the small bronchioles, while the blood from the bronchial artery supplying the hilum drains into the azygos, hemi-azygos, or intercostal veins. The study also discusses the techniques used for injecting the vessels and examining the specimens.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
