They explain that the early stages of the electromotive force development are due to ionization within the cloud, while later stages involve external currents from the cloud's own field. The charging of precipitation elements by ions in a vertical electric field is also discussed, highlighting the role of small ions in the initial stages of building up the electric field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Electricity"}
