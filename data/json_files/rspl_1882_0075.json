The authors, Schorlemmer and Thorpe, analyze the chemical properties of the heptane, including its conversion into chlorides, alcohols, and heptylene. Their findings provide further evidence of the behavior of normal paraffins when acted upon by chlorine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
