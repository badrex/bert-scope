E. Parry, Henry Foster, and J. C. Ross, to determine the amount of atmospheric refraction at Port Bowen during the years 1824-25. They used various techniques, including observing the setting of stars and using instruments such as theodolites and repeating circles, to gather data on atmospheric refraction and improve the accuracy of astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
