He observed the dip and vibrations of the needle under various conditions and found that the dip and vibrations were affected by the position of the needle and the presence of iron objects. This research helped in understanding the Earth's magnetic field and its variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
