This method provides accurate results for all values of the electric field strength, improving upon previous perturbation theory calculations. The phase-integral method involves a general approximation of arbitrary order generated from an unspecified base function, which is chosen in two different ways to suit different scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
