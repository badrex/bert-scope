They find that the pattern of the medulla varies in a definite manner based on the methods of feeding and the type of food. The study includes a comparison of serial sections of the medulla oblongata of the whiting and the roach, two different types of fish with distinct feeding habits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
