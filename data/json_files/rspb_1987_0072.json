The researchers found that the single-channel conductance is 35 pS in normal medium containing 1 mM calcium and 51 pS in the absence of calcium. The currents show strong inward rectification with no outward current being detectable. Outward single-channel currents are detectable in isolated outside-out patches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
