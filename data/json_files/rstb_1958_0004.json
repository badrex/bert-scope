The authors study four areas, focusing on the Itchen drainage basin, Cherwell Valley, Moreton gap, and Daventry-Kilsby-Rugby area. They analyze the possible overflow points of glacial Lake Harrison and its connection to the surrounding rivers and landscape. The research provides insights into the history of the ice sheets and the formation of the landscape during the Pleistocene period.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
