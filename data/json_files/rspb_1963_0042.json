These organs produce brief pulses of sound with a half-decay time of about 80 microseconds and most energy between 30 and 90 kHz. The acoustic performance of the tymbal organ is compared to a simple mechanical model, and previous accounts of the structures are summarized and their possible significance discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
