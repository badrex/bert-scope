They suggest alternative ideas, such as homologous chromosome pairing being accomplished by chance meeting of homologue segments and crossover sites being established before, during, or immediately following initiation of synapsis. The author also discusses the role of the synaptonemal complex in crossover formation and chiasma maintenance. These alternative models provide a new perspective on the complex process of meiosis and the mechanisms behind homologous chromosome pairing and crossover formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
