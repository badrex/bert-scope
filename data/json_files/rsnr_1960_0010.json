Wren's work in mathematics includes solving Kepler's problem and discovering that the hyperboloid of revolution is a ruled surface. His architectural achievements were influenced by his mathematical background, and he applied his knowledge to design and construct iconic buildings. However, his mathematical focus may have prevented him from reaching greater heights in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > History of Mathematics and Architecture"}
