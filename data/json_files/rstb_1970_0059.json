The author emphasizes the importance of studying these plants before they become extinct due to their rapid decline in frequency. The study examines germination behavior, propagule dispersal, and the adaptability of these plants to their unique habitat.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
