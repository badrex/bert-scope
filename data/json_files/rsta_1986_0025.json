It focuses on deformation and seismic activity associated with transcurrent fault systems, such as the San Andreas system, and provides insights into the nature of structural controls governing the nucleation and stopping of ruptures along fault zones.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
