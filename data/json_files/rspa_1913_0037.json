They study its habit, angles, and etch-figures to understand its crystal structure and compare it with other alkali-metal salts. The author also examines the effect of replacing potassium with other elements on the crystal angles and discusses the specific gravities of these salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
