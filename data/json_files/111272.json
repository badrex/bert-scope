They observed that the part of the optic nerve connected to the eyeball remained intact, while the part behind the section became disorganized. The disorganized fibers could be traced back to the opposite optic tract, suggesting that the optic nerve fibers decussate or cross over in the optic chiasma. This research provided insights into the connections between the optic nerves, chiasma, and the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
