Aug. Cahours and A. W. Hofmann, discovered a new series of alcohols, including acrylic alcohol, which is the third term of a series parallel to the ordinary alcohols. They also found that acrylic alcohol has a unique set of properties and can produce a variety of derivatives, such as ethers, esters, and salts. This discovery expanded the understanding of alcohols and their homologous series in organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
