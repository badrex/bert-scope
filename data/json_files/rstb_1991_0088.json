It explores the use of protein sequence information from ancient samples and the challenges in validating protein phylogenies. The article also highlights some anomalies in protein evolution and the role of molecular convergence in certain cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
