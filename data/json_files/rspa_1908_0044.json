They found that the shape of the projectile head significantly affects the trajectory, and developed a formula to calculate the necessary angle of elevation for various projectile shapes. The study also showed that the effectiveness of pointed projectiles decreases with increased air resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
