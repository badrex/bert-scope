This ultra-high sensitivity method allows the measurement of isotope ratios at natural abundances as low as one atom in a billion. The author explains the principles, types of analyzers, and applications of accelerator mass spectrometry in various fields, such as archaeology, geophysics, and nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
