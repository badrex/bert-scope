They discovered that these rays reverse the photogenic effect, rendering the plate repellant to mercurial vapour. This finding challenges the continuing action attributed to these rays by previous researchers and sheds light on the differences between the photogenic actions on photogenic papers and the Daguerreotype plate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photography"}
