They develop a systematic approach to estimate corrections for configuration interaction in wave-function calculations, simplifying the matrix of the many-particle Hamiltonian. This method can be applied to both electronic and nuclear systems, offering a more accurate approximation to an exact wave function.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Chemistry"}
