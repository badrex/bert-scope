They discovered that the organ exhibits \"irreciprocal conduction,\" meaning it conducts an intense current better when directed in a specific direction. The author also found that the organ's response to stimulation is multiple, with each response producing currents in the same direction, reinforcing the force of the primary response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
