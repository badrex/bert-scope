They derive wave functions and corresponding intensities predicting interference fringes on the exit surface of crystals, discussing the effects of absorption and divergence of illumination on the image contrast. The study explores the possibility of obtaining two-dimensional projections of atomic arrangements in crystals using electron microscopic images.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
