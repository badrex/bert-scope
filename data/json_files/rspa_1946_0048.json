The author develops new expansions for the integral involved in the diffraction process, providing more accurate estimates of the approximations. The article also proposes an alternative series expansion for small values of the variable, improving the accuracy of the calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
