They found that the chain arrangement in the crystal structure is a hexagonal, close-packed array of right-handed helices with a random chain sense. This arrangement explains the observed X-ray diffraction pattern and supports the right-handed \u03b1-helix as the structural unit in the crystal of poly-L-alanine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
