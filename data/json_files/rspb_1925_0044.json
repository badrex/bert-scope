They used infusoria as a model organism to determine the time it takes for the arc rays to kill them under different conditions. The results showed that the effectiveness of arc lamps varies, and the intensity of the ultraviolet rays plays a crucial role in their biological impact. This study helps in understanding the best form of arc lamp for therapeutic purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
