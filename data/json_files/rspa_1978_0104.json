The theory involves gradients of quadratic or non-quadratic Lagrangian functionals and can be applied to various problems in applied mathematics. The study covers methods like general optimization, general embedding, and nonlinear programming, providing upper and lower bounds for linear functionals in these problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
