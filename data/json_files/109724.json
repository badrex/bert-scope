They discovered that certain poisons, like oil from bitter almonds, can cause death by suspending respiration, which is dependent on the brain. The heart may continue to contract after apparent death, suggesting that poisons primarily affect the brain and the nervous system. The author also found that some poisons can be applied externally to cause similar effects, and they explored the possible mechanisms for this.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Toxicology"}
