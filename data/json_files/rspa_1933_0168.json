They attempted to prepare atomic hydrogen from hydrides and studied its reactions with various metals. The experiments showed that some metals formed hydrides and displayed interesting phenomena, while others remained unaffected. The authors also described their methods for preparing atomic hydrogen and the apparatus used in their experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical synthesis and reactions"}
