They investigate the diffraction properties of distorted lattices with circularly symmetric statistics, which can be applied to polycrystalline fibers with randomly rotated crystallites and correlated molecular displacements. The study has implications for understanding disorder and molecular structures in polycrystalline fibers using X-ray diffraction analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
