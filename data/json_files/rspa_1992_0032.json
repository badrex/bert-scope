They determine the different types of diffraction patterns and their locations in the acoustic field around a propeller. The study uses the stationary phase method and provides asymptotic formulae for the sound field, which are valid when the number of blades is not too small or when investigating high harmonics. The results describe the propagation of sound along rays and reveal that most of the noise comes from loud spots, which are either within the propeller disc or on its boundary.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
