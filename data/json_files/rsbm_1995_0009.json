He developed innovative techniques for analytical hydrocarbon separations, combustion, gas flares, and oil spill treatment, with nearly 500 patents associated with his name. Desty's work in combustion research led to the development of the MATRIX burner, fluidized beds of ceramic particles, and burners for oil wells. He also contributed to the reduction of atmospheric pollution and the efficient use of fuels through his work on Coanda flares and the recovery of enthalpy in waste materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
