The reaction appears to involve a complex chain with CO as an important intermediate. The experiments provide insights into the reaction mechanisms and help understand high-temperature chemistry relevant to combustion and atmospheric entry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
