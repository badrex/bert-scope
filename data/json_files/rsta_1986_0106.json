The authors use correlated wavefunctions and a single determinant atomic orbital approach to model the crystal's wavefunction. The results show that a fully relativistic approach is necessary for accurate predictions, and the method can be applied to other systems in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
