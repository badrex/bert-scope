They found that the deposits were formed during the Late-glacial Period, with a sequence of organic material sandwiched between two layers of soliflucted inorganic material. The study provides insights into the climate and vegetation of the region during the Late-glacial Period and the subsequent Post-glacial Period.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Quaternary geology"}
