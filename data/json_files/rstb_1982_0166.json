They discover that the slime is produced by the outer root-cap cells and is synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi apparatus. The slime contains at least three polysaccharides, with two being acidic and containing a high proportion of fucose. The author also finds that the synthesis of fucose-containing oligosaccharides takes place in the endoplasmic reticulum, and a glycoprotein carrying a large molecular mass carbohydrate portion containing fucose is synthesized mainly within the Golgi apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
