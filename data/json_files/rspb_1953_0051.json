They found that mitochondria contain the largest proportion of enzyme activity, but the activity can be affected by factors such as the physical state of the particles and the availability of coenzymes. The study highlights the importance of considering these factors when interpreting enzyme distribution results.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
