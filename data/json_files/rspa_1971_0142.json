The method employs a coordinate system that moves with the flame, leading to invariant profiles of concentration and temperature. The authors apply this procedure to hydrogen-bromine flames, comparing their results with experimental data and previous theoretical predictions. The new method offers advantages in terms of computational time and storage, making it a valuable tool for understanding and predicting flame behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion"}
