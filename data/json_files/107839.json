The authors compare their results with the theoretical formula of Laplace and other experiments made under different circumstances. They found that the velocity of sound was affected by temperature, pressure, and wind direction, and concluded that the results were satisfactory, indicating the accuracy of Captain Parry's measurements despite challenging conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
