They found that by performing specific operations on the stem apices, they could induce changes in the phyllotaxis, supporting the theory that the difference between spiral and decussate phyllotaxis does not depend on any intrinsic difference in the properties of the apices. This study provides a more direct test of phyllotaxis theories and contributes to our understanding of plant development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
