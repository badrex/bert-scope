They used improved equipment and techniques to resolve the structures and demonstrated deviations from the interval rule in at least one term, likely due to nuclear electrical quadrupole moments. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the hyperfine structures and transitions, confirming that both bromine isotopes have the same nuclear spin and nearly identical nuclear magnetic moments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
