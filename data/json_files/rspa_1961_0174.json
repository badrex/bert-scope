They found that for nickel, the results agree with band-structure calculations, while for gadolinium, the fractional change in resistivity is almost equal to the fourth power of the reduced magnetization. The study helps to understand the behavior of ferromagnetic materials and their resistivity at different temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
