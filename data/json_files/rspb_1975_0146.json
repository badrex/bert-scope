The researchers found that glutamate can depolarize or hyperpolarize the cells and that the fluctuations resemble postsynaptic'membrane noise.' The study provides insights into the molecular action of chemical agents on neuronal membranes, which could be useful for understanding the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
