They analyze the response of solitons in various scenarios, including synchronization with periodic fields, motion in density gradients, and interactions with impurities. This study provides insights into the resilience and behavior of solitons in complex systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
