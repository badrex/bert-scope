They develop mathematical models of the transmission dynamics of the infection, incorporating factors such as loss of natural and vaccine-induced immunity and variable vaccine efficacy. The study suggests that to eliminate bacterial transmission, 88% of each birth cohort must be vaccinated before the age of 1 year, provided the vaccine confers lifelong protection. If vaccine-induced immunity is less than lifelong, repeated cohort immunization may be necessary to eliminate transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
