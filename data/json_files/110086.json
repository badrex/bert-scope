The collimator is a more accurate and reliable alternative to traditional levels and plumb lines. Kater also explains how the floating collimator can be used to detect errors in other astronomical instruments, such as zenith tubes and micrometers.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Instrumentation"}
