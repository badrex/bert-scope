The authors found that the reactions follow a first-order rate with respect to sugar concentration. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of these reactions and help explain the observed dependence of reaction rates on sugar and alkali concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Carbohydrate Chemistry"}
