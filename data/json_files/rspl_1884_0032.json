They used various methods to measure the resistance and temperature of copper wires with different coatings and found that the covering had little to no effect on the permanent temperature of the wires. The author also discussed the efficiency of heat emission and loss through different surface coatings and materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
