By comparing classical writings, such as Ovid's letters from Pontus, with modern accounts, Barrington examines the impact of climate change on Northern Europe. He finds that the severity of the cold has decreased in the 17th and 18th centuries, which may be due to changes in cultivation and geography.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Change"}
