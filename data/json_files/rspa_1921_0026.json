The author focuses on the case of chlorine, which has two isotopes with atomic weights 35 and 37. He presents a method to experimentally determine if chlorine is a mixture of these isotopes or if it undergoes decomposition in a discharge tube. The author also speculates on the behavior of electrified atoms and their potential to form compounds, which could lead to interesting discoveries in chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Theory and Isotopes"}
