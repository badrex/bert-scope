They explore the cellular mechanisms behind the sudden fall of the stimulated leaf and the role of permeability in the process. The study uses electric resistance measurements to determine the extent of permeability variation in intact plants and its impact on plant movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
