They introduce a modification to the method, the intra-atomic correlation correction, to account for the correlation between electrons closely associated in both the molecule and separated atoms. The study provides a more accurate analysis of the molecules' binding energies, wave functions, and dipole moments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
