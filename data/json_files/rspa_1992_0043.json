They express these solutions in terms of solutions of linear integral equations from the inverse scattering formalism for the nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation. The authors obtain exact \"bound state\" solutions for positive integer values of a parameter, which decay exponentially and are the first example of such solutions for the Painlev\u00e9 equations. They also derive a nonlinear recurrence relation for the equation relating two parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
