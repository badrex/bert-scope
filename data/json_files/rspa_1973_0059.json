They studied the stereochemistry, dipole moments, and low-energy photoelectron spectra of molecules like SiH3NCO, SiH3N3, and their carbon analogues. The results showed that although p-d bonding may play a significant role in the Si-N bond, it does not directly control the stereochemistry of silicon pseudohalides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Bonding"}
