They demonstrate this by tuning two violins and performing a Sonata, proving that the theory aligns with both modern practice and ancient Greek music. The author also explains how to divide notes into chromatic half-notes and suggests that further research could lead to the recovery of even smaller intervals used by ancient musicians.", "scientific_discipline": "Music > Music Theory"}
