They also explore the relationship between mantle convection currents, the Earth's core, and the lack of correlation between gravity fields and these currents. Additionally, they address the differences in crustal movement between oceanic and continental crust and the possibility of oceanic geosynclines.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
