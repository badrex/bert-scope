They found that blood can absorb oxygen independently of putrefaction and that the absorption of oxygen causes a change in the color of the blood. The author also investigated the presence of carbonic acid gas in the residual air and found that it was not present in significant amounts. These findings contribute to the understanding of the role of blood in respiration and animal heat regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
