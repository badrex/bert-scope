When a force is applied to the axis of a rotating disc, some of the momentum is converted into a rotational momentum in a plane perpendicular to the force's direction. This phenomenon causes the gyroscope to oscillate and can be used in various applications, such as improving the accuracy of navigational instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
