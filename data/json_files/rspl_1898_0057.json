Travers investigate argon and discover two new elements, neon and metargon, through the process of fractionation and spectroscopy. Neon has a low density and unique spectral properties, while metargon has similar atomic weight to argon but different properties. This discovery expands the understanding of the periodic table and the properties of these elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
