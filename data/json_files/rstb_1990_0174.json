The authors demonstrate the theory through models of reactions with important fertilizer materials, such as urea and rock phosphate, and a model of the diffusion and oxidation of ferrous iron in the rhizosphere of lowland rice. Experimental verifications of the models are provided, highlighting the importance of understanding soil diffusion for managing nutrient delivery to plant roots and mitigating pollution effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
