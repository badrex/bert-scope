The author examines the similarities and differences between the shells of modern cephalopods, such as Nautilus, Spirula, and Sepia, and explores how these structures have evolved over time. The study of these shells provides insights into the lives of both modern and extinct cephalopods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Invertebrate Zoology"}
