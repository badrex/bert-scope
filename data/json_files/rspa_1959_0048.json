They found a linear relationship between band intensity and Hammett factor of substituents, and analyzed the inductive and resonance effects of different groups. The results provide more data for understanding the influence of solvent medium on absorbing solute molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
