By examining the remanent magnetization of rocks from various geological periods, researchers were able to determine the polar wandering paths and reconstruct the northern hemisphere's pre-Triassic configuration. The study found that Europe and North America were closer together and in lower latitudes during these times. The findings support the hypothesis that the Earth's mean geomagnetic field is a geocentric dipole aligned with the present geographic axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
