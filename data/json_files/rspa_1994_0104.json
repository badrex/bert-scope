They developed a model for continuous distributions of steps and explored various problems, including infinite and semi-infinite distributions and traveling waves. This work complements previous studies on finite trains of ledges and offers new insights into the macroscopic diffusion models and transformation mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Partial Differential Equations"}
