They analyzed the absorption bands and confirmed the occurrence of free rotation, providing a more accurate assignment of vibration frequencies. Their findings contribute to the understanding of molecular structure and behavior in symmetrical top molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
