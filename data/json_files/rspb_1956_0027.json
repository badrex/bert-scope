They find that phospholipid synthesis is significantly depressed in copper-deficient rats due to a failure in the process of condensation of acyl CoA with \u03b1-glycerophosphate to form phosphatidic acids. This study aims to understand the metabolic disturbances that lead to demyelination of the central nervous system in disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
