They found that both intra- and extrafusal muscle fibers were innervated by autonomic nerves, with noradrenergic and cholinergic axons present in muscle spindles. The results provide evidence of direct autonomic innervation of muscle spindles and skeletal muscle fibers, which may have functional implications for muscle contractions and regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
