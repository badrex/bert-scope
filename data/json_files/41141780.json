They found that the maximum intensity of the horizontal needle occurred around 7 PM, while the time of minimum intensity was less defined, happening somewhat later in the morning. The study also showed that the daily variation was generally greater when the southern declination of the moon was greatest, and the sun's influence was less equivocal but more noticeable as it moved towards the northward.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
