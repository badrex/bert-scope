The study analyzes the excimer binding energy and other molecular parameters, providing insights into the photodimerization behavior of these compounds. The findings contribute to understanding the role of molecular interactions in the formation of excimers and photodimers in aromatic hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
