They found that the predominant mechanism involves the absorption of light by oxygen molecules, creating ozone which then produces halogen monoxides. Other possible mechanisms were explored and ruled out, concluding that 80% of halogen monoxides are produced via this primary mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Reaction mechanisms"}
