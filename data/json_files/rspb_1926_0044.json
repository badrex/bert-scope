They found that nerve tissue produces significant heat during stimulation, which requires extra oxygen and carbon dioxide elimination. The study also highlights the importance of accurate calibration and measurement techniques in neurophysiological research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
