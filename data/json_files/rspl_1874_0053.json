The author explains that when a metallic salt is dissolved in water, it does not necessarily decompose into an oxide and an acid or a compound of the metallic oxide with the acid. The author also examines the action of heat on the violet hydrated compounds of chromium, concluding that it is not a simple dissociation of water molecules or acid from base but a chemical decomposition resulting in a different class of salts with different generic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Salt chemistry"}
