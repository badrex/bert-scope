Four distinct reaction modes are found, including two stationary states and two oscillatory states. The oscillatory states are associated with leaner compositions and faster flow rates, exhibiting oscillatory cool flames and ignitions. The research reveals features of ethane oxidation that match predictions of simple thermal theories and others that result from complex thermokinetic interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
