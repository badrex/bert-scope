The researchers found that pituitary extract significantly reduces the secretion of acid juice stimulated by histamine and insulin. The extract also inhibits the volume of gastric juice, suggesting a role in regulating alimentary blood flow and secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
