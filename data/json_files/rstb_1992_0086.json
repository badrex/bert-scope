The shell is made up of thin, impersistent layers with a vertical canal system and organic strands. The basic unit of the shell is an apatitic granule with a chitino-proteinaceous coat, which is assembled and aggregated into spherules within the outer epithelium of the mantle. The shell's distinctiveness depends on the proportions of its organic and biomineral components and the aggregation of its apatitic mosaics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Invertebrate Zoology"}
