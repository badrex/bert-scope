The authors used a rocket-borne spectrograph to obtain spatially resolved profiles of the Mg II doublet spectral region, with a resolution limit of 1.6 pm. They found that solar activity has a significant influence on the recorded Mg II emission lines, and the results demonstrate the sensitivity of the Mg II lines to changes in chromospheric activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
