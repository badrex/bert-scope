The authors describe their main properties, including the effect of various factors on their activity, their reaction with molecular oxygen, and the reduction of hydrogen peroxide. They also examine the enzyme specificity and discuss the role of competitive inhibitors and secondary oxidation of p-phenylenediamine in these reactions."}
