They obtain expressions for the elastic and dielectric constants and infra-red absorption frequencies of non-pyroelectric crystals, focusing on diagonally cubic crystals like sodium chloride, cesium chloride, and zinc blende structures. The theory provides satisfactory agreement with experimental results for germanium and sodium iodide."}
