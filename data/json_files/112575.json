The nucleus was self-luminous and possibly made of ignited gas, while the coma reflected sunlight. The continuous spectrum of the coma's light suggested that it was made of fog or cloud-like matter. Huggins also found that the bright line in the spectrum of the comet corresponded to the brightest line of nitrogen, which might indicate that cometary matter is made of nitrogen or a more elementary substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comet spectroscopy"}
