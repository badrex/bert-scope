He found that seeds sown in moss took longer to mature but produced taller stems and more blades than those planted in soil. Additionally, cuttings and layers of vines planted in moss grew larger than those planted in the ground. This research suggests that moss could be a viable alternative to soil for plant cultivation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
