The author derives an equation that relates the osmotic pressure, vapour pressures, and hydrostatic pressures of the solution and solvent. The findings provide a deeper understanding of the behavior of volatile solutions and their equilibrium properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution chemistry"}
