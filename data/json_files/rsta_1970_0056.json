The study investigates the remanent magnetization of these formations and infers the direction of primary remanence in some cases. The findings suggest that a large part of the hard component of remanence was acquired after folding, and the magnetization was possibly acquired before the strata were folded at the end of the Mesozoic or in the Tertiary.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
