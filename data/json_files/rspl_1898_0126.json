They describe the process of dissecting mosquitoes and examining the pigmented bodies found in their stomach walls, which change in size and nature over time. The author also discusses the challenges faced in rearing mosquitoes and the impact of temperature on their feeding habits and the progression of the disease. The study provides valuable insights into the transmission of malaria and the role of mosquitoes in its spread.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
