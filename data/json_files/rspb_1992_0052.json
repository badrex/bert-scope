In particular, it looks at the interaction between the serotonergic Retzius (R) neuron and the pressure-sensitive (P) neuron in leeches. When these neurons are in contact, the P cell's response to serotonin is reduced, demonstrating the specificity of this interaction and the role of neuronal recognition during synapse formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
