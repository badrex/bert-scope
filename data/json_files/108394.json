He discovered that the membrana tympani consists of two distinct fibrous layers: the radiating fibrous lamina and the circular fibrous lamina. These layers are made up of tightly arranged fibers that provide support and stability to the ear's auditory system. Toynbee's findings differ from previous investigations, and he concludes that the membrana tympani is not a contractile tissue, as some had previously believed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human anatomy"}
