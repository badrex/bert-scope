It focuses on the mechanical behavior of thermotropic liquid crystals and assesses the progress in measuring their material parameters. The author discusses the static and dynamic theories, the energy balance, and the conservation of linear and angular momenta in nematic liquid crystals. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the material parameters and their impact on the behavior of liquid crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
