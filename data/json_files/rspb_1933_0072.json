It explores the role of circulation, the connection between the outer limbs of rods and visual purple, and the pigment epithelium in regeneration. The study uses tissue cultures of isolated retinas, developing retinas in vivo, vitamin A-deficient retinas, and retinas with rods out of contact with the pigment epithelium. The findings suggest that the formation of visual purple is associated with the survival and proper functioning of retinal cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
