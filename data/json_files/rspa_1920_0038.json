The gas could not be easily recovered by heating the splashed metal, suggesting that xenon might form compounds. Further experiments confirmed that xenon did not reappear when the metal splash was dissolved, leading the author to suggest that xenon might form compounds with other elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
