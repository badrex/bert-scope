They find that transient bubble size can be described by four parameters and that mass diffusion within the gas significantly limits the rate of the process. The results agree with experimental observations of nitrogen and helium bubbles in water. Translatory bubble motion also causes a significant growth rate when the bubble has been accelerated and a flow transition has occurred.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
