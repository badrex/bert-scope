Instead, it is influenced by an alternate process of exhaustion and restoration of excitability in responding tissues. The research also highlights the importance of lithocysts, which are rudimentary vision organs, and the polypite's ability to perform localized movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
