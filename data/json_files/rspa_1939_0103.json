The authors found that the friction coefficient between clean metals is much higher than that of metals with surface films. The presence of certain gases can reduce this friction, while others have little to no effect. The effect of temperature on the friction coefficient was also studied, showing a small but regular decrease as the temperature rises.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Science"}
