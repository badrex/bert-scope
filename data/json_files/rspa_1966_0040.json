They use X-ray analysis to determine the molecule's structure and find that it has strict planar symmetry. The molecule's carbon-carbon bond lengths are similar to those in benzene, and the authors discuss the implications of this finding for the molecule's delocalization and energy levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
