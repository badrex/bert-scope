The author traces the development of supersonic transport, highlighting the differences between subsonic and supersonic aerodynamics and the impact of speed, configuration, and powerplant choices. The lecture uses Concorde as an example of a practical supersonic transport and explores the development of its features and parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aerospace Engineering"}
