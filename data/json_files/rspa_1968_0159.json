The study uses soap bubbles and water drops to analyze the critical potential difference and the effect of the electric field on the drops' shape and behavior. The findings provide insights into the reaction between neighboring drops in an electric field and the conditions required for coalescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
