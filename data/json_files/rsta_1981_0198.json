The author analyzes observations made by telescopes, the International Ultraviolet Explorer Satellite, and the Pioneer and Voyager space probes. The article also explores the molecular hydrogen and helium abundance ratios, which provide insight into the original state and evolution of these atmospheres. The findings reveal a surprisingly close similarity between the weather systems of Earth and the giant planets, with both having internal heat sources and producing terrestrial-style weather systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Planetary Science"}
