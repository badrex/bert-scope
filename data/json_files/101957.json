The first plant, called the Silver Pine, has leaves covered in white silk-like hair and cones with seeds lodged between scales. The second plant has brown smooth bark, thickly set leaves with no foot-stalks, and fruit made up of many hard, red scales enclosing rudimentary seeds. These plants are of great interest for their beauty and for their potential to propagate and spread.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
