They found a wide variation in the distribution of flagellates and observed that the infection rate and type were not affected by temperature or the intensity of infection. The study aimed to understand the factors involved in the transmission of Mediterranean kala-azar.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
