They measured the susceptibility of paramagnetic salts, such as manganese ammonium sulphate and potassium chrome alum, to calculate the temperature and pressure. The results were compared with the theoretical scale calculated by Bleaney and Simon, showing a difference from the'scale 1937' of Schmidt and Keesom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
