They observe periodic errors and lattice faults in the crystal lattice, which cause diffuseness and elongation of spots in oscillation photographs. The authors discuss a possible explanation for these effects and analyze the diffraction patterns of the complex structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
