They discover that the presence of acids or alkalis in small concentrations can cause gluten to disperse into a colloidal solution, while salts can counteract this effect. The study provides insights into the role of electrolytes in the formation and stability of gluten, which is crucial for understanding dough properties and bread-making.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Chemistry"}
