They found that the quantum yield of molecular iodine increased with the presence of nitric oxide. The reaction mechanism involves the competition between reactions of methyl radicals with iodine molecules and nitric oxide to form nitrosomethane. The authors also investigated the effect of pressure on the rate of reaction and compared it with the reaction of methyl radicals with oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
