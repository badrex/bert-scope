They discovered that these minerals form a complex series of isomorphous structures, with some having both albite and anorthite structures. The authors propose a model in which sheets with the albite structure and sheets with the anorthite structure alternate, providing a more accurate understanding of the plagioclase felspar group's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Mineralogy"}
