They found that the electromotive force changes with the addition of different substances and that the minimum proportion of a substance required to upset the voltaic balance is very small. This research can be used as a test of chemical composition and to examine the state of combination when dissolved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
