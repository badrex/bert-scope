They applied this method to calculate dipole polarizabilities for low-lying singlet and triplet states of helium and other two-electron ions using well-correlated variational trial functions. The calculated values provide high-accuracy estimates and help evaluate the leading unknown terms in the expansion of the polarizability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
