The author explores various techniques for determining the overall response of electronic area-detectors and addresses the challenges of using different calibration wavelengths and the tails of the point-spread functions. The article provides insights into the integral response of area-detector diffractometers and the effects of illumination on calibration accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
