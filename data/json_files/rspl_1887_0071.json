Thore's Supposed \"New Force\" and Its Relation to Molecular Bombardment", "semantic_tags": ["Molecular physics", "Thermodynamics", "Radiant heat", "Molecular attraction and repulsion", "Experimental physics"], "tldr": "The author, William Crookes, investigates M. J. Thore's claim of a new force and conducts experiments to understand its nature. Crookes finds that the rotation of cylinders is due to molecular bombardment and attraction or repulsion between heated bodies, rather than a new force inherent in the human organism. The experiments demonstrate that air currents and other environmental factors do not cause the observed rotations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Molecular physics"}
