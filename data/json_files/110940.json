He found that the organization of these animalcules, mainly Xanthidia and Rotalia, is simple and has no relation to Cephalopoda. The shells of these creatures are polythalamous and have pores for tentacles and transparent feelers for locomotion. The digestive organs are composed of bladders or sacs connected by a tube. This research contributes to the understanding of Foraminifera fossilization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
