They propose that the disease is caused by a ferment produced by the Bacillus diphtherias, which digests the proteins in the body, leading to the formation of albumoses and an organic acid. This poison causes fever, paralysis, and nerve degeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pathology"}
