The author discovers that the distinction between these sounds is based on resonance in the mouth, with or without a difference in air pressure. The study also shows that the essential difference between voiced and unvoiced consonants is produced in the pharyngeal or laryngeal regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Linguistics > Phonetics"}
