Alpha cells have the largest somata and large dendritic fields, and they are stratified into inner and outer subpopulations. These cells are associated with brisk-transient or Y-receptive fields, suggesting that this physiological system is a basic feature of placental mammalian retinas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
