They classify these films into \"liquid expanded films\" and \"vapour expanded films\" based on their cohesion and behavior. The study provides insights into the area per molecule, surface vapor pressure, and thermal expansion of expanded films, and reveals that the area at no compression is almost constant for liquid expanded films with single-chain molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
