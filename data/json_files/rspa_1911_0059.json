Stoney's work, which predates the discovery of inert gases, suggests a logarithmic spiral as a representation of atomic weights and chemical elements. The paper discusses the curve plotted to rectangular coordinates and the sudden transition between electro-positive and electro-negative states, which may be connected to the vacant places in the periodic table later occupied by inert gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Theory"}
