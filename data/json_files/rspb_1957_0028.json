The author demonstrates that these changes can be reversible and are not due to total loss of self-reproducing elements or their function. The findings suggest that direct action of natural selection on the cytoplasm plays a role in adjusting phenotypes in the fungus, providing flexibility for adaptation to its environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Fungal Biology"}
