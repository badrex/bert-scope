The authors identify four possible flow structures or modes at the interface, which change based on parameters such as total fluid depths, depth ratios, and gravity levels. The study has applications to liquid-encapsulated crystal growth, where convection can affect the homogeneity of the crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
