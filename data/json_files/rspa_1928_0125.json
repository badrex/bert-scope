They discovered that transfer resistance is independent of electrolyte concentration and is influenced by the electrode surface and gas liberation. The authors concluded that transfer resistance is the electrical resistance of a gas film covering the electrode surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
