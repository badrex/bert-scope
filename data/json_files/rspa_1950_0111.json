The research finds that microseismic waves from different sources can be distinguished by frequency analysis, and the two-to-one ratio between wave and microseism periods supports the theory that microseisms are produced by wave interference. The findings suggest that microseismic activity at a particular observatory can be caused by multiple sources, including coastal and distant wave interference.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
