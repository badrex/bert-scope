The instrument consists of a small lens, a scale of equal parts, and a telescope-like structure. By comparing the magnified image of an object with the scale, one can determine its dimensions with great accuracy. This micrometer can be used in various fields, including astronomy and engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Measurement instruments"}
