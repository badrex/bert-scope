They found that most materials emit considerable amounts of electricity when heated to high temperatures, with some materials, like carbon, showing a high degree of electrical emission. The study also found that the introduction of substances like alkaline earths, metals, and oxides into a hot furnace led to increased ionization currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
