They developed a four-stage mechanism for erosion in Stellite 6, involving matrix deformation, cracking at carbide-matrix boundaries, crack intersection, and material removal. The study also compared the erosion resistance of cast and wrought forms of the alloy, with the wrought form (Haynes 6B) showing better homogeneity and suitability for detailed metallographic analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
