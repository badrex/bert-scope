They found that the displacement vector for {13#x305;2} faults is R2 = [x2,1 +?, y'2, z2], and for {101} faults, it is R2 = [1 + x2, y'2, 1 + z2]. These findings help in understanding the structure and properties of rutile crystals and their defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
