The severity of haemolytic anaemia in mice depends on the dose of anti-mouse haemolytic antiserum administered. The presence of non-immune sera in the antiserum reduces the amount of rabbit antibody that reaches the circulation, but not just by dilution. The extent of this effect depends on the specificity of the non-immune sera and their proportion in the ingested mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
