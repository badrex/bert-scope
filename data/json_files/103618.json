He demonstrates that the force of a moving body is proportional to its mass multiplied by its velocity, rather than the square of its velocity as Polenus proposed. Dr. Desaguliers provides several experiments to support his findings, showing that the force is directly related to the mass and velocity of the moving object. This work contributes to the understanding of mechanics and the relationship between force, mass, and velocity."}
