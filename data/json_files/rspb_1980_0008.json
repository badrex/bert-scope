Prolonged peripheral light stimulation induces diverse sustained feedback effects, including complex long depolarizations, prolonged increases in electrical excitability, and sustained oscillations. These effects are blocked by cone hyperpolarization and Ca2+ channel-blocking agents and are associated with an increase in membrane Ca2+ conductance. The study demonstrates that the feedback effects of L-horizontal cells on cones are not only transient but also sustained.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
