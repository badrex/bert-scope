The author observes that disease in the ovarium and oviduct leads to a change in feather appearance, and that this change is more common in younger birds. The author also discusses the effects of artificial operations on the sexual organs of both male and female chickens, and how these operations can lead to changes in plumage and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
