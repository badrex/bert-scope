The study focuses on the focusing effects, non-linear features, and discontinuities of the velocity gradient in supersonic flow fields. The method provides a qualitative and quantitative understanding of supersonic flow fields and helps predict limit lines and the formation of shockwaves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
