The authors describe the synthesis of doubly protected \u03b1-dibenzyl \u03b1-amino aldehydes and their reactions with Grignard reagents, lithium enolates, and other organometallic reagents. They found that these reactions exhibit high diastereoselectivity and non-chelation control, which can be explained by molecular modeling and the Felkin-Anh model. This method allows for the effective exploitation of the chiral pool of amino acids in organic synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
