The authors used 13C and 31P NMR to observe the metabolic pathways and effects of thyroid hormones on rats. They found that thyroid hormone treatment increased the rate of glycerol consumption and glucose formation in liver cells from hyperthyroid rats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Metabolism and Biochemistry"}
