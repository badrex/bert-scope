They found that the bands of molecules like carotene and vitamin A concentrates become sharper and develop more structure at lower temperatures, which helps in recognizing and distinguishing between different molecules. This technique can be useful in analyzing the molecular structure and identifying impurities in biological molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
