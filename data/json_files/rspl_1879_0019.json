They discovered that potassium hyposulphite is a product of combustion of gunpowder. The authors argue that any attempt to express the chemical reactions of gunpowder in a single equation would be misleading and not accurately represent the complexity of the reactions. They also discuss the objections raised by other scientists, such as General Morin and M. Berthelot, and provide their own explanations for the chemical changes involved in the explosion of gunpowder.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
