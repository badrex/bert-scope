It explains the basic principles of quasiperiodicity and the hyperspace concept, which allows for the understanding of quasicrystal structures through periodic approximants and projection methods. The article also discusses the atomic modeling and structure determination of quasicrystals using diffraction data and the hyperspace scheme.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
