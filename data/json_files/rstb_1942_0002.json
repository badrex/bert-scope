The study reveals that British starlings have a more accelerated growth rate in their gonads compared to Continental birds. These differences are reflected in the accessory sexual organs and secondary sexual characters. The author also discusses the behavior of the two races of birds and proposes renaming the British race of starlings as Sturnus vulgaris britannicus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Ornithology"}
