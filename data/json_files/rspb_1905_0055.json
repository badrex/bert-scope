They found that natural processes and certain types of manures cause the loss of calcium carbonate, an essential substance in the soil. The study was conducted on the Rothamsted experimental plots, which have been receiving the same manures for over fifty years. The findings have implications for understanding soil health and agricultural practices.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
