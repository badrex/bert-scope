They used a premixed propane-oxygen flame and found that the technique they developed can yield accurate refractive indices of soot under flame conditions. This research is important for radiative transfer calculations and in situ oxidation and growth studies of soot particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
