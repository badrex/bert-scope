They used a high-energy resolution setup and observed resonance phenomena in the scattering ratio for different -particle energies. This research helped to understand the conditions required to observe resonance in scattering experiments and provided insights into nuclear structure and particle physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
