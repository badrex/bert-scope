They found that the discharge traveled perpendicularly to the applied fields in ethane gas near the Paschen minimum along ski-shaped electrodes. The experimental results were compared with two models, showing good agreement. This study opens up new areas for research on Townsend discharges and correlates successfully with magnetic arc movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
