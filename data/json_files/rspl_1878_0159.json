Thollon's direct vision spectroscope for laboratory use, combining precise measurements with excellent definition. They also study the light-emitting properties of various crystals, such as diamond, ruby, and sapphire, and discuss the relationship between molecular phosphorescence and crystalline structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
