This method allows for the detection of minute amounts of HCN and has applications in studying the effects of anaesthetics on living organisms. The author also found that the evolution of hydrocyanic acid is a sign of loss of life rather than a sign of life, as previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
