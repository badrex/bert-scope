They apply the theory to a problem involving thin shells and use numerical integration to calculate the state of deformation throughout the inflated diaphragm. The Mooney form is employed for the stored-energy function, simplifying the calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
