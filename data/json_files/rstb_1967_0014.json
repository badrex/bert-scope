It explores the effects of climate, geology, and edaphic factors on the distribution of vegetation in the area. The study focuses on the different subformations of the Antarctic Cryptogam Formation, including lichen and moss cushion communities, and their habitats, such as cliffs and stony ground. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the climate and vegetation in the Maritime Antarctic for future research and conservation efforts.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
