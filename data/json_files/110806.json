They mention that Hisinger, Berzelius, and Faraday attribute this process to the liberation of hydrogen, while Davy and others believe it results from the metal's attraction to the negative pole. The author also demonstrates that the reduction of metals can occur through the action of hydrogen contained in a tube with a piece of platinized platina in contact with the metallic salt.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
