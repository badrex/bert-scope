They found that the non-gravid uterus in pregnancy takes up a fraction of the injected dose, with appearance of labelled protein in the maternal bloodstream. The study also suggests that proteins are taken up by the foetal cell equally, with a small part passing on into the foetal circulation as protein and the remainder being broken down.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
