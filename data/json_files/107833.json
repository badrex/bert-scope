He used various needles and recorded their vibrations to determine the magnetic intensity in both cities. The results showed that the horizontal intensity in London was greater than in Paris by about 11 parts in a thousand. This study helped to understand the differences in magnetic forces between the two cities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
