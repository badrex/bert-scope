They found that these detergents cause a CO-shift towards shorter wavelengths and that haem a combines more strongly with Emasol than with other compounds. This research helps to understand the relationship between haem a compounds and cytochromes of group a.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry", "sub_discipline": "Molecular Biology > Protein Structure and Function"}
