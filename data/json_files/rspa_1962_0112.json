They found that nitrous oxide influences the reactions and can produce nitrogen gas. The results provide insights into the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions and the potential for using nitrous oxide to study isotope effects in neutral and alkaline solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiation Chemistry"}
