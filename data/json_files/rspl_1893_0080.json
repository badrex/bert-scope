They found that the heliotropic effects of flashing light were much greater than expected and that there was no chlorophyll formation during these experiments. This research suggests that flashing light may have a unique influence on plant growth and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
