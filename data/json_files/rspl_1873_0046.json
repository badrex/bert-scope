They establish a relationship between the cardiosystole, sphygmosystole, and pulse-beat, and introduce the concept of \"syspasis,\" the time taken by the ventricle to elevate its internal pressure before the aortic valve opens. The author also describes the use of a double sphygmograph to measure the time taken for pulse-waves to travel between different arteries.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
