These include the proposal that dark matter in rich clusters of galaxies is mainly baryonic, the implications of decay photons as a solution to the ratio problem, and strong supporting evidence from observations with the Hubble Space Telescope. The decaying neutrino theory could help explain the ionization of the intergalactic medium and the concentration of dark matter in clusters of galaxies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
