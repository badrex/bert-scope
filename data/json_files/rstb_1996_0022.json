The frontal eye, a putative photoreceptor, could be homologous with the lateral paired eyes of vertebrates. The visual system of amphioxus larvae is more like that of vertebrates than previously recognized, providing important clues about the basic organization and subdivision of the vertebrate brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
