They found that the isobaric thermal expansions and isothermal compressibilities are anisotropic, and the effect of applying pressure at ambient temperature is not equivalent to lowering the temperature at ambient pressure. The results provide insights into the structural phase transition and the electrical transport properties of the compound.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
