They found that the stability of TYMV capsids is due to strong protein-protein interactions, while EMV capsids have less hydrophobic interactions. The authors also discovered that cytosine residues in the RNA play a crucial role in the assembly of TYMV capsids, and that the capsid may be a precursor in tymovirus morphogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
