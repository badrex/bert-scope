The amount of directional asymmetry was positively related to the expression of secondary sexual characters, suggesting that males with the largest degree of asymmetry had a selective advantage due to higher mating success. This relation was not confounded by variables such as body mass, body size, and age.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
