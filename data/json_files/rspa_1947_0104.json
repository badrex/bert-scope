They found that the molecules consist of two chemically identical halves and that the liquid of crystallization does not penetrate the molecules, leaving their structure unaffected. The study provides valuable information on the shape, dimensions, and internal structure of the haemoglobin molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
