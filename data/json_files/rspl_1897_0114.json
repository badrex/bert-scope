They discovered that the effective thickness for total reflection decreases with an increase in the angle of incidence and increases with the wavelength of the incident electric radiation. The study also showed that the minimum effective thickness is dependent on the refractive index of the refracting substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
