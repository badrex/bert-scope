For algebraically special vacuum background space-times, explicit formulae are given in terms of derivatives of the scalar potential. The study of linearized perturbations in relativity theory is significantly lightened by this concept. The article also presents a generalization of Penrose's treatment of the electromagnetic field to a curved vacuum space-time, confirming previous results and providing new insights.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
