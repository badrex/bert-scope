The author constructs the moduli space and its associated metric using the Toda equation, which is integrable for these algebras. The article focuses on the construction of hyperbolic vortices and their moduli spaces, providing a deeper understanding of the mathematical and physical properties of these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
