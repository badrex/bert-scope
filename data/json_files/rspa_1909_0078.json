E. H. Tutton developed a wave-length comparator for comparing standards of length, such as the Imperial Standard Yard, using the principle of interferometry. The instrument is the first specifically designed for this purpose and is also the most precise for measuring in wavelengths. The comparator's essential point is the movement of interference bands, which is equal to half the wavelength of the light used. The author describes the electrical and thermal arrangements and the foundation masonry of the new comparator room, which maintains a constant temperature of 62\u00b0F.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
