They used various liquids and different types of sound sources to measure the streaming velocity and absorption coefficients. The results showed that the relationship between streaming and absorption persists into the region below 1 kHz, and the author hopes to obtain more results in the intermediate range using magneto-striction generators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
