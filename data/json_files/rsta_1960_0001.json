They introduce matrix operators and difference operations, and demonstrate their application to initial-value and boundary-value problems. The methods are illustrated through small-scale examples, but the authors believe they can be efficiently handled by modern high-speed digital computers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra"}
