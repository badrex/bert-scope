The authors examine the two-center expansion in atomic eigenfunctions and evaluate cross-sections for various reactions. They find that cross-sections may be substantially increased by passage through intermediate states for incident energies less than about 10, tending towards equality with a decrease in relative velocity. The results obtained for symmetrical resonance reactions are in good agreement with the two-state solutions of McCarroll (1961).", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
