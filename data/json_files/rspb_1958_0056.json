While these chemicals reduced sperm activity and affected fertilization rates, only a few haploid or near-haploid embryos were found, and their gynogenetic nature was not confirmed. The results contrast with those obtained for amphibians.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
