The author, J. Clerk Maxwell, conducted a series of experiments using a spectrometer and found that the experimental curve for the Iceland Spar's optical properties lies outside Huygens' ellipse, indicating a deviation from the existing theory. The study suggests that the surface of wavefronts in Iceland Spar might not be an ellipse but an oval curve.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
