They demonstrate that the effective compliance tensor of a composite material remains unchanged when the constituent moduli are shifted uniformly. This property explains why the effective Young's modulus of a two-dimensional medium with holes does not depend on the Poisson's ratio of the matrix material.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
