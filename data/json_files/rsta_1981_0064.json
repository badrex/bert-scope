The authors analyze the geochemistry of marginal basin basalts and associated island arc lavas, discussing the nature of their sources and the processes involved in magma genesis. They also explore the implications of these findings for marginal basin development and the potential role of water and lithophile elements from the downgoing slab in the formation of back-arc basalts.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
