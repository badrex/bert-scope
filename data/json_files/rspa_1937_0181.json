They used improved techniques and equipment to record and analyze wave forms at different locations. Their findings revealed that the wave forms and their temporal incidence were influenced by the distance between the observing station and the discharge channel. This research contributed to the understanding of atmospheric phenomena and their impact on radio signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
