They also discuss the distribution of open times, shut times, and burst lengths following a perturbation, such as a voltage jump. The presence or absence of a component with a unit mean in the distribution of the number of openings per burst can provide information about the connections between the system's states.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ion Channel Biology"}
