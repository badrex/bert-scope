They discovered that irradiation of methyl methacrylate by ultra-violet light produces a catalyst, while a thermal reaction forms an inhibitor. These findings explain the difficulties experienced by other researchers and account for the anomalous polymerization observed by Melville. The authors also investigated chain termination in the polymerization of styrene and methyl methacrylate, showing that it occurs through disproportionation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
