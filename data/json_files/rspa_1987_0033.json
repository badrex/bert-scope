The analysis predicts these shifts, which are now becoming measurable, and considers the effects of fine structure and hyperfine structure. The study focuses on two extreme cases: low orbital angular momenta and very high orbital angular momenta. The article provides explicit formulae for the non-retarded regime and rough predictions for the retarded regime for low orbital angular momenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
