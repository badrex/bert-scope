C. Chibnall discusses the structure of proteins, specifically lactoglobulin and egg-albumin, as systems of peptide chains. The molecule of lactoglobulin consists of eight or nine peptide chains, while egg-albumin has four chains. The conclusion is based on titration data and the estimation of free amino-N, with new suggestions for how the peptide chains are linked together.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
