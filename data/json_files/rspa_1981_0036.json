The author reconsiders Liepmann's proposal for calculating aerodynamic sound generated by a turbulent boundary layer and applies the theory to the interaction of a mean flow with wall cavities, slots in aerofoils, and leading and trailing edges of splitter plates. The study challenges the currently accepted explanation of organ pipe operation and provides a new perspective on the exchange of energy between a mean flow and an acoustic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
