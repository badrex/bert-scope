They clarify the differences and equivalences between the Lagrange, Gibbs-Appell, and their own equations, emphasizing that all are different yet equivalent ways of stating D'Alembert's principle. They also address Bucy's incorrect statements about Gauss's principle and the importance of their work in providing useful results for practical situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mechanics"}
