They investigated the metabolism of these acids in wheat coleoptile and pea-stem tissues, and their findings suggest that the enzymes involved in the degradation of these compounds show substrate specificity. The results provide insights into the relationship between the structure of these compounds and their biological activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
