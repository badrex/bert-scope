They determined the absolute temperature down to 0.01 K and found the Curie point at 0.7 K. The results were compared with theory and showed good agreement above the Curie point. The study enabled a comparison between the Curie points of two alums differing only in their monovalent cations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
