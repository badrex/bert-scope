Valorous. They discuss temperature measurements taken at various depths and analyze the data to identify distinct layers of water with different temperatures and movements. The findings suggest the existence of a superheated layer, a neutral intermediate layer, and a deep cold layer, all of which contribute to the understanding of ocean currents and water movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
