The author explores the role of thermal factors, the physical state of the material, and the presence of defects or discontinuities in the solid. The article also examines the propagation of low-velocity detonation in solids and the influence of factors such as impurities, diluents, and crystal defects on the detonation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid State Chemistry"}
