The research examines the resin canals in various parts of the plant, including roots, stems, and branches, and explores their formation and distribution in response to wounding. The findings provide insights into the importance of resin canals in conifer classification, identification, and phylogeny.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
