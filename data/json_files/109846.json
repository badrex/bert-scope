He discovers that the optical effects of heated glass depend on the progressive differences of temperature in different parts of the plate. Brewster also finds that these phenomena are similar to those exhibited by crystallized bodies, suggesting a crystalline structure in the glass during contact with heated iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
