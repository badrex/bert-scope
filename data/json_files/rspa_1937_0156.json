The authors analyze the behavior of different control systems and their parameters, using the differential analyser to obtain solutions and compare their effectiveness. They find that certain control laws offer more freedom of choice and provide better control in terms of stability and design.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Control Theory"}
