The machine, consisting of disk, globe, and cylinder integrators, was designed to determine the mean and coefficients of temperature variations. The harmonic analyser significantly improved the efficiency of data analysis, reducing the need for laborious measurement and calculation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
