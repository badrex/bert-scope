The authors compare their findings with previous research and demonstrate that the most germicidal region of the ultra-violet spectrum lies between wave-lengths 2940 and 2380. They also highlight the correlation between germicidal action and the selective absorption of lethal radiations by suspensions of bacteria, solutions of protein, and other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Bacteriology"}
