They found that the temperature of the crater decreased with increased pressure and increased with reduced pressure. This suggests that the temperature of the sun's photosphere may be higher than previously thought, as high pressure is not the only factor affecting the temperature of the electric arc.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
