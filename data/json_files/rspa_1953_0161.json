They develop a theory for the slow collapse of cylindrical and spherical holes in a medium with non-Newtonian viscosity and apply it to tunnel observations in the Alps and Norway. The study provides a better understanding of the flow laws of ice and its implications for glacier movement and tunnel collapse.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
