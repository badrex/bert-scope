They found that atmospheric air acquires carbonic acid when in contact with venous blood, which supports the idea that carbonic acid already exists in the blood and is extracted by the atmospheric air. The author also discusses the role of the lungs and body temperature in promoting these changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
