The authors review the effectiveness of organic geochemical and petrological parameters in estimating coalification and assess the applicability of microscopical parameters in ranking organic matter. They emphasize the importance of vitrinite reflectance as a key estimator of coalification and discuss factors influencing the optical properties of vitrinites, such as temperature, time, static pressure, and stress. The authors provide examples of how vitrinite reflectance can be used in various geological applications, including the assessment of rank, burial histories of basins, and timing of coalification in relation to orogenesis and igneous activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Organic Petrology"}
