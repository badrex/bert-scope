The nonlinear stability boundary found is in close agreement with experimental results, and it provides an estimate of the critical amplitude threshold for any sub-critical instabilities that may occur. The stability is conditional, and the use of energy theory in this way was first developed by Joseph & Hung (1971).", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
