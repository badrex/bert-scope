They deduced the mean energies removed per downward step for different gases and found that these results agree better with data from \"fall off\" of unimolecular reactions than with chemical activation studies. The study provides insights into the quenching efficiency of various gases and the role of intermolecular forces in the relaxation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
