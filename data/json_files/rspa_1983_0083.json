By plotting the logarithm of frequency against an additive variate scale, the author reveals that many random distributions have straight-line asymptotes and are not symmetrical, challenging the widely accepted Gaussian distribution. The author suggests that a single natural process may govern random distributions, and deviations may be due to systematic tendencies or mixed distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
