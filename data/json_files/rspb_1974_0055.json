The smooth muscle cells have a high surface-to-volume ratio, irregular shapes, and a high density of innervation. The research provides insights into the peculiar characteristics of this muscle and its potential implications for understanding smooth muscle structures in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
