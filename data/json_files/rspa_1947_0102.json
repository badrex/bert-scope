A. Coulson and H. C. Longuet-Higgins presents the general theory of conjugated systems using molecular orbitals. They discuss the energy and distribution of mobile electrons, the secular equations, and the significance of Coulomb and resonance integrals. The authors also explain the calculation of total energy, electron densities, bond orders, and mutual polarizabilities in conjugated systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
