They found that dinitro-o-cresol significantly increased the metabolic level of the ventral ectoderm, but not the dorsal lip region. This study provides insights into the relationship between metabolic activity and physiological and morphogenetic states in developing organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
