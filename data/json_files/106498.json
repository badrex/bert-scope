He discovered that inflammable air, which he believed to be the same as phlogiston, could be converted into other types of air through chemical reactions. This research challenged the prevailing phlogiston theory and contributed to the development of modern chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and equilibrium"}
