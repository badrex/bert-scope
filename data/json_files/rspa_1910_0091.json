They analyze the sensation curves of incomplete color-blind eyes and find that the place of maximum luminosity travels in the case of red-blindness from Standard Scale No. 49 to 46. By comparing the luminosity of the spectral colors, the author concludes that the trichromatic theory holds true and can be used to approximate the amount of red and green sensation deficient in incomplete color-blind eyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Color Perception"}
