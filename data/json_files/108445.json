The results showed that tadpoles can develop in the absence of light, but their development is affected by temperature. The author also studied the respiration and nutrition of tadpoles, discovering that they require both the gelatin of the ova and plants growing in the water for proper growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
