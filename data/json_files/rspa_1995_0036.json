They investigate the existence of solutions and the effects of upstream and downstream boundary conditions on the flow geometry. The research aims to determine the criteria for vortex breakdown and the constraints imposed by inlet conditions for a given geometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
