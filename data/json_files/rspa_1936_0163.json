The expression includes the electromagnetic mass term, radiation pressure term, and higher-order terms related to the sphere's radius. The author applies this expression to cases of continuous uniform acceleration and hyperbolic rectilinear motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrodynamics"}
