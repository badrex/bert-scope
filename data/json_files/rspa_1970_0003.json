The research uses optical methods, such as cine-interferometry and particle tracking, to investigate the heat release rate-temperature relation and compare it with flame structure analysis. The findings reveal a constant activation energy of 8.8 kcal and differ from heat release rate laws in equivalent premixed flat flames, providing insights into predicting ignition in flow systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
