The study traces the development of the lake and its catchment area, discussing vegetational change and the impact of cultural activities on the lake's eutrophication. The research also explores the sediment accumulation rates, diatom influx, and the emergence of Stephanodiscus as the most important diatom genus in the eutrophication stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
