These habitats have influenced the evolution and distribution of plant species in the region. The effects of Pleistocene climatic changes on the balance between savanna and rainforest are also discussed, highlighting the importance of these habitats as islands for the evolution of plant species.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Biogeography"}
