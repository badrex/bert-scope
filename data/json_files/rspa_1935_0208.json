They present a method to calculate the probability of this transition and the effective cross-section for pair creation, considering the effect of screening and the dependence on impact parameter. This work contributes to the understanding of particle interactions and the development of particle accelerators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
