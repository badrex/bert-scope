The replication process requires the large-tumor antigen (T antigen) and extracts from cells that support replication in vivo. The host DNA polymerase \u03b1-primase complex plays a crucial role in discriminating between polyoma T antigen and SV40 T antigen-dependent replication of their homologous DNA. The study reconstitutes the replication process with purified components, including HeLa DNA polymerase \u03b1-primase complex, eukaryotic topoisomerase I, and a single-strand DNA binding protein."}
