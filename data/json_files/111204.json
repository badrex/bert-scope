F. Baxter, conducted experiments to determine if electrical currents are present during the process of assimilation in living animals' muscular and nervous tissues. The experiments were inspired by Matteucci's work and aimed to create a circuit between the muscular tissue and the venous blood. The results supported Matteucci's findings, indicating that the tissues were in opposite electric states.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
