Fothergill observed the effects of extreme cold on various liquids and atmospheric conditions. He found that lemon juice, vinegar, and red port-wine turned into solid ice, while spirits and ethers showed signs of freezing. The intense cold also caused a temporary disappearance of an epidemic cold and other diseases. This study provides valuable insights into the impact of extreme weather on human health and the behavior of substances under freezing conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Weather"}
