They found that both types of horizontal cells are in contact with at least 80% of the cones above their dendritic fields. The different horizontal cell classes cannot be selective for a specific type of cone, as they have at least 60% of the cone input in common. Each A-type horizontal cell makes contacts with between 120 and 170 cones, while B-type horizontal cells make contacts with 60-90 cones. The study provides insights into the connectivity and convergence of cones to horizontal cells in the cat retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
