The research shows that only grit particles with melting-points above a threshold value between 400-560\u00b0C can sensitize the explosives to initiation, while particles with lower melting-points do not have the same effect. The findings provide evidence that the initiation of solid explosives is due to the formation of localized hot spots, which are influenced by the grit's melting-point rather than its hardness.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
