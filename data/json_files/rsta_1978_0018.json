The research utilizes tephrochronology to analyze the thickness, grain size, and composition of volcanic deposits, providing valuable insights into the scale and style of volcanic activity. The three main stratovolcanoes on the island, Sete Cidades, Agua de Pau, and Furnas, have a long history of explosive eruptions, with trachytic pumice fall deposits accounting for more than half of their visible bulk. The island's wet-temperate climate allows for the preservation of a remarkably complete record of these eruptions, making Sao Miguel an ideal location for tephrochronological study.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
