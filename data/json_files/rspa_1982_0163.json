The author uses perturbation methods to determine the stability properties of equilibrium configurations and compares the results with Benjamin's experimental observations. The study provides insights into the influence of end effects in the Taylor vortex problem and the possible types of flows in finite cylinders.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
