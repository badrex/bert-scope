They focused on the vertical boundary layer structure near the corners of the cavity and analyzed the implications for the core flow. The results showed that the core stream function and core temperature approach zero as the Darcy-Rayleigh number increases, indicating that the vertical boundary layers empty into the core. This finding contradicts previous suggestions in the literature about the corner behavior of these flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
