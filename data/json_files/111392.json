They found that the reaction between siliceous matters and carbonates of lime, magnesia, and iron in sedimentary deposits, combined with the solvent action of a small portion of alkali, leads to the formation of serpentines, talcs, pyroxenites, chlorites, and garnet rocks. This process is essential in the transformation of sedimentary rocks, which are mainly composed of earthy carbonates, siliceous, aluminous, and felspathic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Metamorphism"}
