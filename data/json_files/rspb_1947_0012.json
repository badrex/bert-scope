Through selective breeding, laboratory production allowed the distribution of 889 million parasites over the spruce sawfly-infested area in Canada. The study found that selection in breeding lines led to a continuous decrease in the number of sterile males, an increase in the mean number of offspring per mother, and a reduction in variability of development, oviposition, and adult life length.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
