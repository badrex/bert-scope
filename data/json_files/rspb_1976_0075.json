The research shows that the modal interval and geometric standard deviation of interval distributions vary systematically with the state of arousal in cats. These findings provide a comparative measure of an animal's state of alertness and can help in understanding the differences in neuronal activity during sleep and wakefulness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
