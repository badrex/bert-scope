They identified the displacement vector of the stacking faults and found that they are intrinsic. The tetrahedra are thought to be stacking faults on all four {111} planes, resulting from the dissociation of Frank sessile loops formed by vacancy condensation on {111} planes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
