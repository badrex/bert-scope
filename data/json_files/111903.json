He found that amidobenzoic acid is identical to salylic acid and that it has a unique position in the group of aromatic acids, being the true representative of acetic acid. This discovery sheds light on the isomerism in the group of fatty acids and the chemical properties of salylic acid and its derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
