They explain how solar aspect sensors and glint observations from ground stations help in calculating the spin axis direction and coning angle of the satellite. The technique provides accurate results and eliminates the need for telemetry channels for solar aspect data transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Space Technology"}
