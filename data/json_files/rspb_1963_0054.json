They found that these granules, which contain oxytocin and vasopressin, are mainly membrane-bounded with a diameter of about 1300 \u00c5. The study provides insights into the storage and release mechanisms of hormones in the neurohypophysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
