It highlights how increased acid input and other reactions resulting from changed pH conditions have a greater impact on freshwater ecosystems than the increased input of S and N compounds themselves. The article also summarizes the effects on various organisms, including macrophytes, periphyton, phytoplankton, and zooplankton, and the changes in their species composition and community structure due to acidification.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
