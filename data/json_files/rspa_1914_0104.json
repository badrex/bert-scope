They also confirmed the electromagnetic force field theory, which explains the origin of absorption in these ketones, and disproved the molecular vibration theory. The study highlights the importance of using pure ketones in absorption measurements to obtain accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
