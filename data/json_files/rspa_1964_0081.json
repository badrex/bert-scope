The authors found that both types of gels exhibit similar features in their sedimentation curves, but with important differences. Agar gels show a well-defined gel/solvent interface, while gelatin gels have a higher proportion of gelatin in true solution, sedimenting more slowly than the gel interface. The results provide insights into the structure and properties of gels, which are increasingly used in techniques like zone electrophoresis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Biophysics"}
