They found that allowance for momentum transfer decreases the cross-section by 5% at 2, 16% at 6, and 45% at 20. The results are in satisfactory agreement with experimental data in the lower energy range, where capture into excited states is less important.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
