They find that Tmesipteris shares several characteristics with the extinct Sphenophyllales, such as dichotomous division of leaves, sporophylls more elaborate than vegetative leaves, multiple synangia on a single sporophyll, and the presence of a special ventral lobe of the leaf as a sporangiophore.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
