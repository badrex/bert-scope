They find that these salts exhibit unique morphological and physical properties compared to other salts in the series. The study focuses on the differences in facial angles, refractive indices, and molecular refraction between thallium salts and those containing alkali metals or ammonium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
