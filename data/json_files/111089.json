The author, John Tomes, examines the teeth of over sixty rodent species and identifies specific structural peculiarities that distinguish them from other mammalian teeth. He also discovers that the enamel in rodent teeth has a lamelliform arrangement, which varies between different groups of rodents. This research helps to establish a better understanding of the dental structures in rodents and supports the classification of these animals into different groups based on their teeth."}
