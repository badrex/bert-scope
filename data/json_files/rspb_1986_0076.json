They found that the presence of troponin-tropomyosin in the presence of calcium increases the affinity of myosin subfragment 1 for actin sixfold. Kinetic studies revealed an isomerization of the actin-subfragment 1 complex, which is affected by the presence of troponin-tropomyosin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Contraction"}
