It reviews various models, including galactic models with halo and disk structures, and metagalactic models with universal and local components. The article emphasizes the importance of answering key questions about cosmic-ray trapping regions, sources, propagation, and acceleration mechanisms to better understand the origin of these high-energy particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
