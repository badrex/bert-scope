They found that these media absorb different parts of the spectrum, which can affect photography and other applications. The authors also discovered that green glass, which is used in thermometer bulbs, does not completely absorb infra-red rays, and they suggest looking for other coloring materials for this purpose.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
