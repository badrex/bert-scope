The authors focus on the importance of spatial, temporal, and energetic disorder in these systems, and explore the implications of these concepts for understanding the behavior of chemical reactions in random media. They present several models for disorder and demonstrate how these models can be used to predict and explain complex decay patterns in reactions occurring in fractal and ultrametric spaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
