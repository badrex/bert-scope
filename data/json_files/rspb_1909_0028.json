The researchers found that cancer incidence increases with age, similar to the age-incidence pattern observed in humans. This finding highlights the importance of considering age when studying cancer in animals and humans, and emphasizes the need for precise knowledge of the ages of individuals in cancer research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Oncology"}
