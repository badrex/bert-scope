It develops the concept of ambiguous surfaces, which arise when reconstruction yields multiple different surfaces in space that can give rise to the same image correspondences. The study of these surfaces and their properties can help improve our understanding of instabilities in reconstruction based on image correspondences.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
