The method involves using a steel rod as a ballistic pendulum and measuring the momentum of the rod and the end-piece after impact. Experiments with lead bullets and gun-cotton show that the method can give accurate estimates of the maximum pressure and duration of very violent blows.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical engineering"}
