They discovered that an interrupted current could cause an arrest of the rhythmic beat, similar to the inhibition seen in vertebrate hearts. The authors found no evidence of a localized inhibitory or automatic mechanism in the mollusk heart and concluded that it has no distinct nervous connection with the rest of the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
