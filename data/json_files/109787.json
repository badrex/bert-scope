The author, William Allman, extends the existing method of exterminating quadratic surds to include surds with indices as integral powers of 2, cubic surds, and combinations of surds with factors 2 and 3. The methods can also be applied to equations with up to three surds, whose indices do not exceed 12.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
