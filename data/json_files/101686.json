They found that some items, like strawberries and cherries, could be preserved in a vacuum for an extended period without spoiling, while others, like meat and bread, would spoil faster in a vacuum. This research could have implications for natural philosophy and the potential development of new preservation methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Food Science"}
