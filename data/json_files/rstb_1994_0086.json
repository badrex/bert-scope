The author argues that these numbers are often invalid and misleading, and instead suggests that conservation biologists should recognize the role of biodiversity in management policies and consider novel approaches rather than relying on universal rules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Conservation Biology"}
