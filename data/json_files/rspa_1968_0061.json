They measured the fluorescence of thallium in hydrogen-oxygen flames diluted with different gases and calculated the quenching cross sections for several species. These cross sections were used to re-calculate the rate constants of reactions involving thallium, providing a better understanding of flame kinetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
