It explores the different modes of propagation, including velocity modes and pressure modes, and examines the propagation constants in various limiting cases, such as infinite conductivity, slightly attenuated waves, and weak magneto-hydrodynamic coupling.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
