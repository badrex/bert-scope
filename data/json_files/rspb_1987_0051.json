This finding supports a genetic model that predicts three trichromatic types in female squirrel monkeys, resulting from X-chromosome inactivation. The polymorphism of photopigments in squirrel monkeys may be maintained by the heterozygous advantage enjoyed by trichromatic females, providing a crucial role in segregating different gene-products into different cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
