He explains the process of gas diffusion and the factors affecting it, including the role of molecular movement and the properties of porous materials. Graham also discusses the use of the diffusiometer, a device that measures the rate of gas diffusion through a porous plate, and the resistance offered by capillary tubes to the passage of gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
