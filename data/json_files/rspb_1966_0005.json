They found that all the eliminations of hydrogen at C-4 of mevalonic acid during its conversion into phytoene have the same stereospecificity, with the 4-R hydrogen being retained and the 4$ hydrogen being eliminated. This result also confirmed that the biosynthesis of squalene follows the same stereospecific pattern as in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
