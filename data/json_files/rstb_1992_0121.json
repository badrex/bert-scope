The osphradium is composed of sensory cells with aberrant cilia and pigment formations, as well as free nerve processes. The author discusses the functional and ecological significance of the osphradium and its unique features, which reflect the phylogenetic isolation of this relict snail.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Mollusca"}
