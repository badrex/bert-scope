They examined the gland's macroscopic anatomy, histology, and the methods used for studying its structure. The research aimed to understand the differences and similarities in the gland's structure across species and provide insights into its function within the endocrine system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Histology"}
