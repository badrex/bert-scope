The research shows that the association between the nudibranch and zooxanthellae is a highly integrated symbiosis, with between 25-50% of the total photosynthetic products synthesized over an hour moving from the alga to the animal. The respiratory rate of the association is positively correlated with the density of zooxanthellae, suggesting that they may directly influence the host's respiratory rate by increasing the supply of respiratory substrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
