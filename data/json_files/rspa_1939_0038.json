The cross-sections are bounded by arcs of two orthogonal circles, and the authors use conformal transformation methods to obtain the canonical functions. The study provides new insights into the flexure solution and extends the results to lenticular cross-sections, offering formulae for the torsion moment and moment integrals in the flexure problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
