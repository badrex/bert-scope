F. W. Herschel, explores the algebraic expression of the number of partitions a given number is susceptible to. They discuss properties of differences in powers of natural numbers and the concept of periodic functions. The article demonstrates how to express the product of periodic functions and provides methods for evaluating functions and their sums.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics"}
