They found that the glide direction is along the [111] direction, and the glide plane is near the crystallographic (123) plane. The study provides insights into the deformation and behavior of body-centered cubic crystals, which is essential for understanding their mechanical properties and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
