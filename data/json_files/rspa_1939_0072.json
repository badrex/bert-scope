They found that the energy spread of the fast ions resulting from the electron transfer process can be fully accounted for by the energy spread in the incident ions for certain energy ranges, indicating that the angles involved in the process have definite values. This study helps to understand the behavior of ions and atoms in gas discharges and plasma physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
