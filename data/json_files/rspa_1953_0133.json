They found satisfactory agreement with previous results obtained through numerical integration of the integro-differential equation. The study also showed good agreement with experimental data, indicating that the variational method can provide accurate results over a wide range of electron energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
