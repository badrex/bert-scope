They find that surface strain plays a significant role in the charging of materials, and that the traditional tribo-electric series cannot include all solids. The research also reveals that the arrangement of elements based on their tribo-electric charges corresponds closely to their chemical qualities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
