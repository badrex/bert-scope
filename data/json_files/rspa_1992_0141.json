They compare their theoretical findings with experiments by Nishioka et al. (1979) and find encouraging quantitative agreement. The study highlights the importance of nonlinear disturbances in understanding the transition process and the potential of the nonlinear break-up criterion for predicting breakup transition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
