They develop a method to calculate the wave resistance and provide a formula for the total wave resistance of a specific type of pressure system, called a waveless system. This research helps in understanding the behavior of water waves and pressure systems in motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
