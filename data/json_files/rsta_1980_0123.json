The model is based on the transfer of vacancies from high-angle grain boundaries to intergranular precipitates, satisfying the low stress requirement for cavity growth. This mechanism is relevant for materials with a high fraction of the applied load converted into surface energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
