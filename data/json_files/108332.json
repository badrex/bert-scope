He discovered that the rate of gas discharge is not dependent on the gas's density, and he distinguished between effusion (gas passing through small apertures) and transpiration (gas passing through tubes). Graham's work provided a foundation for understanding gas behavior and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas dynamics"}
