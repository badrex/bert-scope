They observed that speckling is a dominant trait in the moth's color pattern, but occasionally, non-speckled moths can be dominant. The study also revealed that heterozygous individuals may sometimes be indistinguishable from recessive ones. The author believes that this variation can be found in wild specimens in England.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
