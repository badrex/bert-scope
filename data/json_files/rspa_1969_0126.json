They identify four main mechanisms of deformation, including the plastic rigid solid mechanism and radial compression. The study also highlights the importance of the angle of the wedge and the elasticity of the indented material in determining the deformation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
