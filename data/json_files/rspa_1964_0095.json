They provide values for five types of these integrals analytically, and the contributions of four other types through a combination of analytical and numerical integration. The result is used to improve the understanding of fluid properties and test approximations in the theory of fluids at equilibrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
