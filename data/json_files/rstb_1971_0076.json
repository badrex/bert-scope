It highlights the advantages of exocytosis, a process in which vesicles containing neurotransmitters fuse with the cell membrane and release their contents into the extracellular space. The author explores the implications of exocytosis for neurotransmitter substances, the coupling between the stimulus to the cell and secretion, the cellular dynamics of neurons, and the tissue innervated by neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
