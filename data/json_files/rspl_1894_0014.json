They found that copper electrolysis in a vacuum yielded more consistent results than in air, and that adding a small amount of free sulfuric acid to the solution improved the consistency of the deposits. This research provides insights into the practical applications of electrolysis in current measuring instruments and verifies Faraday's Law of Electrolytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
