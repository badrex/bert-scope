He found that using a combination of auxiliary iron rods could produce higher degrees of magnetic energy. The compound process, which involved placing steel wires between two rods of iron, resulted in better outcomes than the simple process. The author also observed that the quality, size, and temper of steel wires affected the success of the experiment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
