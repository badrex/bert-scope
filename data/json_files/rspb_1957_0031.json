They found that the uptake of maternal globulin by the yolk-sac splanchnopleur is selective, resulting in different concentrations of homologous and heterologous proteins in the fetal serum. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of maternal antibody transfer and protein selection during fetal development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
