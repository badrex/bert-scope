The authors argue for the existence of a separate system of tubes, distinct from the blood-vascular system, which spreads throughout the foot and is connected to the reproductive organs. They provide evidence through various experiments and injections, demonstrating the distinctiveness and functionality of this system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mollusk Anatomy"}
