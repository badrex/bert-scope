It reviews the development of oceanic-uptake models and highlights the importance of understanding the factors governing the uptake of carbon dioxide by the oceans, such as the capacity for absorption, air-sea exchange rates, and the rate of mixing of surface water into deeper layers. The article also emphasizes the need for improved understanding of oceanic processes to better assess the potential impacts of climate change.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
