They found that a transient rise in intracellular calcium occurred with each spontaneous action potential, and that calcium entry via L-type calcium channels and the sarcoplasmic reticulum play a significant role in regulating calcium levels in these cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
