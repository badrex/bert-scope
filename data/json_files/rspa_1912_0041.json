The author also analyzes the possible causes of the observed dissymmetry in the scattered radiation and proposes a theoretical explanation based on the acceleration of charged electrons and electromagnetic forces. The findings contribute to the understanding of R\u00f6ntgen radiation and its interactions with matter."}
