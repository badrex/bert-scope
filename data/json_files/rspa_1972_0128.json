They determined the rotational structure and molecular constants for both molecules, as well as the Coriolis coupling coefficients for the degenerate vibrations. The study provides a more detailed understanding of the infrared spectra and molecular properties of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
