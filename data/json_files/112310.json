Sylvester introduces the concept of polar umbrae and their properties, specifically focusing on the theorem relating to polar umbrae and factorials. He demonstrates that the product of a longitudinal and transverse factorial of the same polar umbral matrix is identically zero. This theorem is used to obtain the resultant of a linear system of equations in its most perfect form.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra"}
