They also find a weekly tidal wave that affects atmospheric and magnetic currents, moisture deposition, and other meteorological phenomena. This research contributes to the understanding of meteorological science and the study of atmospheric tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
