They discovered that extracts from the \"medullary\" portion of the suprarenal glands caused a significant increase in blood pressure in both toads and mammals, while extracts from the \"cortical\" portion had little to no effect. This research provided evidence that the active principle in the suprarenal glands has a direct action on the blood vessels and is not connected to the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physiology > Blood Pressure Regulation"}
