They used a method of alternate exposure to radiant and electrically generated heat to approach the ideal of pure substitution. This new instrument allowed for more reliable measurements and provided independent evidence of the accuracy of the N.P.L. scale.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
