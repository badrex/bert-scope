They measured reaction rates, activation energies, and frequency factors, and found that the rate of hydrocracking over nickel and possibly tungsten and rhodium is desorption-controlled, except for reactions within a quaternary group. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of hydrocracking and the role of different catalysts in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
