They found that the fungus grows best in a specific temperature range and requires vitreous humor to thrive. The authors also discovered a bacterium, Bacterium decalvans, associated with hair destruction in alopecia areata, a type of hair loss. This bacterium can be treated to arrest the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
