The authors develop a formalism to describe the propagation of electromagnetic waves in a magnetized plasma embedded in a strong background gravitational field, with applications in astrophysics, such as black holes, neutron stars, and cosmology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
