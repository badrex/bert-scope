The study focuses on conical flow, which is nearly similar to the flow over the forward half of a slender wing even at low speeds. The results show that the vortex sheet model accurately predicts the height of the vortex above the wing and the normal force on the wing, while the pressure distribution on the lower surface and the inboard part of the upper surface is also successfully predicted.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
