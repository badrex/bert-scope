The disease caused symptoms such as fever, headache, and swollen glands. The outbreak was traced back to contaminated water used in the dairy, which contained a large quantity of \"albuminoid ammonia.\" The disease spread to 320 individuals, and the dairy's supply was stopped, leading to a decrease in new cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Epidemiology"}
