They identified approximately 100 fossil insect species, many of which are now extinct in Britain. The insect fauna and the recovered climate data suggest a cooler and more continental climate than present-day Britain. The authors propose the name \"Upton Warren Interstadial Complex\" for these deposits, which provide valuable insights into the climate and environment during the last glaciation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
