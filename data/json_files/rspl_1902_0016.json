They discovered that the plant contains prussic acid, which is dangerous to animals. The poison is produced by the action of a hydrolytic enzyme on a cyanogenetic glucoside called dhurrin. The authors also studied the protective purpose of the cyanogenetic glucoside in the young plant and plan to investigate other plants with similar properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biochemistry"}
