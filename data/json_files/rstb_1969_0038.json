The attachment organ is covered with cuticular villi and has sensory structures called scolopidia, which are suitable for chemoreception. The presence of these receptors indicates that a chemosensory mechanism could operate during the gregarious behavior of settling cyprids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
