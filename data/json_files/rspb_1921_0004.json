The author examines the influence of temperature and the period of survival after operation on reflex times, finding that these factors can significantly affect the length of reflex times. The research provides insights into the neural mechanisms of reflexes in frogs and their response to environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
