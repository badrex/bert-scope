The geosyncline developed along the western margin of the Archaean Sve Province and culminated with the emplacement of a pair of batholiths. The evolution of the geosyncline is compared to Phanerozoic geosynclines, suggesting that early Proterozoic tectonics are similar to those of the Phanerozoic era.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Precambrian Geology"}
