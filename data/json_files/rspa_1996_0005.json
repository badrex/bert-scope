They introduce a discrete ordered calculus that supports the calculus and noncommutative algebra needed for their work, leading to a non-commutative electromagnetic formalism. The paper aims to provide a platform for further exploration of the relationship between this formalism and standard electromagnetism, as well as the implications of special relativity in a non-commutative context.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
