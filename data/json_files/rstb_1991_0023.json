It examines the development and regeneration of the nervous system in adult leeches, demonstrating how axons accurately regenerate connections with their appropriate targets. The study also investigates the role of competition during embryogenesis in guiding the formation of selective connections within the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
