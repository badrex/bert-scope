The study explores the relationship between wave velocity, water depth, and gravity, and applies the findings to the case of bores, where water transitions from one uniform level to another. The author concludes that a suitable law of gravity can compensate for pressure changes in long waves and bores, allowing for their existence and providing insight into their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
