The authors analyze fluid-solid diagenetic and metamorphic reactions in convergent plate margins and explore internal and external fluid sources, including porosity reduction, diagenetic and metamorphic dehydration, and the breakdown of hydrous minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
