Pickard developed a method for resolving racemic secondary alcohols into their optically pure isomerides, which was of practical convenience and widely used. He also made notable contributions to education administration, serving as Principal of Battersea Polytechnic and playing a key role in the development of the University of London's external degree programs."}
