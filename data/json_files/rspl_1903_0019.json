The author conducted experiments at different temperatures and found that the rate of evaporation and the saturation of air play a significant role in the process. The results provide insights into understanding the evaporation process and its implications in meteorology and climate science.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Meteorology"}
