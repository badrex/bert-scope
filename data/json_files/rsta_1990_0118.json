They present theoretical developments and computational methods, including the use of generalized internal coordinates, two-step variational procedures, and the discrete variable representation. Illustrative calculations are shown for LiCN and a Van der Waals molecule. This research aims to understand large-amplitude motion and highly excited states of chemically bound systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
