They found that smooth muscles have both viscous and elastic properties, which allow them to return to their original state after being stretched or released. This research helps us understand how smooth muscles work and how they differ from striated muscles like those in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Smooth Muscle Physiology"}
