They used color photometry to measure the intensity of sunlight and found that the color composition of sunlight varies depending on the location and atmospheric conditions. The author also compared their observations with those made at high altitudes and found that the atmospheric conditions at lower altitudes affect the transmission of sunlight.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
