They find that GPDH has a high proportion of amino acid parallelism and reversal (homoplasy) at four sites, which is significantly greater than other proteins. This indicates that GPDH is strongly constrained by both the number of amino acid differences and the types of changes allowed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
