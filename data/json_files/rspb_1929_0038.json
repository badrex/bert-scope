The research focuses on the formation of rings of chromosomes during meiosis and the factors affecting chromosome pairing and segregation. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of chromosome behavior and the role of chromosome linkage in Oenothera species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
