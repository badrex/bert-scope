They introduce a characteristic tensor and derive the wave equations using a Lagrangian function. The new equations satisfy the conditions laid down by Dirac's investigation and lead to the Schrodinger-Gordon wave equation when there is no electromagnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
