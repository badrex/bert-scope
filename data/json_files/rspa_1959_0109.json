Two classes of these compounds are identified, with different blocking activities based on the size of the quaternary groups. The authors propose a mechanism of action for these compounds, involving the interaction with acetylcholine receptors in the synaptic membrane. The study provides insights into the development of more effective ganglion-blocking agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Pharmacology"}
