They found a maximum frequency and proposed that these bursts are caused by mesotron showers. The results support the idea that mesotrons produce showers that spread out and give rise to electron showers in the surrounding material. This study contributes to the understanding of cosmic-ray bursts and the role of mesotrons in particle physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
