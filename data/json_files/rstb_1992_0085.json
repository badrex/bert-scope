The researchers found that the nucleus is responsible for controlling the intraocular lens muscle, which helps in adjusting the lens for better focus. They also discovered that the nucleus is connected to the ciliary ganglion and the nucleus of the posterior commissure, forming a central pathway for visual accommodation in teleosts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology"}
