They found that the sun's atmosphere mainly consists of hydrogen and is extremely tenuous. The authors also concluded that the sun's photosphere is gaseous and not a solid or liquid surface. Their findings challenge the existing theory of the sun's physical constitution proposed by Kirchhoff.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
