They discovered three types of copper layers (type I, II, and III) with distinct properties and behaviors. Type I raises the work function and can be desorbed thermally, type II lowers the work function and diffuses over the surface, and type III has a stable structure up to 3 atom layers. The findings provide insights into the behavior of copper layers on clean tungsten and contrast with other work on epitaxial overgrowth of metals with different lattice dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Science"}
