The author supports the idea that it is partially or entirely insect-pollinated and that its seed maturation occurs more rapidly than in other Gymnosperms. The study also discusses the development of male and female flowers and the prothallial tubes' nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
