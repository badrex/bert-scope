They discovered that luminescence originates from the umbrella margin and is controlled by local mechanical or electrical stimulation. The photogenic tissue, which appears as yellow-green fluorescent masses, produces intracellular luminescence, and there is no evidence for transmission of excitation around the margin of the medusa. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of bioluminescence in these marine animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
