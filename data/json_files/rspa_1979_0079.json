They correct misleading arguments published by Ford and identify the sources of error in his calculations. The study focuses on the radiative level shifts (Lamb shifts) of a hydrogen atom between the plates and provides a comparison with the shift for an isolated atom. The results show that the radiative shifts are influenced by the distance between the plates and the atom's position.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
