The researchers found a latency of a few milliseconds that decreased logarithmically with increased depolarization. The minimal latency with strong depolarization was about 2 ms, which is long enough to support a chemically mediated coupling mechanism between depolarization and calcium release from the sarcoplasmic reticulum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
