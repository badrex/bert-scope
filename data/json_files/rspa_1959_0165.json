They discovered that the transformation occurs gradually over a temperature range, and hybrid single crystals with co-existing domains of different structures form during the process. The results provide insights into the understanding of continuous thermodynamic transformations in solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
