It explains the two functionally distinct mechanisms by which secretagogues can increase enzyme secretion: mobilization of cellular calcium and activation of adenylate cyclase. The article also highlights the phenomenon of potentiation and desensitization of enzyme secretion caused by secretagogues."}
