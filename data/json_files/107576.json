Fulminating platinum appears as a brown powder and can explode with a loud report when heated. It has potential applications in various fields, such as explosives and metallurgy. The explosive force is exerted in all directions, but mainly downwards, and the temperature at which it explodes is about 4000 Fahrenheit.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
