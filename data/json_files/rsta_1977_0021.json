The study includes relativistic equations of motion for the nine planets and the Moon, perturbations from Earth's zonal harmonics, lunar tesseral harmonics, and tidal bulges. The fitting program incorporates corrections for atmospheric delays, nutations, solid body Earth tides, and relativistic clock transformations. The results provide improved observatory coordinates, mass ratio, and lunar gravity field harmonics.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
