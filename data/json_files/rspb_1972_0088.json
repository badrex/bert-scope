The eye's anatomy and function are investigated through various methods, including electron microscopy and light microscopy. The research demonstrates that the skipper butterfly's eye functions according to Exner's superposition principle, providing a clear understanding of its optical system and vision capabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Entomology"}
