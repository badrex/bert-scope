They used the model of Longuet-Higgins, Opik, Price, and Sack to interpret the distortion quantitatively. The study provides definitive evidence that the three bands correspond to degenerate electronic states of SO^+. Four ionization potentials were found, and the first three electronic states of SO^ have an unexpected order, with the ground state being degenerate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
