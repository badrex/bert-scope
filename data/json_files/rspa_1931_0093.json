They discovered a micellar structure and found that swelling increases the capillary size, making the fiber more accessible to reagents. This research provides a better understanding of the internal structure of wool fibers and can help predict dye fastness and processing in the textile industry.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Materials Science"}
