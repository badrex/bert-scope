These mites are difficult to see due to their small size and color, but can be observed under a microscope. They cause itching by biting and moving under the skin, and can be transmitted from person to person. The mites' life cycle involves laying eggs in the skin, which can lead to the recurrence of the itch after treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
