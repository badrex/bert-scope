They propose that galactic X-ray sources have compressed magnetic fields that rapidly relax, transferring energy to ultra-relativistic electrons. This process leads to the production of X-rays, which can be observed and studied to better understand the behavior of these celestial objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
