The author argues that during sexual reproduction, ciliates undergo embryonic-like development, creating an ontogenetically new soma. This embryological perspective sheds light on various historical issues in development and evolution, such as protozoan immortality, sexual reproduction, and inheritance of acquired characters. The findings challenge traditional notions and provide new insights into ciliate biology and evolutionary predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
