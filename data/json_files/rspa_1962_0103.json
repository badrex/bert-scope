They use a perturbation approach to analyze the diffraction of waves by the cylinder and provide a high-frequency asymptotic evaluation for plane wave incidence. The study explores the simultaneous influence of surface curvature and variability of surface properties on the high-frequency field diffracted by an object.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromagnetic Theory"}
