The technique involves using a bitumen-rubber latex mixture as a damping material, which adheres readily to concrete surfaces and provides effective damping for vibrations. The effectiveness of this technique is demonstrated through the damping of the foundations for a railway in the City of London.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
