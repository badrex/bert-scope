They found that gas adsorption can alter the evaporation rate of the metal and its specific resistance, which can impact the growth and properties of the films. This research has implications for various applications, including molecular beams, surface catalysts, thermionic, and photoelectric surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface chemistry"}
