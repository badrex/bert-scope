They use a test involving cherry laurel leaves and cyanophoric glucosides to study the impact of different substances, such as chloroform, ammonia, and various salts, on cellular membranes and enzymatic activity. Their findings suggest that substances that can penetrate cellular membranes and enter the circulation can influence cellular processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
