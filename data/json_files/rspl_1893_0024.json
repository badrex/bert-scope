They also compared the arc spectra of thallium, indium, and gallium, finding that their characteristic lines advance towards the more refrangible parts of the spectrum in the inverse order of their atomic weights. This research contributes to the understanding of the spectral reactions and properties of these elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
