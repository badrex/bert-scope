He explores the irregularities in the duration of eclipses of Jupiter's satellites due to the figure of its body, which is not truly spherical but a prolate spheroid. Witchell's study helps in understanding the inclination of planes and the angle between right lines in a spherical triangle, which is essential for celestial mechanics and astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
