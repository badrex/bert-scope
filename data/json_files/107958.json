By reducing the problem to three differential equations, the author demonstrates a more efficient approach to understanding the effects of planetary perturbations on orbital elements. This method can be applied to any number of disturbing bodies and offers a valuable contribution to the study of celestial mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
