The author finds that the decay of zinc's photoelectric activity can be expressed by a single exponential term after an initial rapid change. The study provides insight into the behavior of metals under the influence of light and the underlying mechanisms of photoelectricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
