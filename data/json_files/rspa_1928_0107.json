They demonstrate that water-hammer is a significant factor in the erosion of propeller blades, pump runners, casings, and turbine blades, and explain how this phenomenon can be used to account for the erosion of steam turbine blades due to drops of water impinging on their surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
