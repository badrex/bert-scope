By simulating an infinite and bi-periodic surface, they can analyze scattering from two-dimensional surfaces, even at near-grazing angles. This research helps improve the understanding of scattering problems and has applications in coastal and shipborne radar backscatter from rough ocean surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
