The authors calculate the cross-section for positron annihilation and compare it with the two quantum process, photoelectric effect for hard X-rays. They also explore the implications of positron annihilation in primary cosmic radiation and its potential role in producing secondary gamma rays of high energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
