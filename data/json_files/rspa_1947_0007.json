They applied this theory to recoilless guns, smooth-bore mortars, and worn orthodox guns. The study helped in understanding the loss of performance in worn guns and provided methods for testing and designing these weapons.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
