They also investigate the reaction of barium peroxide with bibasic anhydrides, which have powerful oxidizing properties. The organic peroxides represent a new group of chemical substances with unique reactions, expanding our understanding of organic compounds and their analogies to inorganic substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
