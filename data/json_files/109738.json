He estimated the dimensions of these parts and suggested that the tail's formation is due to the expansion and decomposition of luminous matter under the sun's influence. He also speculated that comets might be derived from nebulae and could visit other suns in their orbits.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comets"}
