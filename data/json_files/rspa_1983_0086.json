The authors use transform methods to find exact forms for the stress components required to vanish at the free surfaces, and discuss the unique challenges posed by non-convex wedges. The findings have implications for understanding wave behavior in elastic materials and the development of more accurate models for wave diffraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
