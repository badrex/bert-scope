By analyzing the g-value variations, they determined the orientations of the haem planes and provided insights into the crystal structures. This research helped to understand the properties of haemoglobin and myoglobin, which are essential for studying protein structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
