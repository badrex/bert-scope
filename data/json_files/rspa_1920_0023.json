They used a simple setup with a wedge-shaped silver bromide sample and a spectroscope to compare the light intensities before and after passing through the sample. This method allowed them to determine the extinction coefficient of silver bromide, which is important for understanding its photochemical properties and improving photographic film technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
