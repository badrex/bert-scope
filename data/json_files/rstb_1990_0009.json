The author investigates the effects of methylation on viral promoters, such as those from adenovirus type 2 and type 12, and discusses the potential for methylation to influence other biological processes. The study of DNA methylation patterns and their effects on gene expression is crucial for understanding complex diseases and genetic disorders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Genetics"}
