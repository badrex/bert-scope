They find that this phenomenon is not caused by surface tension or capillary forces, but rather by the difference in the rates of diffusion of solutes in the solutions and the direction of gravity. The authors explain two cases of this phenomenon and provide possible explanations for the observed behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
