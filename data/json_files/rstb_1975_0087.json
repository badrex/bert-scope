The New Hebrides islands are part of the ridge systems parallel to the east coast of Australia, resulting from crustal plate interactions. The article outlines three main volcanic episodes and the associated carbonate sedimentation, which have influenced the islands' geomorphology and the chemical nature of the exposed rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Island Arc Systems"}
