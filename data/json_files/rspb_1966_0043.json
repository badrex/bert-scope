They found that thyrocalcitonin lowers blood calcium and phosphate levels and remains effective under various conditions, such as parathyroidectomy, nephrectomy, and vitamin deficiencies. The hormone acts on bones and likely plays a significant role in normal physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
