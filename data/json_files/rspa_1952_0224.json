They found that a lead monoxide coating significantly reduced the maximum rate of pressure rise, indicating that the inhibition was due to the suppression of 'degenerate branching' in the oxidation process. The authors concluded that lead monoxide efficiently destroys certain radicals, which may help clarify the inhibiting effect of lead tetraethyl on combustion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
