The pig's guts were distended and transparent, with no visible signs of sex. The rectum was closed, and the ureters were inserted into the rectum. The stomach was full of a hard substance resembling curds. The student could not find a bladder or uterus and could not identify a valve in the digestive system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Embryology"}
