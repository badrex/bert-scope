He used base measurements and various angles to calculate the Earth's density. Hutton's methods involved measuring the base RB in Glenmore and the base ~ in Rannoch, and then calculating the lengths of other lines in the survey using the measured bases and observed angles. This research provided a more accurate method for calculating the Earth's density and understanding the importance of precise measurements in surveying.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
