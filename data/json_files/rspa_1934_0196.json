They found that the mobility of ions in nitrogen can be used to determine their mass, and discovered evidence of electron capture in molecular nitrogen ions. The study also provided insights into the breakdown of Langevin's law, which relates mobility to pressure and field strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ion Physics"}
