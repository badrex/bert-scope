Corner, discusses the results of the Royal Society expedition to the British Solomon Islands Protectorate in 1965, focusing on the mountain flora of Popomanaseu, Guadalcanal. The article lists seed-plants collected above 1300 meters and notes the absence of grasses and small herbs, disproving the hypothesis of random origin of this mountain flora. The findings contribute to the understanding of plant ecology and biogeography in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology", "sub_discipline": "Plant Ecology"}
