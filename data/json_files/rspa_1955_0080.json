The study includes a detailed analysis of unsteady Helmholtz flows and their applications to aerodynamic problems, such as the flutter of a stalled aerofoil. The theory is extended to incompressible flow and can be further expanded to deal with low-frequency oscillations in subsonic compressible flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
