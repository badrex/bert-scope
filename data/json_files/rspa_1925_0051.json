The author calculates the variation of mutual inductance due to a radial displacement of the secondary coil and compares it with previous results. The findings can be applied to the design of the Campbell Standard of Mutual Inductance at the National Physical Laboratory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
