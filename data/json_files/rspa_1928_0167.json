The author presents two methods for calculating partial pressures and discusses the relationship between osmotic pressure and protein concentration. The study provides insights into the behavior of proteins in biological systems and has implications for understanding protein function and interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
