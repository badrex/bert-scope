They discovered a linear relationship between the remaining shortening in both muscles when the stimulation was compounded. This relationship, called \"constancy of sum,\" suggests that the lengths of the antagonistic muscles remain adjusted for each other during reflex activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
