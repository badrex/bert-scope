The author suggests that not all cations are propagators, and there may be more than one kind of non-propagating cation and more than one kind of propagator. This new understanding of the mechanisms of ionic reactions in organic media can help improve the understanding of polymerization processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
