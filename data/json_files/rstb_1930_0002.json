The research covers various aspects of ascidian development, including hatching mechanisms, perivitelline structures, and the role of outer follicle cells in egg floatation. The findings contribute to a better understanding of tunicate development and marine biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
