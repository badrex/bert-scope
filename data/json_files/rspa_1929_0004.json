The author explores the charges generated on the particles and the surrounding air, and how these charges can be influenced by factors like temperature, speed, and surface materials. The findings provide insights into the complex interactions between particles and surfaces, and the potential applications in various fields, including engineering and environmental studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrical phenomena"}
