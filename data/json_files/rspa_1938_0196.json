The authors use two methods to measure the recombination coefficient and discuss the role of diffusion in their experiments. They find that the recombination coefficient is inversely proportional to gas pressure and that the whole ester molecule contributes to the time constant, suggesting a rigid structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
