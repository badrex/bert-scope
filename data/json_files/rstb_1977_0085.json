These phenomena help researchers understand the role of wave-particle interactions in the magnetosphere and the structure and behavior of the plasmapause. Observations made at Antarctic stations and their northern geomagnetic conjugates show similarities in dominant pulsation periods, demonstrating the uniqueness of the Weddell Sea area in relation to magnetospheric wave amplification at higher frequencies. The goniometer technique, pioneered at Halley Bay, is used to study the direction of these electromagnetic signals, providing valuable information about the structure and dynamics of the magnetosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetospheric Physics"}
