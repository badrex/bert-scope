They find that the lines in the iron flame spectrum are generally weakened in sun-spot spectra, and that the majority of these weakened lines are also relatively strong in the oxy-hydrogen flame spectrum. The author also notes that the lines in the more refrangible part of the spectrum are mainly unaffected in passing from the solar spectrum to that of Arcturus.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Stellar Spectroscopy"}
