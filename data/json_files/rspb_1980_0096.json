The results show that Moniliformis grew well and reproduced normally when rats were fed on diets containing fructose or mannose. In contrast, the worms did not grow or reproduce when fed on diets containing glucose or galactose. The study highlights the importance of suitable dietary sugars for the growth and reproduction of the parasite.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
