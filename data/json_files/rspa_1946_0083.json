They introduce auxiliary quantities and define further auxiliary symbols to study the algebra in detail. The authors find three irreducible representations of orders 1, 4, and 5 for the algebra, which could be important in understanding the behavior of particles like the proton.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
