The authors describe experiments on enriched uranium cylinders and cones subjected to large neutron pulses in the U.K.A.E.A. pulsed reactor Viper, and find good agreement between theoretical and experimental displacements.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
