They highlight the presence of Hildenbrandia lecanellierii and Caloplaca sublobulata in these regions and emphasize the importance of studying these organisms for understanding phytogeography and zonation of life on marine shores. They also touch upon the influence of glacial periods on the distribution of antarctic-type shelf fauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
