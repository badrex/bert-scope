They discovered that the bright bands in the spectrum were not single lines but groups of lines on a faint background. This finding sheds light on the change of a star into a nebula and has implications for understanding the behavior of celestial objects like Nova Aurigae.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
