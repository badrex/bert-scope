They determined the hydrostatic pressure derivatives of 19 second-order elastic constants and 19 of the 20 third-order elastic constants. The results provide insight into the nature of binding forces between atoms in the crystal and help understand the vibrational anharmonicity of the long-wavelength acoustic modes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
