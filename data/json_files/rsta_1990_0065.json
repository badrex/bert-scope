The authors develop a theoretical framework using topological concepts and positive-operator theory in Frechet spaces. They apply this method to three exemplary problems, including one-dimensional model equations, wave motions in density-stratified fluids, and solitary water waves in a uniform canal. The results provide existence and properties of solitary-wave solutions in these physical contexts.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Nonlinear Analysis"}
