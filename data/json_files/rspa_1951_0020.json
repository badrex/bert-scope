They found that transitional metal atoms can accept electrons from the structure, leading to the formation of ternary compounds with characteristics similar to electron compounds. The study supports the hypothesis that transitional metals accept electrons in aluminum-rich alloys, and provides insights into the alloying behavior of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloying and Intermetallic Compounds"}
