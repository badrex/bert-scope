They consider the gas motion as one-dimensional and unsteady, and the solid material as having constant thermal properties. The study aims to explain the observed effects of temperature, pressure, and gas velocity after the shockwave reflection, and to provide a better understanding of the underlying physics of the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
