The researchers used thin sublimed plates to study the absorption coefficients, refractive indices, and birefringence of the material. They discovered sharp absorption bands in the visible spectrum and found that the band structure of cadmium selenide is similar to that of cadmium sulfide. The study provides valuable information for understanding the properties of semi-conducting materials and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Semiconductors"}
