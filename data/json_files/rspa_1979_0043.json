The authors introduce a definition of dynamical stability using measure and probability theory, proving that almost all proper invariant tori are metastable when the regular region in phase space is bounded and has a positive volume. This study has implications for understanding the behavior of conservative systems and the existence of invariant tori in Hamiltonian dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Measure Theory and Dynamical Systems"}
