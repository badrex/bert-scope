They discovered that when regions of the cuticle and epidermis are extirpated and joined together, intercalation occurs along the segmental wavelength, which can result in the formation of an adventitious segment boundary. This demonstrates that segment boundaries are subject to the same rules as other elements in the pattern of the integument.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
