They find that thallium has a unique crystal structure and high solubility, which presents challenges in studying its optical properties. The refractive indices of thallium sulphate are determined for the first time, revealing an extraordinarily high refractive power.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thallium chemistry"}
