The researchers discovered that honeybees can perceive and distinguish between different scents, even in very low concentrations. The bees' own body scent may help them identify comrades and enemies during foraging. Amputating the antennae of honeybees significantly impairs their scent perception. The findings contribute to understanding the complex communication and navigation systems of honeybees.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
