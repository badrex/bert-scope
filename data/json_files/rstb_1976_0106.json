The virus requires the presence of a specific protein aggregate called the disk, which interacts with the RNA to initiate the assembly. The disk aggregate acts as a 'jig' and provides a surface for the formation of the nucleoprotein helix. The study shows that the presence of disks increases the rate of assembly and that they can act as a protein source for the elongation of the virus structure. The disk's role in the assembly process is crucial for understanding the formation of regular viruses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
