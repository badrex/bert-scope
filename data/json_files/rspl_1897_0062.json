The author compares the results of various experiments and finds that the uncertainties in the capacity for heat of water have been greatly diminished. The findings support the use of Rowland's corrected values and contribute to a better understanding of heat and its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
