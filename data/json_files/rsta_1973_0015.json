The authors compare these Proterozoic mobile belts to modern counterparts, analyzing the tectonic displacements and thermal activity within the belts. The Nagssugtoqidian mobile belt is characterized by considerable crustal shortening, limited igneous activity, and high-pressure regional metamorphism, while the Ketilidian mobile belt has limited crustal shortening but significant vertical and transcurrent movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
