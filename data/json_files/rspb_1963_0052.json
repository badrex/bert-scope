{"article_id": "rspb_1963_0052", "revised_title": "Reevaluating Sensory Discrimination Theories", "semantic_tags": ["Sensory Discrimination", "Psychophysics", "Sensory Thresholds", "Detection Theory", "Neural Quanta"], "tldr": "The authors analyze two opposing theories of sensory discrimination: continuous sensitivity and neural quanta. They present theoretical objections to the quantal theory and demonstrate that 'quantal effects' can be artificially produced even in a system with noise. Their findings challenge the existence of genuine sensory quantum and have implications for evolutionary theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Psychophysics"}
