They found that isi inactivation is calcium-entry dependent and has a slower recovery from inactivation compared to other systems. The study suggests that there are two components of total isi: a fast inward current and a slower inward current component caused by sodium-calcium exchange. These findings provide insights into the complex processes controlling the slow inward current in the SA node and its role in generating rhythmic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiac Electrophysiology"}
