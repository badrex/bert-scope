The author discusses the role of haemodynamic conditions in and around vascular leaks and the chemical agents responsible for making platelets reactive. The article also examines the relationship between atherosclerosis, plaque fissures, and the formation of arterial thrombi.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
