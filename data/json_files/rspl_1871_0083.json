This heat, combined with the access of water, leads to volcanic eruptions. The author also discusses the relationship between volcanic phenomena, seismic phenomena, and mountain elevation, and how these are all due to the play of one set of cosmical forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
