The study examines the stratigraphy, petrography, and geological processes affecting the area, such as cryoturbation, solution structures, and decalcification. The fossiliferous Gould's Grove Member, found within the sequence, provides insights into the mid-Pleistocene age of the deposit.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Stratigraphy"}
