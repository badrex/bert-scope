They introduce an interaction principle that allows them to set up exact difference equations for reflection and transmission operators and radiation fields. The theory provides a framework for developing numerical techniques and algorithms for solving radiative transfer problems in more complex geometries and polychromatic scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mathematical Physics"}
