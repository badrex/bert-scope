They discover two distinct types of orientation relations between ferrite and cementite in pearlite nodules, which they attribute to different nucleation processes. The research provides a better understanding of the pearlite transformation and its implications for the formation of pearlite nodules.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
