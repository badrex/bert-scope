The research focuses on the English Lake District and examines the correlations between ion supply and various weather factors, including precipitation, wind direction, wind velocity, and temperature. The findings show that daily weather conditions play a significant role in the supply of ions to fresh waters, with important implications for the environment and ecology.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
