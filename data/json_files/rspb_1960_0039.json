They found that ammonia is readily incorporated into glutamine, glutamic acid, and aspartic acid, but only to a small extent into GABA, glycine, and alanine. This study highlights the importance of ammonia as an active metabolite in brain tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
