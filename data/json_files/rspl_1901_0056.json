They analyze the stress distribution and strains in the cylinders and find that the strength of a cylinder under these stress systems is less than the strength of a cylinder under uniform compression. The study helps in understanding the behavior of materials like stone and cement under different loading conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
