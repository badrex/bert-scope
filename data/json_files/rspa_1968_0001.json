They discovered that the initiation process is essentially the scission of a ligand as a free-radical, with a change in the oxidation number of the metal. The authors also found that manganic 1,1,1-trifluoroacetylacetonate has unique properties, selectively initiating polymerization of certain monomers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
