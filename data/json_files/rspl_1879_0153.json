They discovered that maintaining a constant stress on the wire for a certain period of time, called the \"hardening effect,\" increases the breaking strength and decreases the elongation of the wire. They also found that the rate at which stress is applied affects the wire's breaking strength and elongation, with slower rates leading to higher breaking strength and lower elongation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
