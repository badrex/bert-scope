It describes the characteristics of currents in deep ocean and continental margins, focusing on their energetics, periodicities, and vertical and horizontal length scales. The article also covers the development of mooring systems and current meters for measuring currents in deep waters and the challenges faced in doing so.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
