It examines the inconsistencies in neuroimaging studies and addresses potential confounds, such as chronicity, medication effects, and differences in patient populations. The authors argue that prefrontal cognitive deficits in schizophrenia are likely due to prefrontal pathophysiology rather than artifacts of performance differences between patients and controls.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Neuroscience"}
