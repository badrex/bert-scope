The researchers found that the collision efficiency for ethyl radicals in the gas phase is approximately 0.5, which is in agreement with available data. This discovery helps to better understand the interactions of alkyl radicals and their role in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
