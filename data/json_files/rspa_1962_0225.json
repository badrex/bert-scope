The authors explore the connection between inertial forces and the distant parts of the universe, as well as the role of initial boundary conditions on the metric tensor in explaining the coincidence of inertial frames. They also introduce the steady-state theory, which aims to dispense with the need for special initial conditions in cosmology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
