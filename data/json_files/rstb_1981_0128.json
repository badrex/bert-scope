It highlights the importance of understanding resistance at the individual insect and population levels, as well as the need for multidisciplinary research to develop effective resistance-countering strategies. The author also emphasizes the role of biochemical techniques in monitoring and detecting resistance mechanisms in single insects, and the potential of mathematical models for simulating control strategies."}
