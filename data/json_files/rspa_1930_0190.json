The authors conducted experiments to measure the velocity of water flow in a controlled channel and found that the velocity increases with depth below the free surface, becoming almost uniform over a wide range before decreasing near the bottom. The results reveal asymmetrical flow, with two areas of maximum velocity on either side of the central plane, and a marked slowing down of streams near the bottom at the central plane.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
