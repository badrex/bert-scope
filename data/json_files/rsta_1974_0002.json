The model takes into account the interaction between meteorological-induced surges and astronomical tides, which is essential for understanding and predicting coastal flooding. The study focuses on a severe storm surge in 1962 and demonstrates the model's potential for simulating sea level disturbances in shallow waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
