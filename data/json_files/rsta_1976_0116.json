It explores the importance of equivalent carbon content, maximum weld hardness, and weld cracking susceptibility in high-strength steel plates. The article also covers the requirements for toughness, including the use of the -value parameter and the correlation between small-scale tests and large-scale brittle crack propagation tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
