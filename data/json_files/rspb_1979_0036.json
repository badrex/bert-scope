The researchers found four types of binocular depth-sensitive neurons that may contribute to depth perception. These neurons help process information for both fine and coarse stereopsis, providing a better understanding of how the brain perceives depth and three-dimensional space.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
