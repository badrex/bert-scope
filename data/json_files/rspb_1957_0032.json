They find that papillae form in large, aging colonies and are not necessarily a result of drug-resistant mutants. The study suggests that environmental factors, such as nutrient depletion and toxic substances, play a significant role in papilla formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
