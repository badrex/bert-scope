He demonstrated this by conducting experiments with ice, water, and other fusible substances using a voltaic battery and a galvanometer. This finding has important implications for understanding the behavior of electricity and electrochemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
