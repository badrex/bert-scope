They observed a transition from a low-temperature mode of oxidation to a high-temperature mode, which they attributed to the role of peroxides in generating branching chains. The authors used a modified theory to explain the complex relationships between the rate of oxidation and the concentrations of reactants, and they tested the validity of the theory by comparing it to experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
