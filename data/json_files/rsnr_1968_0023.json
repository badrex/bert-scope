Wren's hypothesis involved a thin elliptical ring called a \"corona\" surrounding Saturn, which he believed could explain the different appearances of the planet observed up to 1658. Wren's work on Saturn's phases contributed to the development of early observational astronomy and telescope design.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
