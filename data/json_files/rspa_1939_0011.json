They discovered a band spectrum with well-defined heads and analyzed its vibrational structure. The results showed that the bands were likely due to the presence of isotopes in the bromine molecule and provided evidence that oxygen was not responsible for the observed spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
