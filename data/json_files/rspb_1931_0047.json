They discovered that several bacterial strains, A, B, C, D, E, and F, isolated from different sources, were capable of oxidizing ammonium salts to nitrite. These bacteria grew freely on nutrient agar media containing organic nutrients, unlike the nitrosomonas group. The authors also found that these organisms produced more nitrite in the presence of sugar, and some could utilize nitrite for their metabolism. However, none of the eight organisms could oxidize nitrite into nitrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
