They found that lesions in the mid-brain involving the isthmo-optic nucleus result in fiber degeneration that can be traced through the isthmo-optic tract to the chiasma and into the contralateral optic nerve and retina. The projection to the retina is completely crossed, and the number of centrifugal fibers is approximately 10,000, forming 1% of the total number of fibers in the optic nerve. The isthmo-optic nucleus receives afferents from the tectum, and there appears to be a well-defined organization in this projection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
