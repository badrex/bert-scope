Using a combined Golgi-immunocytochemistry technique, the researchers identified 23 types of amacrine cells and analyzed their neurotransmitter content, specifically GABA and glycine. The results show that GABA-containing amacrine cells are more numerous and morphologically diverse than glycine-containing cells, indicating that both neurotransmitters play different functional roles in the inner retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
