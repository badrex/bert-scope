They used a method that involved analyzing samples of co-existing liquids and vapors in equilibrium to derive the P, V, T, x relationships for the system. The results showed that the critical pressures of binary mixtures of ethane and propylene were relatively low, and the vapor-pressure curves for the pure components and border curves for nine mixtures exhibited regions of retrograde condensation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
