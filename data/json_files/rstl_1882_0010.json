They find that a circular vortex ring is stable for all displacements of its axis and that the time of vibration for a displacement depends on the size of the vortex. The author also explores the action between two vortex rings that never approach closer than a large multiple of their diameter, finding that the velocities of the fluid due to the interaction can be calculated using certain formulas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
