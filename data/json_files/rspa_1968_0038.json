The author expands the field equations in negative powers of a suitable radial coordinate, similar to Newtonian methods, and finds that the number of arbitrary constants in the solution is twice the number in the static Newtonian field. The additional moments are related to the angular momentum terms that do not act as a source of the field in Newtonian theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Theory"}
