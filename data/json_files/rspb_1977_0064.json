Researchers found nociceptive neurons in the dorsal horn and ventrobasal thalamus of rats, which responded to noxious stimulation of the tail but not to light mechanical or innocuous thermal stimuli. The findings support the existence of a specific nociceptive pathway ascending to the ventrobasal thalamus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
