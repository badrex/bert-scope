They found that X-irradiation of the nucleolus reduces the amount of nucleic acid synthesized in the nucleus, while X-irradiation of the nuclear sap does not have the same effect. This research helps to understand the importance of the nucleolus in cellular synthetic activities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
