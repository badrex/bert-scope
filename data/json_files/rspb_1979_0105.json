It found that the interval distributions of neurons in isolated cortex resembled those in the intact cortex of an alarmed animal. When an animal falls asleep, there is no significant alteration in the modal interval or geometric standard deviation of interval distributions recorded from cells in isolated cortex. This suggests that the reduction of modal interval in intact cortex during sleep is probably due to neural influences from infracortical structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
