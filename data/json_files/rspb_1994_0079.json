The research finds that ungulates can be divided along a slow-fast continuum, with browsers having larger litters and smaller neonates than grazers. The study also reveals a strong pattern of covariation between reproductive traits, such as litter size, gestation length, neonate mass, and growth rate, after accounting for the effects of maternal body mass and common ancestry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
