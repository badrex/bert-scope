They discovered that the colliculi have a sensory-motor area with definite localizations for various movements and postures of the body, similar to the precentral convolution in the cerebral hemispheres of mammals. The colliculi also have deeper structures responsible for movements of the beak and larynx, and a center for voice production and crowing. The study shows that pigeons have a real motor cortex in the colliculi, but not in the cerebral hemispheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
