They use a combination of symbols to represent different weather elements, such as heat, cold, dryness, and moisture, and create a diagram to track these elements over time. The author finds that certain months, like September and November, show striking differences in temperature and precipitation patterns, which may have an impact on future weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
