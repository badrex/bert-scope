The study identifies the sarcoplasmic reticulum as the primary source of calcium in both smooth and striated muscle, and suggests that IP3 plays a significant role in pharmacomechanical coupling in smooth muscle cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
