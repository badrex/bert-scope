He later became famous for his work in ice engineering, studying ice formation and developing innovative methods for removing ice jams in rivers. His research on the St. Lawrence River led to suggestions for engineering projects to improve navigation and manage ice in the river.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ice Engineering"}
