He discovered that the air passing through a thinner body of water caused the leaden pipe to become much hotter, and that the cause of deception was due to a faulty design in the bellows. Fitz-Gerald also found that deeper the horizontal pipe was placed in the water, the less resistance was made by the steam. The experiments led to the discovery of ways to save coal and throw up more water during firefighting.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
