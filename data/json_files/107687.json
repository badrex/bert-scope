This study provides insights into the physiology and pathology of the spine, and the author draws parallels between the bird spine and the human spine, explaining the differences in motion and structure between the cervical, dorsal, and lumbar regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
