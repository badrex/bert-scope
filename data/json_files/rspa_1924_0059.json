They found new intense lines in the spectral region close to the green auroral line, but none of these lines matched the exact wavelength of the famous green auroral line. Their experiments did not support the idea that the auroral green line originates from solid nitrogen, and they concluded that the green line has a terrestrial or cosmic origin different from most other auroral lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
