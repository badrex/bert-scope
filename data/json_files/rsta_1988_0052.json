The study finds that the region is primarily flushed from the north and east, and the missing time histories of the new set of unknowns mean that tritium and helium-3 distributions are only comparatively weak constraints on the flow field, but do set upper bounds on the vertical exchange with surface waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
