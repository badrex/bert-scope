They found that both metals lose weight when exposed to temperatures of 1300\u00b0C for two hours, with platinum losing more weight than palladium. This discovery challenges the widely accepted belief that metals of the platinum group do not sublimate at temperatures below their melting point.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
