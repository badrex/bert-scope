They found that the rate of helium escape from these minerals was much higher than the rate of helium production through radioactive decay. This discovery helps explain why fossilized bones and other materials do not always contain as much helium as expected based on their radioactivity and geological age.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
