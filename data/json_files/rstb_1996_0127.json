They developed a common organizational schema for these areas, allowing for a resolution of previous discrepancies. Additionally, a connectional analysis revealed that each of the newly designated areas is characterized by a unique pattern of cortical relationships, providing a framework for interrelating findings from human brain imaging studies with those from behavioral investigations of non-human primates.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Cognitive Functions"}
