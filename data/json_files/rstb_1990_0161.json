The hippocampus is involved in forming memory traces and long-term potentiation, while the cerebellum and its associated brain-stem circuitry are essential for learning and memory of conditioned responses. The author presents evidence supporting the idea that mossy fibers convey conditioned stimulus information, and climbing fibers convey the critical reinforcement information to the cerebellum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
