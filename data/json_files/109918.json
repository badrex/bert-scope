He obtained three sections of the arc, which allowed him to calculate the length of a degree due to latitude and compare different measures. The survey used five base lines measured with chains and provided a table of the lengths of different degrees from the equator to the pole.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
