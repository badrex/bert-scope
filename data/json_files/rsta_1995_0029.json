The authors highlight the importance of terrestrial gas emissions in controlling the distribution of hydroxyl radicals, which play a central role in cleansing the atmosphere of trace gases emitted by terrestrial processes and human activities.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
