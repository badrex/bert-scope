He finds that the expansion of water is not proportional to the degrees of heat and that specific gravities of solids change with temperature. The author suggests using a simple analogy to correct for these temperature variations and obtain accurate weights and specific gravities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
