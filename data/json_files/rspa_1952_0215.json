They demonstrate that Kelvin's theorems can be applied to the generalized momentum vector, and that Dirac's variables represent the parameters that characterize vortex ribbons in space-time. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of circulation and vorticity in the context of electric fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
