The authors explore the Moon's mean density, the change in velocities at different depths, and the implications of the Moon's triaxial nature. They also examine the Moon's libration, free and forced oscillations, and the effects of solar perturbations on its motion. The authors conclude that the Moon's irregularities and ellipticities are supported by the strength of its interior rather than isostasy or convection.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Lunar Geophysics"}
