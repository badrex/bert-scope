Although the Bedouin were somewhat thinner, their heights, weights, and serum chemistry were similar to the controls. The study found that the Bedouin had a greater forearm blood flow at rest and a smaller response of sweat glands to pilocarpine. However, their production of sweat in response to a rise in deep body temperature, working capacity, and the concentrating power of their kidneys were the same as the controls. Physiologically, the Bedouin did not appear to be better adapted to life in the desert than other human ethnic groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
