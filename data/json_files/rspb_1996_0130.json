Antisense oligodeoxynucleotides targeting the Y1 receptor caused a decrease in body temperature and suppressed feeding behavior, while control oligodeoxynucleotides had no effect. These findings provide evidence that the Y1 receptor subtype plays a crucial role in the neuronal mechanisms regulating feeding and body temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
