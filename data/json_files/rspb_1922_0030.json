They discovered that the primary wall has a spiral structure with possible reversals, and the secondary wall has distinct growth rings. The authors also found that the cotton hair cell-wall is an elaborate structure with unique features, such as slow spirals and radial boundary surfaces, which may be related to the plant's growth and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
