It explains the difference between Zeeman order, induced by an external magnetic field, and dipolar magnetic order caused by interactions between nuclear spins. The author also describes the \"brute-force method\" and the \"King Solomon method\" for enhancing nuclear spin polarization and achieving long-range magnetic order."}
