The authors describe the difference between the diurnal variation of geomagnetic activity in June and December, and explain the observed field changes in winter as being due to a disturbing line current in the ionosphere. The study has implications for understanding geomagnetic phenomena and their relationship with other disciplines, such as ionospheric work and auroral results.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
