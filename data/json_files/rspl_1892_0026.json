The authors used platino-type paper to record observations and found that the total intensity of light remained consistent across various altitudes, countries, and times of the year. The results align with previous spectrum measurements and reveal that the value of k in the formula for calculating light intensity varies with barometric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
