The research provides insights into the evolutionary and ecological aspects of this family, which are considered the most primitive surviving members of the Pulmonata. The findings contribute to a broader understanding of structure and function in the pulmonates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
