They found that the \"per cent. proof load\" was not a reliable indicator of a material's suitability for use in aeroplane wing spars. Instead, they proposed using properties in compression as criteria for evaluating materials, as they are in the case of straight struts.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
