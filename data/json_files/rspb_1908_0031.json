They discovered that emulsin contains multiple enzymes, including gluco-lactase, \u03b2-glucase, and amygdalase. The study also highlights the importance of enzymes as diagnostic agents and the challenges in separating and purifying enzyme products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
