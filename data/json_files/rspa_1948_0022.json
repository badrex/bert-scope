They calculated the frequencies and amplitudes of the vibrations using a simplified model and compared the results with experimental data. The study provides insights into the intensities of vibration bands and the dipole moment of the C-H bond in benzene derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
