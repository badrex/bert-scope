The authors found that the fine structure in thallium spark lines caused the observed Zeeman patterns to deviate from the predicted types. The study provides experimental information on the behavior of atomic nuclei and electronic features of atomic structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
