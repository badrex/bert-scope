The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, conducted experiments on various trees and found that both the bark and alburnum are capable of generating new bark or transmitting a fluid that contributes to its formation. He also discovered that the cellular substance in the bark and alburnum allows sap to pass through, suggesting a similarity to the anastomosing vessels in the animal economy. Knight concludes that it is difficult to determine whether the matter that composes the new bark is derived from the bark, the alburnum, or both.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
