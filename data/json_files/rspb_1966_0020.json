Template processes involve the use of a pre-existing template to determine the uniqueness of a product, while stepwise processes rely on the specificity of an enzyme to determine the specificity of a product. The author explores the different types of template processes, including those involving chromosomal DNA, RNA, and protein synthesis, and suggests that there may be more types of template processes operating in heredity and related fields. The author also touches upon the challenges of understanding non-chromosomal inheritance and template systems based on macromolecules other than nucleic acids."}
