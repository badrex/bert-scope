They found that the distribution depends on the width and shape of the potential hole between neutron and proton interactions. The results showed that the distribution was not isotropic, with a maximum at smaller angles than expected. The study provides valuable information about the nature of neutron-proton interactions and helps improve nuclear theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
