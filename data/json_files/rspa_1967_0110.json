They found that only the results obtained by Hattori, Kuriyama, Katagawa, and Kato were capable of detailed analysis, and that the covalent bond in silicon can be described by two non-spherical components, similar to the bond in diamond. The study also showed that accurate electron density studies become more difficult with increasing atomic number, making it less profitable to examine heavier atoms until current data precision standards are improved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
