They discovered that the eye plays a crucial role in the background response, and that there is a direct or \"primary\" response of melanophores independent of the background response. The study also suggests that a two-hormone hypothesis may explain the complex coordination of color changes in crustaceans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
