He discovered that these membranes are composed of numerous small vessels that transport nutrients. The author also found that fat particles are formed within these vessels and that they are not separated from the blood. This research provided insights into muscle and fat formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
