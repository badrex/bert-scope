He worked on both single-crystal and powder methods, solving complex structures like \u03b1-manganese and y-brass. His research on pseudo-symmetry and lattice parameters helped advance the understanding of metallic states and crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
