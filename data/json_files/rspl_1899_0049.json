The results show that large doses of thyroid preparations cause eye changes, hair loss, and paralysis in monkeys. The study suggests that thyroid extract may act similarly to the stimulation of the cervical sympathetic and that the increased secretion of the altered thyroid in Graves' disease may be partly responsible for exophthalmos in that condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
