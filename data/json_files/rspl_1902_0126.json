They found clear differentiation in the shape of grey matter and cell groups in various segments of the cord, which correlated with the parts supplied with motor nerves. The study also revealed some unrecorded features in the porpoise spinal cord's minute structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
