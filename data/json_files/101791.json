Ceruss is produced by rolling lead plates, placing them in pots with vinegar, and burying them in a dung bed. The process involves various accidents and health issues, such as stomach pain, fever, asthma, and blindness, which are mainly caused by the mineral fumes from lead and the dust of the ceruss flakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
