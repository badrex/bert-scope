He observed a building moving and heard a sound similar to a cannon explosion. The shaking lasted only a few seconds, and the author was surprised by the event, as he had not experienced an earthquake before. He could not recall the exact degree of the building's inclination, but estimated it to be several degrees from the perpendicular.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
