The study describes the various aspects of the blood circulation system, including the different blood vessels and their contractions. The author also discusses the oxygen supply to the muscles and the possible role of coelomic capillaries in supplying oxygen to genital products during the breeding season. The research was conducted at the Station maritime de Biologie, Tamaris-sur-Mer, and at the University of Birmingham.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
