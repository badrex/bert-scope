Herschel presents a general and uniform analysis of the aberration of spherical surfaces in lenses and object-glasses. He provides practical results for correcting spherical aberration in refracting telescopes, which can be easily computed and applied to various materials. The author also highlights the importance of moderate curvatures, the variation in curvatures of exterior surfaces, and the negligible difference between interior surfaces in achieving a perfect telescope.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
