The researchers used a modified Knudsen effusion method to measure the vapour pressures and found that the melting points of the alkali metals are significantly affected by the presence of impurities. The results contribute to a better understanding of the physical properties of these elements and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
