The author explores the use of ultrasonics to measure velocity, attenuation, absorption, and scattering to gain information about the microstructure of materials. The techniques can be used to determine correlations between microstructural parameters and material properties, such as strength, hardness, and toughness, which are essential for designing and constructing components and systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Non-Destructive Testing"}
