They found that active chlorine has a life period of at least 75 seconds and can react with substances like acetic acid, benzene, and toluene. The authors also investigated the effects of different discharge conditions and the role of water vapor in the production of active chlorine. Their findings contribute to the understanding of chlorine chemistry and its applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and reaction kinetics"}
