These compounds enable dynamic structural analysis of enzyme-catalyzed reactions and protein-ligand interactions by rapidly and efficiently releasing biologically active molecules within crystals. The author presents practical considerations and examples relevant to studies of Ha-ras p21 and glycogen phosphorylase.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
