They find that the number of nucleoli per cell is independent of the size of the nucleus and that larger nucleoli are associated with higher numbers of nucleoli. The study provides insights into the behavior of nucleoli and their role in plant cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
