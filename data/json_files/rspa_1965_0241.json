It explains how observations of infrared emission can be used to deduce composition and temperature in the stratosphere and the importance of thermal radiation in the atmospheric energy budget. The article also briefly reviews observations of the infrared airglow emission from OH and its significance in the energy radiated from the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
