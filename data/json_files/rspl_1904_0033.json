The results confirm the use of Callendar's difference formula for reducing platinum thermometer readings to the normal scale. The study extends the comparison to a temperature of 1000\u00b0C and includes a table for calculating the value of T directly from the value of Pt.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
