They found that higher members of the 5-alkyl derivatives of 1:2-benzanthracene showed a progressive decrease in carcinogenic potency. The results also confirmed earlier findings that substitution in position 2 and, to a lesser degree, position 1 promotes carcinogenic action. The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between chemical structure and carcinogenic properties for cancer research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Carcinogenesis"}
