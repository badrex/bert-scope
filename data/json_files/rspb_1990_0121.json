The results show that neem oil can block fertility in female rats for variable periods, up to 180 days, without affecting ovarian functions. The mechanism behind this contraceptive effect appears to involve the activation of local immune cells, leading to a cellular immune response that blocks implantation. This novel method of contraception has the potential to be reversible and could offer a new approach to family planning.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
