The authors explore the use of these techniques in understanding the stereochemistry and conformation of molecules, focusing on carboxyl and aromatic compounds. They also introduce a sector rule for interpreting the results of circular dichroism in lactones and discuss the effects of additional rings on the magnitudes of Cotton effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
