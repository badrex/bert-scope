They found that the concentration of serum protein, particularly albumin, increased in mature rats compared to suckling rats. The amount of y-globulin declined rapidly between 18 to 24 days of age, which coincided with the gut's absorptive capacity. The authors also observed a significant change in the serum protein pattern between 18 to 40 days, with y-globulin and / ^-globulin showing the most pronounced changes. These findings suggest that the decline in y-globulin is related to the absorption of maternal antibodies and the rat's ability to produce y-globulin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
