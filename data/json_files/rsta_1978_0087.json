The authors found a sequence of varied lithologies with major and minor disconformities in both reef and non-reef accumulations. They also discovered that the present viable outer reefs are remnants of more extensive precursors and that the area's geological history is marked by significant paleoenvironmental changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
