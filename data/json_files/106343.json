They discuss the differences in their results, focusing on the expansion of quicksilver and air, and provide a new rule for reducing observations that requires no logarithms and can be engraved on a thermometer scale. This rule is useful for computing barometer observations on the spot, making it more convenient for fieldwork.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
