He found that these insects were highly predatory and could rapidly consume large numbers of fish. This observation highlights the potential threat these insects pose to fish populations and the need for further study on their impact on aquatic ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
