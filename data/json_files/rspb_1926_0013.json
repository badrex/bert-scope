They discuss the limitations of the method and its potential for studying changes in red blood cell sizes during experiments. The instrument is useful for observing differences in red blood cell sizes, but the method is not reliable for determining absolute sizes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
