They investigated the solubility and reactions of silver ions with various halides and other anions, determining solubility products and heats of solution. The study demonstrates the applicability of the electrometric method to precipitation reactions and complex formation in molten media, providing insights into the solvation process in ionic melts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
