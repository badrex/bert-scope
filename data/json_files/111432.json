Plover at Point Barrow, on the shores of the Polar Sea, from 1852 to 1854. The observations were conducted using an ice observatory and involved recording the magnetic declination and auroral phenomena. The author, Edward Sabine, found that the disturbances in magnetic declination followed systematic laws and that there was a striking correspondence between the disturbance laws at Point Barrow and Toronto. The article also highlights the high frequency of auroral manifestations at Point Barrow and their correlation with the westerly disturbance-deflections.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
