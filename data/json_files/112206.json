They provide a detailed explanation of terms related to ice properties and the forces acting on glaciers, emphasizing the differences between solid, plastic, and viscous bodies. The author argues for a clear distinction between solidity and plasticity, and suggests that ice is a solid, brittle mass that cannot be considered plastic or viscous."}
