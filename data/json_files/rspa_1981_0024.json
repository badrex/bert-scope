The author derives a criterion for stabilization to explain the Taylor dependence of the critical Reynolds number on the ratio of the radii. The friction law is given a phenomenological description using the velocity distribution in the turbulent zone, observed by Taylor. The results have relevance to astrophysical problems, such as turbulence generation in accretion disks near compact stars which are X-ray sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
