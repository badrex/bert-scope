The author investigates the role of enamel cells, known as ameloblasts, and their processes in the formation of enamel, as well as the relationship between enamel and dentine. The study provides insights into the development of enamels in different mammals and sheds light on the unique characteristics of marsupial enamel.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
