They propose that this phenomenon is due to non-linearities in the contractile elements of the flagella, which limit the amplitude of tail oscillation and allow for the suppression of natural oscillation by external waves. This research provides insights into the mechanics of flagella and the processes causing their movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
