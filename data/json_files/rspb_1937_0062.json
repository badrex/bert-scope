The researchers found that the uterine oestrone threshold varies among the animals and that oil solutions of the hormone given intramuscularly do not affect its absorption and effectiveness. The study also suggests that a shorter latent interval precedes uterine bleeding after longer courses of oestrone injections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
