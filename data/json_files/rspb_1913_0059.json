They describe the symptoms and progression of the infection, as well as the location of the parasites within the host's body. The author also discusses the potential similarities between T. gondii and Leishmania, another parasitic species. Through a series of experiments, they study the infection's impact on different organs and tissues, providing insights into the host-pathogen interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
