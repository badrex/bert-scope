They find that the electrostatic contribution to the system's chemistry is negligible when the contour charge spacing is much larger than the length, but becomes significant when the wavelength and linear charge spacing are comparable to the Debye length. The study provides insights into the behavior of polyelectrolyte systems and their potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
