He also investigated the temperature of the freezing point of mercury. The results showed a slightly different coefficient of increase of elasticity of air compared to Regnault's findings. Additionally, Stewart discovered that the temperature of the freezing point of mercury remains constant, with a difference in readings between an air-thermometer and a standard mercurial thermometer due to an anomalous contraction of mercury before freezing.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
