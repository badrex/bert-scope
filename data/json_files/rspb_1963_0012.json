One system contains weakly fluorescent chlorophyll a, while the other contains fluorescent chlorophyll a and a large amount of phycoerythrin. These systems interact, leading to cytochrome oxidation, pyridine nucleotide reduction, and fluorescence. The findings provide a better understanding of the complex processes involved in photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
