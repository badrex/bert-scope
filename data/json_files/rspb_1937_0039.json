The administration of the extract causes changes in the stomach, including engorgement, hemorrhage, and erosion of the mucosa. The researchers also observe that the presence of acid-secreting oxyntic cells is essential for the production of these gastric lesions. The findings suggest that the pituitary gland plays a significant role in regulating alimentary blood flow and secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Gastroenterology"}
