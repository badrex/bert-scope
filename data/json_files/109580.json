They discovered that these orifices do not lead to the nostril or ear but to a distinct bag. These bags are lined with a cuticle, which forms the transparent cornea, and are found in venomous snakes. The purpose of the fluid secreted in these bags remains unknown.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Herpetology"}
