He discusses the applicability of Kirchhoff's lines and the discrepancies between Angstrom's and Ditschei's measures. The author provides a general table of corrections and tables of the lengths of light-waves for the air and metals, as corrected by the quantities deduced from the table.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
