The research provides new skull restorations for the genera Loxomma, Megalocephalus, and Baphetes, and offers insights into the evolution and functional morphology of these ancient creatures. The authors suggest that the antorbital vacuity, a characteristic feature of Loxommatoidea, evolved for a piscivorous habit and a kinetic inertial system of jaw closure. The study also sheds light on the mechanics of jaw closure and the function of the basipterygoid articulation in the primitive temnospondyl skull.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Evolutionary Biology"}
