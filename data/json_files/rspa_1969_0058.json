The authors use the impact parameter method and a multi-state approximation to study the interactions and cross-sections of these collisions. They find that at low velocities, the charge transfer cross-section is dominated by curve-crossings, while at high velocities, the cross-sections are influenced by the electronic splitting of the molecular ion. The predicted cross-section curves are consistent with available experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
