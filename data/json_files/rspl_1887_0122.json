They discovered that certain changes in the cells cause increased impenetrability, and they suggest that this is due to a contraction of the protoplasm. The author believes that this contractility is responsible for the movements in irritable plant organs and that it is similar to the contractility found in animal cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
