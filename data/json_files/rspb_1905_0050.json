The author concludes that moist air, heat, light, and oxygen are necessary external factors, while internal factors such as irritability and assimilation play a role. The nuclear phenomena in intumescences and wound-callus are found to be similar to those in pathological tissues of plants and animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
