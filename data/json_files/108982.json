The author presents experiments conducted on dogs to understand the influence of respiratory movements on arterial pressure and heart contractions. The results show that during inspiration, the heart's action is accelerated, and during expiration, the pressure is diminished while the heart's action is slowed down.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
