They found that the larvae have typical naupliar characters, with three pairs of limbs and a large upper lip containing labral glands. The larvae's diet consists of protozoal and bacterial microorganisms, which they consume to grow to the adult stage. The author also described their method for embedding and sectioning the larvae for further study.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
