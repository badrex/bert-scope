Through a series of experiments with different microscope constructions, he demonstrates that one can see distinctly with much smaller optic pencils. He concludes that the indistinctness of vision may be caused by factors other than the size of the optic pencil, such as the aperture of the object-glass and the focal length of the lenses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
