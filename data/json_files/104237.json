They mixed equal quantities of nitre and flour of sulphur in a small container and heated it. Upon opening it the next day, they found long, bright, brittle hairs around the edges of the container, which turned out to be pure nitre. This experiment provided insights into the nature of mineral earths and the abundance of nitrous particles in the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
