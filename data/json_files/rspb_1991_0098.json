The results show that these currents are dihydropyridine-sensitive and play a role in the generation of action potentials in pituitary cells. This research provides evidence for the importance of calcium channels in the electrical activity of these cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
