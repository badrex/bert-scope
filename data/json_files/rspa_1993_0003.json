They apply this method to obtain convergent expansions for modified Bessel functions of large order, improving upon existing asymptotic expansions. The study uses a combination of Gevrey-type estimates, integral equation methods, and Laplace transforms to analyze the equations and their solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
