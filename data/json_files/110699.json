He discovered that blood corpuscles can transform into cells that form the chorion and muscular fibers. This research supports the theories of Schwann and provides evidence of the diverse roles blood corpuscles play in tissue development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
