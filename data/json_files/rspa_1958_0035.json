The method uses orthogonal functions to represent the flow and provides a simpler solution than previous methods. The results show that instability first sets in when a parameter reaches a value of about 36, in agreement with earlier findings. The study also reveals a marked asymmetry in the cellular pattern of motion that occurs at the onset of instability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
