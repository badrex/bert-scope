They performed benzene pressure extractions and alkaline permanganate oxidations to analyze the differences between these constituents. The results showed that while there were some differences in the chemical structures, the \"dull\" constituents generally yielded more benzene carboxylic acids and less oxalic acid compared to the \"bright\" constituents. The \"fusain\" was more resistant to oxidation and had a different carbon distribution in its oxidation products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
