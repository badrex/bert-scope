He provides a brief description of the instruments used, such as the transit instrument and altitude and azimuth circle, and explains the methods employed for obtaining accurate right ascensions and declinations of stars. This catalog and the methods described were intended to be useful when more extensive means of accomplishing the work with greater accuracy might be available.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
