The authors evaluate non-Markovian terms for a homogeneous plasma using a technique developed by Prigogine and Balescu. They estimate the time span over which these terms are significant and find that for certain conditions, they can be ignored. The study contributes to obtaining methods for solving problems involving weak long-range forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
