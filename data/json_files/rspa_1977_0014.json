The researchers found that the dimensionless threshold stress for grains resting on the top of a flat bed in a turbulent stream is significantly lower than previously reported values. The experiments suggest that protrusion of individual bed grains is an important factor in determining their stability and should be considered in future studies of sediment transport and stream bed dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
