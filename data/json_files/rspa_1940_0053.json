They discovered that the CH frequencies of a CH2 group are not significantly affected by the nature of the molecule in saturated compounds, but increase by 150 cm^-1 when the CH2 group is attached by a double bond. The study also found that the absorption of CH bands in the 3/4 region is crucial for understanding the molecular structure and chemical bonding of hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
