They found that the shifts for certain isotopes were in agreement with previous findings, while others showed discrepancies that could be explained by insufficient blending of hyperfine structure components. The study provides a better understanding of the atomic structure and properties of barium isotopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
