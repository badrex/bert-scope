The study also discusses the transformation of the Rhipidistian hyomandibular to the primitive tetrapod stapes or columella, and the development of a freely movable neck joint in early tetrapods. The author concludes that Eusthenopteron's hyomandibular is directly comparable to that of Ectosteorhachis and was likely articulated with the endocranium in a similar fashion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
