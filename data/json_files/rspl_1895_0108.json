The authors conducted experiments to determine the temperature coefficients and the extent of corrections needed for temperature changes in practice. They found that cells respond readily to temperature changes and that the accuracy of the standard can be affected by these variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
