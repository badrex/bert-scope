They find that blue-green algae, specifically Anabaena and Phormidium species, play a significant role in nitrogen fixation in waterlogged rice fields. This discovery could have implications for sustainable agriculture and improving soil fertility in rice cultivation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Soil Microbiology"}
