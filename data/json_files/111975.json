The author presents a series of experiments and observations, detailing how the dimensions and form of the camphor film affect its detachment from the substance, and how the radial lines of water adhesion cause the camphor to rotate. Additionally, the author discusses the influence of mutual attraction, evaporation, and the presence of other volatile substances on the camphor's motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
