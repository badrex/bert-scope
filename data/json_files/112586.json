The author uses a new method to create a tidal chart, which helps to simplify the complex nature of these currents and improve navigation for sailors. The study also highlights the differences in tidal times and behaviors along the coast, providing valuable information for future research and navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
