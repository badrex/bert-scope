They discovered that the main band system falls into nine series, which can be expressed by a Deslandres formula. This arrangement into series is similar to other well-known spectra, such as the 1st positive bands of nitrogen and the less refrangible spectrum of cyanogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
