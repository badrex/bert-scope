They analyze the transformation of the symmetric pseudo-scalar meson theory to reveal saturation properties and discuss the use of a self-consistent field in nuclear structure. The authors also consider residual interparticle forces within the nucleus and electromagnetic interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
