D. Ellis and W. J. Henderson, conducted experiments to study the phenomenon of induced radioactivity discovered by Curie and Joliot. They investigated the production of radio-phosphorus from aluminum using alpha particles of different energies and analyzed the excitation probability and potential barrier of the aluminum nucleus. The authors also compared the efficiencies of producing radio-elements from boron, aluminum, and magnesium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
