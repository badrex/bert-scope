It highlights the development of a practical characteristic code for problems with many discontinuities and the incorporation of particle-in-cell features into Eulerian mesh methods. The article also reviews the use of artificial viscosity terms and the advantages and limitations of different methods in one and multiple dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
