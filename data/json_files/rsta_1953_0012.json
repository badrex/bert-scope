The authors explain the initial stage of the discharge, where secondary emission from the end-walls controls the multiplication process, and the later stages where gas properties determine the total growth of the discharge. They employ a new experimental technique to measure the discharge current and compare their results with theoretical predictions, demonstrating good agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
