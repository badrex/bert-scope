Despite the obstruction being in the left ventricle, the patient's right side was affected, and the left side had some remaining function. This observation challenges the author's initial opinion about the relationship between ventricle obstruction and corresponding side effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology"}
