The pump features a tapered bore that allows it to move water more easily and quickly than traditional cylindrical pumps. This design also reduces wear and tear on the pump and its components, making it a useful tool for draining low grounds, pits, mines, fish ponds, and shipping. The pump was tested and recommended by Dr. Francis Glisson and Dr. Jonathan Goddard to the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Pump technology"}
