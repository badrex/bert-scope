The study compared experimental evidence with calculated results, supporting the charge independence of nuclear forces and favoring symmetrical exchange forces. The research also discussed iterative methods for solving numerical integro-differential equations related to these types of collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
