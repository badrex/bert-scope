The author examines the gravid uteri of several lemur species and concludes that their placenta is diffused and non-leciduate. This finding challenges the classification of lemurs and the theory of mammal evolution proposed by Haeckel.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
