They analyze the discrepancies between computed star positions and observed positions, focusing on the right ascensions and declinations of stars. The author concludes that there may be an astronomical cause contributing to these deviations, rather than solely errors in observation or instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
