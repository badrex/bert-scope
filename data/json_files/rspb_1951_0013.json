The researchers discovered that antibodies from immune serum injected into the exocoel of foetal rabbits do not enter the foetal circulation. This finding suggests that the placenta is not the primary route for antibody transfer, and the yolk-sac splanchnopleur may play a more significant role in antibody transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
