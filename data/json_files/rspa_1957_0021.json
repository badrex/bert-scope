They found it to be a normal valency intermetallic compound with a pseudo-body-centered cubic structure. The semi-conducting properties are explained by a filled Brillouin zone containing two electrons per atom. The crystal structure also suggests an acceptable mechanism for its photo-emissivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
