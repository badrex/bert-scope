By using multiple instruments on aircraft and tethered balloons, researchers collected data on mean flow and turbulent fluctuations. The study found that continuous small-scale turbulent mixing was generally confined to an Ekman layer a few hundred meters deep, with direct coupling between the Ekman layer and the overlying atmosphere being weak and dependent on cloud processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
