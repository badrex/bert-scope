It introduces the source-function technique of Schwinger and develops an algebra of functional expressions to evaluate matrix elements as indefinitely repeated integrals. The author also discusses the connection between the functional integral approach and the Feynman principle, showing that both lead to similar results.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
