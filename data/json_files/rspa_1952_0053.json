The researchers found that the reaction occurs between adsorbed oxygen gas and adsorbed carbon monoxide. They also discovered that the reactivity of the adsorbed oxygen decreases with time, and they proposed a reaction mechanism involving carbon monoxide, oxygen ions, and a complex on the surface."}
