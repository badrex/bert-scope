They found that the mobility and diffusion coefficient of ions are affected by the presence of water vapor, and they provided a detailed method for measuring these effects. This research contributes to the understanding of ion diffusion in atmospheric science and has implications for the accuracy of measurements in related fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
