They find that the surface charge varies between different strains of yeast and is influenced by the pH level. The negative charge may be attributed to combined phosphate, while the positive charge is tentatively attributed to protein. This study provides insights into the composition and structure of yeast cell walls, which can help in understanding their properties and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
