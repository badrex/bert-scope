The authors examine structure and bonding in deep mantle and core materials using experimental and theoretical results, focusing on examples such as oxides, silica, perovskites, and metals. The findings highlight the growing understanding of the Earth's deep interior and the importance of iron in mantle phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
