They apply this method to various cases commonly used in quantum-mechanical and quantum-chemical calculations, providing a set of independent equations to replace the original equations. This approach allows for a better understanding of the error in approximations and can be used to improve the accuracy of quantum mechanical models.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
