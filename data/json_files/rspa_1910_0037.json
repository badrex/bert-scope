The authors found that the boiling points of all the metals studied, when expressed on the absolute scale, conform fairly closely to Ramsay and Young's law, being similarly affected by pressure. The results indicate that the readily carburizable metals would show a closely similar dependency on the pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
