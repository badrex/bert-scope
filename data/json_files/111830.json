He discovers three distinct bodies formed when rubian is exposed to oxygen and alkaline substances. These bodies are Rubianic Acid, Rubidehydran, and Rubihydran. Schunck also examines the properties and compositions of these substances, as well as their reactions with other chemicals. The findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical structure and behavior of rubian and its derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
