They calculate the parity-violating weak neutral current perturbation of electronic energy for various amino acids and peptides, finding that the ground-state energy of L-enantiomers is lower than their D-enantiomers due to the electroweak interaction. This energy difference is significant for the transition from racemic geochemistry to homochiral biochemistry in terrestrial evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chiral chemistry"}
