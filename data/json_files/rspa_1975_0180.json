The authors develop a method to compute the profiles of interfaces, which helps in understanding various capillary systems and their configurations. They also discuss the drop-weight method of interfacial tension measurement and its limitations. The study has implications for fundamental measurements, mineral flotation, fluid flow and drainage, and adsorbent-adsorbate interactions in porous media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
