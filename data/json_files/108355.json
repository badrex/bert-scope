Frederic Daniell and W. A. Miller conducted research on the electrolysis of secondary compounds, focusing on the behavior of complex electrolytes under the influence of the voltaic current. They discovered that different elements travel together as compound anions and cations, or as iso-electric bodies, which are groups equivalent to each other and to simple ions in their relations to electric forces. This research provided insights into the constitution of aqueo-acids, hydro-acids, and ammonium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
