They found that the metals' magnetic properties differ in the solid state, with some having a positive susceptibility and others negative. The results suggest that the magnetic properties of elements in the periodic system may vary based on their crystal structure and atomic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
