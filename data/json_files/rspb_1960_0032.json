They found that rats in smaller litters grew faster and became larger adults than those in larger litters. This accelerated growth affected various aspects of development, including anatomical, physiological, and chemical changes. The study provides insights into the relationship between growth rate and development in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
