They apply this method to cobalt and nickel ferrites and find good agreement with the spin-wave theory of dispersion. This new approach allows for a better understanding of the spin-wave contribution to the specific heat in spinel ferrites.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
