They also determined that the necessary current density decreases with time, which affects the electrode's potential. This study provides a better understanding of the oxygen electrode's behavior and its impact on the hydrogen-oxygen cell's efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
