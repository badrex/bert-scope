Desaguliers that uses quicksilver (mercury) to raise water without friction. The engine avoids the problems of traditional hydraulic engines, such as loss of water and increased friction, and can raise a hogshead of water to a height of 27 feet in less than two minutes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical engineering"}
