This procedure is based on a new variational principle that determines the effective potential function of a given nonlinear polycrystal in terms of the corresponding potential for a linear comparison polycrystal. The authors apply this procedure to compute bounds for the effective potentials of statistically isotropic nonlinear polycrystals, specifically untextured FCC polycrystals with isotropic pure power-law viscous behavior. These new bounds are more restrictive than the classical Taylor-Bishop-Hill bounds and related Hashin-Shtrikman bounds by Dendievel et al. (1991).", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanics of Materials"}
