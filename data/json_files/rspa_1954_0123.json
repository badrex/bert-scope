They found that two main reactions occur: breakdown of the main chain and decomposition of the side chain with gas evolution. The degradation process was followed by measuring changes in molecular weight and viscosity. The authors also investigated the effects of temperature, radiation type, and the presence of additives on the degradation process. The findings provide insights into the behavior of PMMA under radiation exposure and potential applications for measuring radiation doses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
