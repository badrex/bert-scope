They found that the distribution of calcium in grass pollen tubes differs from that in Lilium longiflorum, with a less pronounced or absent basipetal concentration gradient in the subapical zone. This difference is due to the unique organization and growth mechanism of grass pollen tubes, which rely on pre-existing polysaccharide particles (P-particles) for wall growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
