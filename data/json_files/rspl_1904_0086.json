They suggest that the greatest effects should be recorded when the solar polar regions are most directed towards the Earth at the equinoxes, and the effects should be at a minimum when they are least directed at the solstices. This theory is supported by the observation that the frequency of magnetic storms and aurorae is closely related to the prominence disturbances in the polar regions of the sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
