He explains that music in ancient times had a greater influence on people's emotions and behaviors due to its simplicity and the inclusion of poetry and dancing. Wallis also notes that the design of music has evolved over time, with modern music primarily focusing on pleasing the ear rather than eliciting specific emotions or behaviors.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Musicology"}
