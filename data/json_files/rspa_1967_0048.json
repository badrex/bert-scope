The author explores the behavior of various chromophores, including 1,3-dienes and carbonyl groups, and analyzes their electronic spectra and circular dichroism. The article also highlights the importance of molecular geometry in determining the coupling between chromophores and the resulting optical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
