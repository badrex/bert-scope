It explores the symbiotic relationship between legumes, such as white clover, and grasses, and how this relationship impacts the amount of nitrogen fixed in the soil. The authors also examine the effects of fertilizer use on nitrogen fixation and suggest ways to encourage the retention of clover in grasslands.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
