They investigated the kinetics of the semiquinone radical, semiquinone radical ion, and triplet state in various solvents and hydrogen-ion concentrations. The study provides a detailed understanding of the reaction mechanisms and rate constants involved in these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
