They discover that the highly reflecting layer is unaffected by various treatments, but can be removed using dilute hydrofluoric acid. The author also examines the conditions for producing a highly reflecting layer and its properties, such as its resistance to various treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
