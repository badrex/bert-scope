The researchers found a small shift in the foveal luminosity curve towards shorter wavelengths at lower brightness levels, accompanied by a hump on the red side of the curve. For extrafoveal areas, the usual Purkinje shift was observed, requiring surprisingly high intensities before the photopic curve was approached. The study suggests that rods may continue to function over a wider range of intensities than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Color Perception"}
