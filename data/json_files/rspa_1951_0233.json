The integral is reduced to a single integral using analytical methods, and a function is tabulated that can be useful in other applications, such as dynamical astronomy. The theory is illustrated with an example of radioactive radiation absorption in rods.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Integral Evaluation"}
