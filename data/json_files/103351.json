Villette's Burning Concave: Melting and Vitrification of Various Materials", "semantic_tags": ["Materials Science", "Metallurgy", "Glassmaking", "Heat treatment", "Vitrification"], "tldr": "This article describes a series of experiments conducted with Mons. Villette's burning concave, a large concave mirror made of a mixture of copper, tin, and tin-glass. The experiments aimed to study the melting and vitrification of various materials, such as Roman pottery, chalk, fossils, and metals, when exposed to the intense heat produced by the concave mirror. The results provide insights into the time it takes for different materials to melt and change their properties under extreme heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Glassmaking"}
