The author presents nine definitions or modes of generation for the Pippian curve and discusses its relation to the Quippian curve and the Hessian curve. Some results are due to Mr. Salmon, with whom the author was in correspondence on the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
