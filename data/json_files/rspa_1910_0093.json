They argue that focusing solely on the number of principal colors may overlook other important color sensations. The author also suggests that purple should be considered a principal color, and highlights the challenges in distinguishing between dark orange and brown. This paper contributes to the understanding of genetics and color perception in relation to Mendelian inheritance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
