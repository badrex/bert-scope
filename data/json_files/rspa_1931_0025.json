They discovered a new method for analyzing the complex fine structure in the mercury lines, which involved using a Fabry-Perot interferometer and a low-pressure high-frequency discharge. This method allowed them to observe the fine structure of several lines, including 4916, 4108, and 6234, and provided valuable insights into the behavior of mercury atoms in different states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
