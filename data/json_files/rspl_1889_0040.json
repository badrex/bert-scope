They found that at higher altitudes, people breathe less air to produce the same amount of carbonic acid, which indicates that the body needs more oxygen at higher altitudes. The author also discovered that cold temperatures can increase the amount of carbonic acid expelled in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
