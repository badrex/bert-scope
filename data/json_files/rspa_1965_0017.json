They discovered that water and carbon monoxide are produced during the reaction, suggesting that both combustion products are formed directly in the main chain branching cycle. The study also observed the formation of significant amounts of hydrocarbons early in the main chain branching oxidation reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
