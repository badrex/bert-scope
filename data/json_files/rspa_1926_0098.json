The authors develop a method to obtain the general conditions of equilibrium in systems containing electrolytes, considering electric forces at phase boundaries and the components' electric neutrality. They also discuss the application of the phase rule to systems with electrolytes and the conditions of equilibrium between phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
