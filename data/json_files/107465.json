W. Herschel, introduces a new method for integrating periodic series and circulating functions, which are series with terms that follow a recurring pattern. He demonstrates how to use a theorem involving the roots of equations to integrate these series and solve equations of finite differences. This method can be applied to various types of series and is useful in analyzing complex mathematical problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
