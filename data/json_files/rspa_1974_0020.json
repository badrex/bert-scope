They analyze the Schwarzschild field of a particle and compute the curvature forces in the local rest frame of an observer on a test body. The authors calculate the scattering of a pulse of gravitational radiation by the test particle and the radiative loss of gravitational energy in a rapidly moving particle. They also compute the radiation spectrum and total energy radiated in a distant brehmsstrahlung encounter as an example.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Waves"}
