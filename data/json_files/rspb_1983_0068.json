They found that lesioning the horizontal cells in the right optic lobe significantly changed the fly's response to binocular front-to-back motion, while leaving the response to back-to-front motion and counterclockwise motion unaffected. This study provides strong evidence that horizontal cells control yaw torque generation and turning of the fly to the ipsilateral side.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
