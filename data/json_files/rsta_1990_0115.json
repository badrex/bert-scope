The author applies variational Rice-Ramsperger-Kassel-Marcus (RRKM) theory to several microcanonical unimolecular dissociations and bimolecular associations, comparing the results with experimental data and phase space theory. The study focuses on the transition state and its role in determining reaction rates and product quantum state distributions."}
