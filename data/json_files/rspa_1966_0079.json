The results show that hydroxyl radicals react faster with methane and carbon monoxide than with formaldehyde, and the reaction rates are temperature-dependent. The findings contribute to understanding the oxidation processes of these molecules and the role of hydroxyl radicals in these reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
