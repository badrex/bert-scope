The author, F. Nicholls, examines the debate over whether aneurysms are caused by artery dilation or a rupture of the internal and external artery coats. Nicholls also presents a case study of an aneurysm and suggests that it is formed by blood forcing through the ligamentous coat and distending the membranous outer coat.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Cardiology"}
