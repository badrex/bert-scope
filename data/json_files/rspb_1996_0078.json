It explores how sperm competition affects male and female reproductive rates, and how it influences the time investment of each sex in mate searching and parental care. The study concludes that sperm competition per se does not affect the mean male potential reproductive rate, but can influence the direction of sexual competition through variations in male time investments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
