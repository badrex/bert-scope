The study reveals that the eggs develop into a free-living larva that later transforms into a parasitic phase, attaching itself to a specific fish species. The article emphasizes the importance of considering larval development in the classification of these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mollusca"}
