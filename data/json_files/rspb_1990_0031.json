It suggests that exposure to different ecological situations and the inherent capacity to produce and retain morphological characters may be the primary factors affecting the quality of phylogenies. The study examines the semaphore geckoes (Pristurus) and other lizard clades to understand the impact of environmental factors and the development of new features in phylogeny reconstruction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
