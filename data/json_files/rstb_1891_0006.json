They used Lippmann's electrometer and galvanometer to measure the electrical changes in the spinal cord and mixed nerves when the cortex cerebri was stimulated. This allowed them to investigate the localization of nerve centers and the communication between them, providing insights into the physiology of the spinal cord and its relation to higher centers and peripheral nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
