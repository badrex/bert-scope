They find that the proportion of energy lost per mean wave cycle is independent of the frequency range, and estimate the constant in terms of the drag coefficient of the wind on the sea surface. The results suggest that the drag coefficient may decrease slightly as the wave age or non-dimensional fetch increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
