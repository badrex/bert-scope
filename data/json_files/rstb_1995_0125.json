The author conducts a cladistic analysis of sauropod relationships and compares sauropod phylogeny with recent work on Mesozoic paleogeography. The study aims to understand the impact of Laurasia and Gondwanaland's break-up on sauropod evolution during the Jurassic and Cretaceous periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
