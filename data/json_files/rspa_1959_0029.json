They use relaxation methods and modified spherical polar coordinates to analyze the flow patterns and pressure distribution. The results show a transition from symmetrical Stokes's flow to a boundary layer type flow as the Reynolds number increases. The study also highlights the formation of a wake and the change in flow patterns with varying Reynolds numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
