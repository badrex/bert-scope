They discovered that heat treatment can cause a mosaic formation in the micas, which is partially reversible on cooling. This structural change is closely related to the anomalous decrease in thermal conductivity observed at elevated temperatures. The thermal expansion of the lattice constant and the sharpness of high-order spectra indicate that the atomic arrangement in the individual crystallites remains perfect during the breakdown of the large-scale crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
