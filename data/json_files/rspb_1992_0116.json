The patient's ability to select between semantically related items in a word-picture matching task deteriorated until selection became random. Knowledge of category membership and specific features declined together over the same period. The findings support a theory of access to semantic memory that is non-hierarchical.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology and Neuropsychology"}
