The researchers found that the sampling density of ganglion cells limits motion acuity in peripheral vision, even for high-velocity targets. This provides evidence that the parvocellular pathway is involved in processing information about motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
