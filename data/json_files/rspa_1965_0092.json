The research explores the effects of temperature, material properties, and vessel geometry on the failure stress and critical crack length. The findings suggest that controlling factors such as yield strength, Charpy energy values, and crack-arrest temperature can help avoid catastrophic failure of steel pressure vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
