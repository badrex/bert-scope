The researchers found that stomatal opening and assimilation rates are closely related, with stomatal opening being the main factor affecting assimilation rates. The findings provide insights into how plants regulate their uptake of carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
