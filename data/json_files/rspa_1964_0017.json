They demonstrate that the first Born approximation should vanish when considering uncorrelated electrons and introduce a generalized formalism to address this issue. The study provides insights into the behavior of particles in high-energy scenarios and the limitations of the first Born approximation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
