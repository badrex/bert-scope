By using the concept of adiabatic invariance, the author derives an exact solution to the classical dynamical problem and obtains a good approximation to the rate coefficient. This study is relevant to understanding momentum transfer cross sections, charge transfer, and other reactive collisions in ion-molecule interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
