The author discusses the development of bands with pure solvent and with a solvent containing another solute, and provides simple conditions for complete separation of the two solutes. The study is based on the work of Wilson, de Vault, and Weiss, and assumes Langmuir adsorption isotherms for the two substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Separation Techniques"}
