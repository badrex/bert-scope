The study examines three species of locusts and presents illustrations of selected sections in transverse, horizontal, and sagittal planes to help interpret the arrangement of nerve fibre tracts and areas of neuropil. The guide aims to assist researchers in relating individual neurons to the overall organization of the ganglia, enhancing our understanding of the locust's nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
