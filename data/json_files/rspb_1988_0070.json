The research reveals that each species has a unique sperm morphology, indicating that spermatozoa can be used as a taxonomic character. The findings suggest that the loss of the acrosome in some chitons is correlated with a modification in egg-coat thickness. The study aims to determine whether sperm morphology can provide insights into possible relationships between chiton taxa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology and Invertebrate Biology"}
