They examined the area's physiography, including the Uganda escarpment, and the various tectonic features that form prominent scarps and mountain ranges. The study aimed to provide a general basis for future workers and to understand the formation of the Rift Valley. The authors also discussed previous geological work in the area and the significance of Lake Rudolf's western shore features, such as the Turkwel delta and the Ferguson Gulf sandspit.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
