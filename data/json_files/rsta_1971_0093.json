The authors develop a Langevin equation for vortex rings and a Fokker-Planck equation, applying the theory to various problems, including nucleation in an unbounded fluid, nucleation in a finite channel, and vortex formation by ions. The study provides insights into the complex nature of critical velocities in liquid helium and the dynamics of superfluidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
