The author, David Gooding, examines the significance of experimental demonstration and the factors that contributed to Faraday's success in discovering the magneto-optic effect, while Herschel's experiment remained unsuccessful and overlooked. The article highlights the importance of persistence, experimental variation, and the public nature of scientific events in shaping the course of scientific discovery."}
