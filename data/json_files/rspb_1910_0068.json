They discovered that the downward movement is due to the organism's specific gravity, while the upward movement is influenced by the activity of the organisms and the upward currents set up in the liquid. The aggregation is similar to cohesion figures formed by line sediments and is likely due to the action of gravity on massed organisms combined with vortical movements. This study provides insight into the mechanics controlling microorganism movements and their advantages in maintaining circulation and preventing overcrowding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
