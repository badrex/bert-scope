The authors conducted heat content measurements on various silicate liquids and used this data to derive a consistent set of volume, enthalpy, and entropy data for liquid silicate compounds. They also calculated the equilibration pressures and temperatures of lavas with a herzolitic source material and explored the ascent of basaltic magma through the Earth's mantle and lower crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Mineralogy"}
