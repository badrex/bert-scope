Contralaterally projecting ganglion cells are generated from embryonic day E11 to about E19, while ipsilaterally projecting cells are born from E11 to E16. The findings suggest that the bilateral projection system in the retina reflects an early developmental program rather than the result of competition between the two eyes at later stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
