They also discuss radiative corrections to scattering in a weak external field and show that the charge renormalization condition leads to the same value for the coupling constant as when using the condition of vanishing radiative corrections to the Rutherford formula in the non-relativistic limit.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
