They used a spark from a large condenser battery as a light source and a quartz spectrograph to observe the Zeeman effect in fields stronger than 40,000 gauss. This method allowed them to investigate the behavior of spectral lines in strong magnetic fields, which was not possible with previous techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
