They find that the environmental effect on anion polarizability can be parametrized using the ionic separation, and propose a polynomial function to fit the logarithm of anion polarizability. This model allows for the deduction of cation polarizabilities in various compounds, providing a reliable set of ionic polarizabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
