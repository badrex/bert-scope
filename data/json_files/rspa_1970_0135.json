The nonlinear dispersion relation is obtained, which shows that the periodic dependence of frequency on wavenumber and the existence of a cutoff frequency are preserved. The expansion of the lattice is found to be positive, and the Gruneisen ratio is determined by wavenumber and force constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave mechanics"}
