The results show that the canine Purkinje strand has wide extracellular clefts, which reduce the impact of variations in extracellular ion concentration. The presence of a pacemaker current in canine Purkinje strands is significant, as it was absent in rabbit Purkinje strand studies. The voltage-clamp set-up and experimental procedures are described, and the electrophysiological properties and membrane currents are analyzed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
