They discovered that electric currents can be caused by liquid diffusion and osmosis, and the direction of the current depends on the difference in osmotic pressure between the two liquids. The author also found that the strength of the electric current is influenced by the concentration and specific gravity of the solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
