The harmonic system is used to derive tidal constants from tidal observations, and the method is demonstrated using the port of Aden as an example. This approach allows for more accurate tidal predictions and can be useful for ports with complex and irregular tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
