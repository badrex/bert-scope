It explains how these arches initially served for respiration and later became part of the alimentary system. The hyomandibula, originally a part of the suspension system, took on a new function in sound conduction and evolved into the stapes, malleus, and other auditory components. The study covers various species, from lower Selachians to higher mammals, and highlights the changes in the bones' structure and functions over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate anatomy"}
