They found correlations between staining patterns, molecular structures of dyes and intermediates, and dye solubilities. This led to the development of an improved indigogenic staining process for esterases, using 5-bromo-4-chloroindoxyl acetate, with a precision of about 0.5 \u00b5. The study also demonstrated the potential for quantitative cytochemical studies in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
