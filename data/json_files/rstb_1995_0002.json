The protein forms a helical nucleoprotein filament on single-stranded DNA, recognizing homology in duplex DNA and initiating the exchange of strands in homologous recombination. The discovery of this reaction has led to a better understanding of the importance of RecA protein in recombination and repair processes in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
