They found that a mixed culture of Azotobacter and Pseudomonas can increase the nitrogen content in the soil, which is beneficial for plant growth. This discovery could potentially improve agricultural practices by increasing soil fertility.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Soil Microbiology"}
