They explore the differences in the fibers' responses to various conditions, such as organic affections, freezing, and anesthesia. The study aims to understand why abductor fibers are more prone to succumb before adductors in certain nerve affections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
