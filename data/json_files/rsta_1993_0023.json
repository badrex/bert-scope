The low-pressure chemical vapor deposition (CVD) technique offers more flexibility, lower cost, and better performance compared to high-pressure methods. The potential applications of these coatings include cutting tools, anti-wear parts, and decorative surfaces. The article also compares in-situ CVD coating and bonding of freestanding diamond sheets, highlighting their advantages and limitations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
