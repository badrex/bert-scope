They found that the concentration dependence of surface diffusion coefficients agrees with a treatment that relates it to the slope of the isotherm. The authors also explained the behavior of fluxes at different pressures and temperatures in terms of the influence of temperature on surface diffusion and concentration gradients.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
