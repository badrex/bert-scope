This sequence reveals complex polymorphic patterns in the Accipitridae family, allowing for the development of a sexing technique and monitoring matriarchal success and dispersion. The study also provides evidence of a dramatic bottleneck in the Welsh population and possible introgression from the continent.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
