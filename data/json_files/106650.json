They discovered that the air near the ground is colder at night, especially in valleys, and this phenomenon is influenced by clear skies and atmospheric pressure. The author also found that moisture in the air, such as dew and fog, can increase the refrigeration effect. These findings contribute to a better understanding of local heat and atmospheric conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
