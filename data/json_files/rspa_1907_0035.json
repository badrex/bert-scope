They found that the absence of water vapor does not influence the explosion of a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen once the flame has been started by a spark. The results showed that the explosion phenomena in both moist and dry gases were identical.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
