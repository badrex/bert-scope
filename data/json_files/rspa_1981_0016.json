The research focuses on ten H-group chondrites and examines their mineral compositions, crystal-liquid equilibria, and post-accretion crystallization. The findings suggest that the mineral chemistry of these meteorites is primarily the result of crystal-liquid equilibria during chondrule solidification and accretion, with the degree of post-accretion crystallization being a function of the rate of cooling.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteoritics"}
