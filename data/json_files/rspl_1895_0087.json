He suggests using a metal plate with insulated electrodes to create pressural disturbances or longitudinal waves. The experiment could potentially demonstrate the truth of Rontgen's hypothesis regarding his discovery of X-rays. The author also considers alternative explanations for the observed phenomena and emphasizes the importance of further research in this field."}
