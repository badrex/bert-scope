He observes that blood corpuscles undergo changes in form and size, and that these changes are due to an inherent power rather than cilia. He also discusses the role of blood corpuscles in the formation of the corpus luteum and the similarities between the formation of the Graafian vesicle and the blood-corpuscles. Furthermore, he describes the origin of pigmentum nigrum and the composition of the spermatozoon and the ovum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
