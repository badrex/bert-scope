Matteucci, conducted experiments on the electrical phenomena accompanying muscle contraction. They discovered that during muscle contraction, there is an instantaneous electrical discharge in a contrary direction to the relaxed muscle's current. This finding challenges M. du Bois-Reymond's theory that the electrical phenomena are due to the momentary predominance of currents from the polarization of the electrodes. The author also provides a detailed experimental setup and apparatus for replicating these experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
