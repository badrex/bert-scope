The author explains the structure and function of these anion exchange proteins, which have a bifunctional active site that binds a pair of negative charges. The article also explores the implications of these findings for the larger class of secondary carriers in bacteria and eukaryotic organelles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Membrane Biology"}
