It explains how bacterial reaction centres, which are the site of electronic energy conversion to chemical potential, can be used to study the process of electron transfer. The study found that an electron is removed from the primary donor in less than 10 picoseconds and transferred to the ubiquinone acceptor in several stages. The reverse electron transfer is much slower, leading to a quantum efficiency close to 100% for primary charge separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
