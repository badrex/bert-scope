They use integral equations of Abel's type to determine the refractive index distribution inside the lenses that bring rays to a focus. The spherical lens solution is derived from a different approach than Luneberg's, and numerical results are provided for various cases. The cylindrical lens solution is found to be simple and applicable with minimal computation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
