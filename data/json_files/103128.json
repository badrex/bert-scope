The author, Ralph Thoresby, described the event and its effects on the local population. The meteor appeared to move from south to north and was seen by people in various locations. It was described as a hot, dry, and sulphurous exhalation, and its sudden brightness caused people to see their own shadows even without sunlight or moonlight.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
