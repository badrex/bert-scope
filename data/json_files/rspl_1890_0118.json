They found that the passivity of metals, including wrought iron and various types of steel, is influenced by their chemical composition and physical structure. The experiments also showed that the passivity of metals can change over time, with wrought iron generally being less passive than steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
