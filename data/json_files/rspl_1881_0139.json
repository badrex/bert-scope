They suggest that studying the \"viscosity\" of a metal through torsional vibrations could provide valuable information about its electrical resistance. The author also discusses the uncertainty in understanding the state of a fluid near its critical temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Metallurgy"}
