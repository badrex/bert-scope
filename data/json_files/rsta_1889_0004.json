They found that the composition of the \"hydrate\" of propyl alcohol depends on the pressure under which the liquid is distilled. The author also determined the vapour-pressures of varying mixtures of propyl alcohol and water at different temperatures, and concluded that there is no chemical combination between propyl alcohol and water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
