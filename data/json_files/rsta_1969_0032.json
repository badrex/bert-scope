This theory investigates the properties of shape subgroups and provides a basis for studying free polynilpotent groups. The author also applies the theory to Lie rings and demonstrates that the corresponding factor groups are residually nilpotent.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
