They found that the conductivity of salt vapors is of an electrolytic character, but it has features that distinguish it from electrolytic conduction in aqueous solutions. The conductivity of different salts varies based on their electropositive constituent, and the conductivity of haloid salts and oxy-salts behaves differently."}
