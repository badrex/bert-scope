They observe that some cells, like Craigie's paramorphic cells, are more resistant to freezing and show fewer ice-crystal spaces. The author suggests that this resistance could help determine which cells are more likely to survive freezing and be viable for transplantation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
