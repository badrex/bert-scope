The experiments show that a prominent seam inclined at a slight angle to the direction of projection, along with a smooth surface and a small amount of back-spin, can cause the ball to swing. The phenomenon is influenced by transient effects, leading to variations in swing even with new balls.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
