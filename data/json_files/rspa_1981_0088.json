They discuss the Deal-Grove equation for thermal oxidation and the role of oxygen and water in the oxidation process. The author also explores the anodic oxidation process and the Cabrera-Mott mechanism, which involves electron tunneling through the oxide film and the formation of charged species, such as silicon vacancies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
