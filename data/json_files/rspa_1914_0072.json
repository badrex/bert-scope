Thompson, investigates the phenomenon of intermittences observed in revolving sector discs. He finds that a slight mechanical shock, whether given to the head, body, or mirror, causes an enhanced brightness of stationary white sectors. Thompson concludes that this is not due to a temporary paralysis of vision, but rather, the moving images of the white sectors on the retina fall on more sensitive rods and cones when shifted by a minute displacement.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Sensory Perception"}
