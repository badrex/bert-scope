The authors explore the relationship between heat production and the action potential, considering various physical and chemical processes that may contribute to the observed heat changes. They discuss the 'condenser theory' as a possible explanation for the initial heat production, which attributes the positive heat to the energy released by the membrane capacitance during the action potential, and the negative heat to the recharging of the capacitance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
