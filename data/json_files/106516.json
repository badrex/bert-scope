He used a three-foot achromatic telescope to determine the right ascensions and declinations of these stars. Pigott also developed a method to observe faint stars by using the transit instrument's wires, which could potentially be useful for other astronomers. The article includes the coordinates of the discovered double stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
