They discovered that the lattice stress-strain curve exhibits three main characteristics: initial proportional contraction, slowing down of contraction after the yield point, and eventual expansion at higher stresses. These findings provide insights into the internal strains in metals and the permanent deformation of the lattice after loading.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
