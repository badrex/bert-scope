The research shows that these fish have a narrow medulla oblongata with small facial and vagal lobes, but a prominent central acoustic area, which is an auditory center in the brain. This structure is a result of their sight-feeding habits, making them more active and alert than bottom-feeding fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
