The authors found that the ionization current observed in the chambers depends on the material of the walls, and they discuss the factors affecting the secondary electronic emission from the walls. The study has implications for measuring the energy absorbed in living tissues when exposed to penetrating radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
