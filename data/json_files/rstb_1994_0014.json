It highlights that while the sea has a higher phylum diversities, terrestrial ecosystems have more species. The author also addresses recent revisions in species estimates for tropical invertebrates, fungi, and microorganisms, and discusses the possible reasons for the land-sea disjunction in species and phylum diversities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
