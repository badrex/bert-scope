They provide a step-by-step guide for staining, discussing the importance of various reagents, techniques, and conditions to achieve consistent and reliable staining results. This method allows researchers to study the structure and organization of cat retinae, particularly the alpha cells, which play a crucial role in visual processing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
