The technique involves trapping a fluid in a point contact between a ball and a flat surface, then measuring the refractive index to determine the fluid's density, pressure, and viscosity. This method allows for the measurement of extremely high viscosities and provides valuable insights into the behavior of fluids under high pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
