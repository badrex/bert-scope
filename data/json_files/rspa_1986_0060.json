These new solutions depend on a single characteristic variable and are applicable to cases with finite linear damping and complex coupling coefficients. The findings expand the understanding of non-conservative equations and their applications in various physical contexts.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
