The photometer uses a bichromated gelatin process to create a thin membrane from a photographic plate, which is then used as an obstacle to a beam of alpha particles. This method allows for more accurate and efficient intensity measurements in crystal structure analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
