They propose two control strategies, one utilizing temperature sensors and thermal actuators, and the other using velocity sensors and actuators. Linear stability analysis shows that the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of convection can be increased with the aid of the controller, delaying the transition to motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
