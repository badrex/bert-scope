They discuss various measurements and angles of the skull, including the cranial index, frontal and orbito-frontal angles, and the fronto-parietal index. The Gibraltar skull, unique among Neandertal specimens, is analyzed in detail, revealing its distinct facial features and orbit characteristics. The cranial capacity of the Neandertal race is estimated to be around 1250 cubic centimeters, similar to that of some South Australian skulls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Evolution"}
