The authors found that while the symptoms of poisoning are similar, they differ in relative degree, leading them to question whether they can be considered identical in the future. They also found that Calmette's antivenomous serum is ineffective against krait venom. The study concludes that the minimum lethal dose of krait venom varies among different animals and that the venom has a direct effect on skeletal muscle and nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Toxicology"}
