They explore the question of whether chromosome changes cause or result from speciation and examine the role of reproductive biology and population structure in karyotypic change. The author also highlights the importance of chromosome banding techniques in studying chromosomal polymorphism and evaluating chromosomal changes in evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
