The authors conducted experiments using a wind tunnel to examine the effects of various parameters, such as Mach number, Reynolds number, and shock strength. They found that the nature of the interaction depends on the state of the boundary layer, and their findings provide a clearer understanding of the broader features of the interaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
