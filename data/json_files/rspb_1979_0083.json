According to this theory, it is advantageous for higher organisms to have reduced accuracy in somatic cells to accelerate development and reproduction, leading to eventual deterioration and death. In contrast, a high level of accuracy is maintained in immortal germ line cells. This theory can be tested by measuring accuracy in germ line and somatic cells and comparing somatic cells from mammals with different longevities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
