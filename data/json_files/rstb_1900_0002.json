The system divides ferns into three main groups: Simplices (with simultaneous sporangia origin), Gradates (with basipetal sporangia succession), and Mixtes (with sporangia of various ages intermixed). This classification is supported by additional evidence from anatomy and gametophyte details.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
