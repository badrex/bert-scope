The anion channel, GCAC1, is activated by voltage, calcium, and nucleotides, and is involved in processes such as stomatal movement and ion movement. The article also explores the effect of growth hormones, such as auxins, on the anion channel, revealing that auxin binding can shift the activation potential and gate the channel.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
