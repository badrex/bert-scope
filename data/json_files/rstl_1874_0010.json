They found that certain explosive compounds behave differently when detonated, and the facility of detonation is not always proportional to the mechanical force and heat developed by the explosion. The author suggests that a similarity in character or synchronism of vibrations may favor the detonation of one substance by another, and that different explosive agents develop different types of vibrations that can affect their detonation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Explosives"}
