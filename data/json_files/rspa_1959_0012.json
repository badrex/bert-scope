They determined the sizes of the convection cells that appear at marginal stability and confirmed the theoretical predictions of Chandrasekhar regarding the wave number of the disturbance. The experiments also showed a discontinuous change in the wave number when transitioning from cellular convection to overstable convection under the combined action of magnetic fields and rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
