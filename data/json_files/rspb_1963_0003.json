The researchers found that platelets in the white head of the thrombus are closely packed and retain their organelles, while platelets at the periphery have lost their granules. The tight packing and loss of granules occur early in the formation of the thrombus and precede widespread fibrin formation. The study provides insights into the process of blood clotting and the role of platelets in thrombosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
