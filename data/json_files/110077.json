They selected two open and elevated spots in the plains of Utrecht, and measured the interval between seeing a light signal and hearing the sound using clocks with conical pendulums. They also used barometers, thermometers, and hygrometers to measure atmospheric conditions. The results showed that at a temperature of 32\u00b0F, the velocity of sound is 1,089-7,445 English feet per sexagesimal second.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
