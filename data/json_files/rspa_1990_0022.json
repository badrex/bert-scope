They study the transient basin approach, which focuses on the basin boundaries and their erosion, providing a more relevant method for analyzing engineering systems in noisy or ill-defined environments. The research highlights the importance of understanding fractal boundaries and their impact on the safe parameter regime for designing and maintaining stable systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Control Systems"}
