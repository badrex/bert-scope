The authors examine the oscillatory patterns of behavior and analyze limit cycles and non-stationary states. They find that a supercritical Hopf bifurcation occurs, leading to stable limit cycles and sustained oscillations in the concentrations of the reacting species. The amplitude of these oscillations increases as the residence time increases, while the period between peaks lengthens and the oscillations become more spiky in character.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
