They discover gland cells in the stomodaeum and the absence of the six ventral and lateral mesenterial filaments, which are usually present in Alcyonacea. The author suggests that the gland cells in the stomodaeum may perform a digestive function, and that the absence of the mesenterial filaments is correlated with the presence of these gland cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
