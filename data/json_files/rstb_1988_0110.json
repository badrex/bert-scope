It explains how global and tissue-specific sex-determining genes work together to control the development of male and female characteristics in the organism. The author focuses on the role of genes such as fog-1, tra-2, and fem-3 in directing the differentiation of germ cells into sperm or oocytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
