The results show that these receptors can modulate currents evoked by nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) and GABA receptors (GABARs) via calcium-dependent intracellular mechanisms. This finding indicates that muscarinic receptors can exert a powerful modulatory influence on neurons with these receptors co-localized.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
