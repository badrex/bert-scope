They find that the loss of stability of steady, planar combustion waves occurs via Hopf bifurcation for large values of a parameter related to the activation energy of the reaction. The study shows that chaotic solutions can be predicted from nonlinear stability theory near multiple eigenvalue points, leading to a better understanding of complex combustion phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
