The authors develop a method to construct work-hardening slipline fields based on experimental flow patterns and analyze the differences between observed flow patterns and forces and those predicted by classical plasticity theory. The research provides insights into the behavior of work-hardening materials during extrusion and can help improve the understanding of metal extrusion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
