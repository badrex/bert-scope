They found that the critical field decreases with decreasing temperature and that the coefficient b, which corresponds to Kapitza's $, is independent of the purity of the specimen and varies with temperature alone. The results provide insights into the behavior of metals under strong magnetic fields and contribute to the understanding of the magneto-resistance effect in materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
