W. Hofmann investigates the properties and reactions of mixed triammonias containing monatomic and diatomic radicals. He explores the formation and composition of various nitrogen-based compounds, including diethylene-triamine, triethylene-triamine, and diethylene-diethyldiamine. Hofmann also examines the crystalline structures and solubilities of these compounds in water and alcohol, as well as their reactions with platinum and gold salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
