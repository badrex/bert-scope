This method does not depend on achieving a balance between relaxation rates and has been applied to study the Ce-W system in (Ca, Ce) at very low radio frequencies. The technique offers advantages over conventional methods, such as independence from lattice relaxation and freedom from control by unknown material parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
