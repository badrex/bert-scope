They discover that colony formation occurs through intra-tentacular budding, which results in the cyclic polystomodaeal condition. This condition can become discontinuous due to the appearance of concentric and radial ridges, leading to the formation of various polyp structures. The study compares the colony formation in Fungid corals to that of Astraeid corals, highlighting the differences in their growth patterns and polyp structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Coral Biology"}
