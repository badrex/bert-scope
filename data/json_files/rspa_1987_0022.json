The study focuses on radiative gravitational fields in general relativity and their asymptotic behavior at future null infinity. The findings provide confidence that isolated systems generate space-time solutions of Einstein's equations that are asymptotically simple.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
