These segments show allocyclic behavior and are undercharged with nucleic acid during mitosis and meiosis. The availability of nucleic acid at the stage when chromosomes normally spiralize is a condition for that spiralization. Heterochromatin seems to be confined to parts of chromosomes where chiasmata and crossing-over rarely occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
