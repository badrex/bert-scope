They found that the thermal expansion of these salts in the c-axis direction can be as large as in the parent graphite. The three nitrates show a thermal expansion anomaly at around 200\u00b0C, which may be due to a phase transformation in the crystals. This research provides insights into the interaction forces between intercalates and the macro-aromatic molecules in graphite salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
