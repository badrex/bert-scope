These actions are essential for understanding the nature of classical linear and angular momentum in radiating space-times. The study also provides a uniform manner for analyzing these groups and their actions on spaces interpreted as 'blow-ups' at the origin of parts of punctured flat spaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
