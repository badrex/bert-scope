It examines the impact of tree species on soil fertility, nutrient cycling, and soil genesis, and highlights the importance of understanding these factors for effective forest management. The article also reviews the limitations of current nutrient cycle models and emphasizes the need for more research to better understand soil development and its relationship with forest ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
