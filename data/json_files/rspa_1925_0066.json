They observe a unique discharge with intense luminosity and high-pitched sound, and find that the dielectric strength of the gas mixture reaches a maximum at a certain pressure. The research focuses on the chemical effects and electrical factors involved in the process, providing a detailed description of the experimental setup and methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
