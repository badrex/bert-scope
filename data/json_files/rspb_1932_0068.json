They found that 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, a specific type of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, was highly effective in producing cancer in mice. This discovery led to further research on the relationship between hydrocarbons and cancer development.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Carcinogens"}
