The study of the amphibian egg and transplantation experiments have provided insights into the regulability of the nervous system during development. The author also examines the neurone concept and its relation to the cell theory, as well as the formation of nerve fibers and their responses to environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
