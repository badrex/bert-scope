The proboscis is a complex structure that involves flexible endocuticle, rigid exocuticle, muscles, internal septa, and haemocoelic turgidity. The study concludes that existing theories on proboscis extension must be rejected, as extension is not caused by inflation, direct muscle action, or elasticity of the proboscis wall.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
