The authors compare their calculations with Filon's work, considering both the Oseen approximation and the Prandtl equations. They find that the first asymptotic approximation remains the same, while the second approximation in this paper contains additional terms. The study provides insights into the behavior of fluid flow near solid objects and the onset of turbulence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
