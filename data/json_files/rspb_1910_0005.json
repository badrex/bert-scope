They classify the fins into three main types: protocercal, heterocercal, and homocercal, and discuss their internal and external symmetries, endoskeletal supports, and evolutionary development. The study provides a clearer understanding of the caudal fin's role in fish anatomy and taxonomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
