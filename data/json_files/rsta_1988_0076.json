The planetary collision hypothesis, which explains various features of asteroids, meteorites, and comets, is proposed as a plausible alternative to the nebula theory. The hypothesis accounts for isotopic anomalies, the formation of chondrules, and the rapid heating and cooling observed in the early Solar System.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth and Environmental Sciences > Planetary Science"}
