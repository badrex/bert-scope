The authors developed an experimental method to determine the thermal emissivity of a leaf-lamina and found that the loss of heat from radiation and air convection varies with the size and shape of the cooling body. The study also highlights the importance of air currents in affecting heat transfer from and to the leaf.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
