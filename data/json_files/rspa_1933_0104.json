The authors study the dough's mechanical properties, such as elastic after-effect and hysteresis, and find that these properties are essential for understanding the dough's behavior. They also discuss the challenges in measuring these properties and propose a method to obtain more accurate values for the relaxation time and viscosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
