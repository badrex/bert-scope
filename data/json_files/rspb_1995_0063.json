This suggests that aphids determine the details of gall morphology, rather than plants. The findings also reveal at least three instances of host plant switches where aphids produce galls most similar to those of their closest relatives, rather than galls similar to those produced by other aphids already present on the host plant.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
