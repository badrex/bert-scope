They confirmed the presence of a charge compensating interstitial ion and measured the hyperfine interactions with next neighbors. The results provided information about the distortion of the lattice due to the interstitial ion and helped to understand the covalent bonding effects in the crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
