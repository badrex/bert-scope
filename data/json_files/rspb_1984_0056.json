The results show that the sodium channel density decreases significantly after crush, suggesting that central glial cells, such as astrocytes and oligodendrocytes, do not bind saxitoxin. The findings indicate that the saturable binding of saxitoxin to the rabbit optic nerve is entirely to the axolemma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
