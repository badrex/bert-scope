They found that removing the anterior lobe of the pituitary gland led to atrophy of the gonads and secondary sexual characters in male birds, while the effects on female birds were less certain due to variations in reproductive activity. The study also showed that the testes of hypophysectomized birds experienced significant regression and shrinkage, while the vas deferens showed differences in size and lining epithelium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
