He discovered that these differences were caused by the ship's head being in different directions. Flinders also offered conjectures about the cause of these differences, suggesting that the attractive power of substances in a ship could affect the compass and that this effect might be stronger near the ship's center.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
