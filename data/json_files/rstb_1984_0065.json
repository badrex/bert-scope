The soil mediates the effects of these compounds by adsorbing sulfate and nitrate, which can either mitigate or exacerbate the effects of acid deposition. The ultimate effects of atmospheric sulfur and nitrogen deposition are site-specific and depend on site characteristics and the amount and duration of atmospheric inputs.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Chemistry"}
