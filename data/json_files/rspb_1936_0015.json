They found that the agreement between the calculated curve and experimental points was usually very good, with an average divergence of only 2%. This research provided a better understanding of the relationship between the strength and duration of electrical stimulation needed to excite nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
