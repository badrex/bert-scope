Herschel, investigates the action of crystallized bodies on homogeneous light and the causes of deviation from Newton's scale in the tints developed by crystals when exposed to polarized rays. He discovers that the axes of double refraction in crystals differ in position for different colored rays of the spectrum, leading to a new element in the formulae of double refraction. This finding supports the theory of oscillations as a general and simple physical law.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
