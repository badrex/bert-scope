This is supported by mass ratio comparisons. The Earth's interior shells are inferred to be made up of silicate minerals and sulfur-based iron alloys, similar to the components of enstatite chondrites. This theory helps explain the Earth's density differences and the composition of its interior shells.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
