The researchers found that males with functional gin traps had a higher mating success when their hind wings were removed, suggesting that the gin trap allows males to force copulations on unwilling females. This discovery provides evidence of an adaptation in males that has evolved in the context of coercive mating.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
