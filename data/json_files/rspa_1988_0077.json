This study investigates the propagation of destabilization in periodic systems with marginally stable elements, focusing on toppling caused by a group of neighboring elements that interact as they topple. The authors find that there is an intrinsic or natural speed for the propagation of destabilization if potential energy is released by toppling, and the speed of propagation approaches this natural speed as toppling progresses through the array.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
