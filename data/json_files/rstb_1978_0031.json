It explores histone variants in sea urchins and their potential role in development. The authors also describe the cloning of histone DNA and the molecular structure of the histone DNA repeat unit. They emphasize the importance of understanding the regulation of histone genes to better understand development and differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
