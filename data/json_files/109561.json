He found that the essential components of these ores were calx of zinc, carbonic acid, and water. Smithson also proposed a theory about the simplicity of nature and chemical combinations, suggesting that only a few essential ingredients are needed for compounds, and these ingredients are in a specific proportion. This theory could lead to a more accurate and rigorous approach in chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
