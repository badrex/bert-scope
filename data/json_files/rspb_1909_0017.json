They found that immune serum from severe cases of diseases like typhoid fever and pneumonia can cause hemolysis in normal red blood cells. The study also examines the role of splenic extract in hemolysis and phagocytosis of red blood cells. The results provide insights into the immune response and blood disorders in different diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
