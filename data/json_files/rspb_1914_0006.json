They found that the cholesterol content in chickens remained relatively constant regardless of the diet, suggesting that cholesterol is a conserved substance in the animal organism. The study also showed that chickens could thrive on a diet devoid of cholesterol and phytosterol.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
