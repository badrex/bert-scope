These coins were made of pewter and had little intrinsic value, but were inscribed with the phrase \"Melioris tessera fati,\" meaning \"a better portion of fate.\" The coins were never officially proclaimed as legal tender, as King William's victory at the Battle of the Boyne prevented it. Thoresby mentions that he found a bag of 150 of these rare pieces in the treasury at Dublin.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Numismatics"}
