The author observes the splitting and displacement of lines under the influence of electric fields and discusses the differences in behavior between the violet and red sides of the spectrum. The findings contribute to the understanding of the Stark effect and its impact on atomic spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
