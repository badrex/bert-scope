It highlights the similarities between Comenius and John Wilkins' views on scientific method and the desirability of a universal language. The author argues that the contrast in their ideas is not between Baconian empiricism and Comenian Pansophia, but between Comenian Pansophia and the Cartesian attitude of mind.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
