They analyze various substances, such as nacreous bodies, snail blue glass, and green sap of plants, to study the effects of absorption on the spectrum. The author discovers that the two classes of phenomena, absorption and thin plates, have no connecting link besides producing a divided or mutilated spectrum, highlighting the differences between them.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
