He examines the influence of motion, distance, and imperfect conductors on the protective effect of metals. Davy also explores the importance of selecting pure copper, applying it smoothly, and using copper nails for attachment to ensure effective protection against corrosion and marine growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Marine Engineering"}
