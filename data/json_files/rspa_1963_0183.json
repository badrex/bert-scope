They introduce the concept of internal angular momentum and polyadic polarization densities to represent the point structure of the continuum. The theory is applied to structured continua with subcontinuum mass and charge distributions, leading to expressions for proper mass density, mass flux density, and moment of mass flux (angular momentum).", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
