They found that the presence of grit particles and gas bubbles can increase the sensitivity of the explosives. The study also revealed that the ready propagation of the explosion is associated with the covalent character of the molecules. The results suggest that the rapid propagation of the explosion is due to the recombination of excited or atomic nitrogen at or near the surface of the explosive.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Explosives and Pyrotechnics"}
