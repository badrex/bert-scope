The authors use numerical simulations of the Navier-Stokes equations to analyze the process of detonation formation, focusing on the interaction between chemical energy release and changes in pressure, temperature, and density. The research provides insights into the essential mechanisms of direct initiation processes and helps quantify the energy and power requirements for detonation initiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
