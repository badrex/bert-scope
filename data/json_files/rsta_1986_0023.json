It discusses the detection and study of geophysical lineaments using various remote sensing techniques, such as gravimetry, magnetometry, and seismology. The author highlights the importance of understanding the deep structure of the lithosphere and the role of lineaments in shaping the Earth's crust through processes like faulting, shearing, and plate tectonics.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Tectonics"}
