They found that ammonia could not be synthesized using glass or porcelain vessels and that the presence of moisture and certain metals, such as iron, could lead to the formation of ammonia. The authors also observed that the amount of ammonia produced depended on the amount of moisture present and the temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and synthesis"}
