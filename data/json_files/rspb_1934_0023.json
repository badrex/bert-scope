They used benzol injections to reduce the number of circulating white blood cells and vital dye injections to mark cells of the reticulo-endothelial system. The results showed that dust cells were derived from the alveolar epithelium, supporting the idea that they play a role in the body's defense against particulate matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
