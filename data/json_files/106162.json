The incident provided a clear demonstration of the similarities between lightning and electrical fluid, as well as the role of gilded surfaces in conducting the electrical charge. Hamilton's account offers valuable insights into the behavior of lightning and its effects on buildings during thunderstorms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
