They use first-order nonlinear wave theory to explain the formation of surface gradient discontinuities and provide examples of practical importance that illustrate the theory. This theory has applications in surface analysis, ion beam processing, and microfabrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
