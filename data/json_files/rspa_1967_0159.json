The authors analyze the Hartmann boundary layer, the mainstream, and the complicated boundary-layer singularity at specific points on the wall. They provide a formal solution and use boundary-layer methods to determine the behavior of the fluid and induced magnetic field in different regions of the pipe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
