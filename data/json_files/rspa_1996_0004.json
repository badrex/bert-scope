The author uses the Galerkin method to solve the derived pair of integro-differential equations and presents the stress intensity magnification factors in graphical form for various crack aspect ratios, thickness-to-semi-minor axis ratios, and shear stress directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
