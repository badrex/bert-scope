They found that bacteriophages are highly sensitive to the combined action of methylene blue and light, and that the presence of living organisms can protect the bacteriophages from inactivation. This research provides insights into the mechanisms of photodynamic action and potential applications in the treatment of bacterial infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
