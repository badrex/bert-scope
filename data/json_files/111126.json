The author, Henry Bence Jones, found that when ammonia is taken in, it is converted into nitric acid, which is then excreted in the urine. The presence of nitric acid was also detected in the products of various combustions, including alcohol, coal, and hydrogen, as well as in rainwater. This research highlights the importance of oxygen in the body's metabolism and the role of nitrogen in combustion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
