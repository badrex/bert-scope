They present methods for calculating these effects and demonstrate improvements in predicting orbital elements and the time a satellite will pass through a given point in its orbit. This research is relevant for understanding and planning satellite-based research projects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
