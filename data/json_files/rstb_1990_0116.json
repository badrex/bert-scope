The research provides evidence of the vegetational development during temperate stages in northwest Europe, with a focus on the early middle Pleistocene interglacial deposits. The findings contribute to the understanding of the Cromerian sensu stricto and the late Beestonian periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
