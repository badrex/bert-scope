This approach solves the Schr\u00f6dinger equation by expressing the perturbation energy in powers of the perturbation, providing a straightforward derivation of the older and recent perturbation expansions. The method is demonstrated for time-independent and time-dependent Hamiltonians, and the results are compared with the interaction representation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
