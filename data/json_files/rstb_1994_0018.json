Two distinct channels mediating residual vision are discovered: one responds to spatial structure, and the other to light flux changes. The study also measures the amount of light scatter in the eye and concludes that scattered light cannot account for the results obtained with the stimuli used to characterize the residual vision of the patient.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Neuroscience"}
