Researchers manipulated cover availability and food location in aviaries and found that birds with cover had lower levels of fluctuating asymmetry and fewer fault bars in their primary feathers, indicating reduced stress. Food location also had a weak influence on asymmetry, but did not affect the number of fault bars. These results suggest that habitat structure can influence stress in birds, and may impact plumage development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
