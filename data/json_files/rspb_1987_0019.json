Catecholamines increase the initial rate of reactivation, while acetylcholine slows down recovery. These neurotransmitters control the local calcium concentration near the inner surface of the channels, affecting the reactivation process and influencing the heart's rate and response to drugs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
