The experiments show that these compounds can cause muscles of cold preparations to respond repetitively to a single nerve volley, while warm preparations show no such response. The study also examines the effects of calcium-deficient solutions and prostigmine on the responses of frog nerve-muscle preparations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
