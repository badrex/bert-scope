They discovered that the culture contained a mixture of variants with different degrees of flocculence. By examining sedimentation times, the author found that some variants gave rise to other variants during subculture, and the proportion of less flocculent yeast increased over time. This study provides insights into the genetic and physical properties of yeast and their impact on flocculence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
