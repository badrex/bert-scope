They applied this method to measure the diffusivities of hydrogen and nitrobenzoic acid in water and compared the results with Taylor's method of analysis. The experiments were performed in coiled tubes, and the influence of the tube curvature on the diffusivities was discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
