The model simulates soil moisture conditions, crop growth, and production, considering factors such as climate, soil type, and farm management. The study focused on potatoes and spring cereals grown on different soil types in the Netherlands over a 30-year period, providing a basis for evaluating the effects of soil and drainage on crop yields and informing land evaluation studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
