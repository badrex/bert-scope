The authors measure the isotope shifts in the arc line 3405 A for all even isotopes of palladium using enriched samples. They find that the ratio of shifts for a given sequence of neutron numbers agrees fairly closely with other elements, allowing for the derivation of information on nuclear deformation over a wider range of neutron numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
