The research finds that shortage of glucose during growth and serial subculture in a synthetic medium lead to initial delays in the decline of the bacterial population. The study also suggests that low permeability and co-operative protective effects are not the main causes of delayed lethal action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
