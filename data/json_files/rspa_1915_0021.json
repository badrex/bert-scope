They find that certain catalysts, such as copper and phosphorus, can promote the formation of active nitrogen, which is associated with a glow in the gas. The author also discusses the controversy surrounding the role of oxygen in the formation of active nitrogen and presents their experimental findings on the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
