They prove that when diffusion is neglected, the system is hyperbolic and investigate the changes of concentrations and affinities across shocks. The author also demonstrates that a transformation that decouples the system in the homovalent case does not exist for mixtures of heterovalent ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": ">-"}
