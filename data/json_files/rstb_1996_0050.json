The author presents experiments that support the idea that TBP recruitment to a promoter can activate expression, and provides further evidence that the transcriptional repressor Even-skipped interacts with TBP. This highlights the importance of TBP in both activation and repression mechanisms in gene regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
