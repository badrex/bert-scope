The study finds that the bifurcation of Taylor vortex flow in finite cylinders is two-sided, and the interaction of the two most dangerous modes of linear theory is explored. The results provide insights into the behavior of fluid dynamics in finite systems and have implications for understanding and controlling instabilities in engineering and industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
