He used various objects, such as pins and silver and sealing-wax globules, to test the telescope's capabilities. The results showed that a telescope with sufficient power can show the disk of a faint object when the angle it subtends at the naked eye is as small as 0\u00b0653.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
