It discusses the classical limit and the semi-classical limiting form of the Wigner function for integrable and non-integrable systems. The study reveals that Planck's constant plays a different role in integrable and non-integrable systems, imposing oscillatory quantum fine structure on a smooth classical background in the former and quantum smoothing on a classical background with fine structure on arbitrarily small scales in the latter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
