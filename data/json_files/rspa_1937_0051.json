They determined the energy efficiency for the excitation of hydrogen molecules and found a satisfactory agreement between experimental and theoretical values. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of molecules and plasmas in electric fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
