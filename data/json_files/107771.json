They discovered that the liver plays a crucial role in the nutrition of the fetus, producing an albuminous matter that is absorbed in the small intestines. This finding challenges previous theories about the source of nutrition for fetuses and sheds light on the development of the digestive system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
