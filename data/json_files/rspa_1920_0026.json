The method involves the polar reciprocal of a circle, with the focus of the conic being the center of reciprocation. The apparatus allows for easy adjustment of the latus rectum and eccentricity of the conic, making it a versatile tool for drawing conic sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
