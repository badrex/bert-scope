Lactis Aerogenes", "semantic_tags": ["Bacterial growth", "Anaerobic metabolism", "Oxidation-reduction processes", "Nitrogen metabolism", "Microbial metabolism"], "tldr": "The authors studied the anaerobic growth of Bact. lactis aerogenes and its relation to oxidation-reduction processes. They found that during the transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth, there is an enhancement of reducing power and an increase in acid production. The authors also discovered that the ability to support anaerobic growth depends on the presence of a nitrogen source. The findings contribute to the understanding of bacterial metabolism and the role of nitrogen in anaerobic growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
