It explores four main groups of viral genetic modification, including expression of a persisting non-integrated virus genome, integration of a virus genome into the host cell genome, and the role of viruses in the development of cancer and autoimmunity. The article highlights the importance of understanding these mechanisms for a better understanding of virus carcinogenesis and some aspects of autoimmunity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Virology"}
