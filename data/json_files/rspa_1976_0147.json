Neutron scattering experiments were used to examine the amorphous character of a rubber network and aspects of chain conformations in the network and uncrosslinked state. Networks of controlled topology were synthesized to study the shear modulus of the system, as predicted by the kinetic theory. The results provide insights into the molecular structure and behavior of rubber materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
