They divided the head into tiers and districts and compared the temperature differences between symmetrically situated spaces on both sides. The results showed that the mean difference of temperature varied between different regions and sides of the head, with the left side generally having a slightly higher temperature. The study provides insights into the temperature regulation and physiology of the human body.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
