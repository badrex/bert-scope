The author found that the barometer at the observatory was higher when the moon was on the meridian, either above or below the pole, than when she was six hours distant from the meridian. The study also examined whether any difference in the moon's influence on barometric pressure could be detected at the periods of apogee and perig\u00e9e.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
