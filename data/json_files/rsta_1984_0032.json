It compares the inclusion of guest species in zeolites, clay minerals, and clathrates, and explores the different types of sorbents and their isotherms. The article also highlights the role of clay minerals in catalyzing various reactions, such as cracking, isomerization, and redox reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
