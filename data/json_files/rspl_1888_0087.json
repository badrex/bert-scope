The author demonstrates the method's effectiveness by examining over 180 different mixtures of electrolytic substances and concludes that every electrolytic substance, when dissolved in water, unites chemically in definite proportions with other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
