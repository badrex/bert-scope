He found that seedling plants and young animals inherit more of the female parent's characteristics. In animals, the size and form of offspring are mainly regulated by the female, while the strength of the male parent is crucial for the offspring's overall adaptability. In plants, the formation of seeds depends on the male parent's influence, while in animals, the eggs attain their full size independently of the male.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
