This process leads to the continuous decrease of strain energy and surface energy as the cavity transforms from a perfectly circular hole to a hypocycloid cusp crack. The study provides a unified model of diffusive crack formation, connecting the Griffith model to cycloid surfaces and offering insights into crack initiation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
