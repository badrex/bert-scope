They found that only 30% decomposition occurred in the low-temperature range, and the remaining residue was still ammonium perchlorate. The decomposition process was influenced by factors such as temperature, particle size, and the presence of catalysts. The study provides insights into the unique characteristics of this solid decomposition reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
