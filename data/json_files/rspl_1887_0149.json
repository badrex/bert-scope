They discovered that fibrin is completely soluble in artificial gastric juice, while fibrinogen is not. This difference in behavior suggests that the relationship between lecithin and the proteins in the two substances is different. The authors also found that fibrin obtained from pure fibrinogen fluids by artificially induced coagulation is completely digestible.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Proteins and Enzymes"}
