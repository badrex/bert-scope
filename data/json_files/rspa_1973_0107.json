They obtain formulae for donor-acceptor Auger recombination rates and study their dependence on donor-acceptor separation. The results confirm that the Auger effect will be significant in GaAs and similar materials only for carrier concentrations greater than or of the order of 2.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Semiconductor Physics"}
