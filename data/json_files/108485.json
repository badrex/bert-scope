They discovered that the enamel in marsupial teeth has a high degree of tubularity, with dentinal tubes extending into the enamel. This is a distinct characteristic that sets marsupial teeth apart from other mammalian teeth. The author also notes differences in enamel structure and dental tissue composition between incisor and molar teeth in various marsupial species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
