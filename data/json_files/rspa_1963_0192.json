They analyze the spectral lifetimes and intensities of the bands, providing molecular constants and a numbering system for the chlorine bands. The study suggests that the spectra result from a two-quantum process and discusses the effects of filters, inert gases, and oxygen on the spectra. The findings contribute to the understanding of halogen chemistry and molecular physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
