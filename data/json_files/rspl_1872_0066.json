They present new calculations for \u03c0 to 709 decimals and discuss the merits of various methods, including Van Ceulen's and Hutton's formulas. The author finds that Machin's formula, used in this study, is the best method for extensive computation discovered so far.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
