They found that the anomalous synthesis provided the best approximation for structure solution, while the heavy atom synthesis and Ps(u) function also showed promising results. The study highlights the importance of using various methods to determine protein structures accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure"}
