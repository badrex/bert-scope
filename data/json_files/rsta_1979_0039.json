They used a water droplet lens to refract light and observed the resulting diffraction patterns, which were then analyzed using computer simulations and analytical methods. The study provides insights into the structure and behavior of diffraction patterns and the application of catastrophe theory to caustics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
