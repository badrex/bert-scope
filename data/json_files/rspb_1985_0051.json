The filters, containing pigments, are found in the photophores of deep-sea fish and invertebrates. These filters help in improving the color match of the light emitted by the animals with the ambient submarine daylight, aiding in camouflage. The study also discusses the nature of pigments found in these photophores and calculates the intensities of penetrating daylight, suggesting that visual acuity could be fairly good down to considerable depths in the mesopelagic zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
