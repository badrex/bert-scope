They confirmed Paschen's law, which states that electric discharge in a uniform field depends on the quantity of matter per unit cross-section between electrodes. The study also showed that the minimum spark potential is a property of the atom rather than the molecule of a gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
