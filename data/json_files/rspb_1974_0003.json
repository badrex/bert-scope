They found that the specific activities of these enzymes varied during different growth stages, with isocitrate lyase and malate synthase increasing and glycollate oxidase decreasing as the cells grew. These findings suggest that the organism could be a useful experimental system for studying microbody biogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
