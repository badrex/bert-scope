They study the presence of scandium in sunspots and solar prominences and re-determine the wavelengths of scandium lines. The author also examines the varying intensities of scandium lines and their behavior under different experimental conditions, providing insights into the principles of assigning solar lines of different classes to metallic origins.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
