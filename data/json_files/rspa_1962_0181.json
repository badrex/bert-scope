It introduces the concept of spin waves as excitations in ferromagnetic metals and shows that the low-temperature specific heat and magnetization can be expressed as the sum of two terms, one from collective electron theory and one from spin-wave theory. The article also presents a method for calculating spin-wave energies in metals, which can be more accurate than previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
