They discovered that the chemical transmitter acetylcholine (ACh) can be duplicated by iontophoretic application, and the miniature excitatory postsynaptic potentials (e.p.s.p.) resemble those at nerve-muscle junctions. This research provides insights into the release of ACh from nerve terminals and its action on the postsynaptic membrane of neurons, and is in good agreement with studies on skeletal neuromuscular junctions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
