They find that both substances reduce the rate of decomposition to the same limiting values, suggesting that the limiting rate is likely an independent non-chain process. The study also reveals differences in the efficiency of nitric oxide and propylene as inhibitors, indicating that they may react differently with various radicals involved in the reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
