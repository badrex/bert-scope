They created chimeric receptors by replacing the retinoic acid binding domain with thyroid hormone binding domain. The results showed that the a2 isoform had no activity in T3-dependent growth inhibition, while the al isoform mediated T3-dependent inhibition. This is the first direct evidence for isoform specificity in a biological response to retinoic acid, and demonstrates that the specificity of this response is confined to the A region.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
