It emphasizes the role of application programmers in load balancing and optimizing performance on parallel computers. The author also notes that the lack of progress in run-time load balancing and the limited transferability of principles across application areas and computer designs may limit the extent of parallel programming.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Computer Science"}
