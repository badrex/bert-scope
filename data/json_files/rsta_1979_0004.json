The results are in substantial agreement with previous determinations and recent calculations by Mohr, but disagree with earlier calculations by Erickson. The experimental method uses a 21 kHz beam of metastable 2S hydrogen atoms, obtained by charge exchange of a proton beam extracted from a radio frequency ion source. The experiment is performed in essentially zero magnetic field and uses a precision transmission line interaction region to induce r.f. transitions at the Lamb shift frequency. The paper discusses the method and the various corrections for systematic effects that need to be applied to the line center.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
