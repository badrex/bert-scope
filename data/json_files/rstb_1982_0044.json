The research focuses on the response of benthic macroinfaunal communities and populations to sediment hydrocarbon concentrations. The findings indicate that sediment contamination is highly dependent on spill and ecosystem variables, and that the effects of chronic low-level discharges of hydrocarbons from normal offshore petroleum operations are less severe than those resulting from major spills.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
