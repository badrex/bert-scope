They discovered that the rate of decomposition of acetaldehyde is faster than that of ether, and the reaction can be regarded as a one-stage decomposition of the ether. The authors also found that there is a surface reaction occurring alongside the main reaction, and they provided a detailed analysis of the products formed during the decomposition process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
