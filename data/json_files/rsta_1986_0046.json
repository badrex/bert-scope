The authors present a molecular modeling system, cogs, which allows users to build, modify, and analyze protein structures. The system offers various features, such as interactive building, dynamic molecule manipulation, and computational procedures for molecular mechanics, dynamics, and docking. This approach has applications in enzyme-substrate docking studies for drug design.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Biology"}
