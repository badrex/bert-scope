It demonstrates that there are universal relations between the speeds of fast and slow magnetoelastic modes, which do not depend on the exact equation of state of the body. These findings are relevant to understanding wave motion in solid stars and can be applied to various directions of the magnetic field and different magnitudes of strains.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativistic Magnetoelasticity"}
