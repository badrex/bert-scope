The authors discuss the importance of correctly formulating thermodynamics to accurately apply experimental results to natural systems. They present new methods for calculating both temperature and pressure for garnet herzolites, which reveal that these rocks formed at lower pressures than previously suggested, indicating a steeper geotherm at the time of their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
