The eyes are nearly spherical and heavily pigmented, and the authors discuss the various components of the eye, including the corneal lens, crystalline cone, and rhabdom. They also explore how the eye's structure relates to the natural history of Acetes and its adaptations to different light conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
