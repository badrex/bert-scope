It discusses the effects of vertical flux, lateral flux, and resuspension on sedimentation, as well as the challenges in interpreting the stratigraphic record due to various sedimentary processes and environmental changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Sedimentology"}
