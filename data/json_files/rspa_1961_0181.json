They found that the formation of carbonium ions and polymerization processes were different for the two reactants. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of the reactions and the role of Lewis acid sites in the formation of olefins and carbonium ions from saturated compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
