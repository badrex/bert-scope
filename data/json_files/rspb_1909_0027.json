They discovered that moderate heat has an opposite effect on tissues compared to local excitation and excessive heat, which is antidromic to the current aroused by electrical excitation. The findings suggest that the first electrical effect of moderate local heat is anti-excitatory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
