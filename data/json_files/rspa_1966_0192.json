They calculated the optical constants of aluminium and found that the critical wavelength below which aluminium is nearly transparent is 826. The optical properties are not affected by the grain size of the films. The results can be used to improve filters for rocket and satellite experiments and to understand the theory of plasma oscillations in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
