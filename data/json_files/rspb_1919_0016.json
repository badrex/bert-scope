The study shows that different drugs have varying effects on the conductivity, with atropine having no significant impact on the emotive response. The author also discusses the relationship between electrical and secretory emotive manifestations, suggesting that they may be consequences of metabolic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Electrophysiology"}
