The author, Col. James, conducted observations with Airy's Zenith Sector on the summit of Arthur's Seat and nearby locations. The results showed that the plumb-line was deflected due to the unequal distribution of matter in the surrounding area. The calculated mean density of the Earth was found to be 5.14, with a probable error of \u00b10.07.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
