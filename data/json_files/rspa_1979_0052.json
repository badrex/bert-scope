The authors present recent results from the Ariel 5 and Copernicus satellites, studying the regular periodicities in X-ray emission and the properties of various classes of sources. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms behind these systems and help provide coherent models for their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
