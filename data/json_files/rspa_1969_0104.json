The study examines the effects of ion implantation on the Mossbauer effect, including the isomer shift, hyperfine splitting, and the final environment of the excited nucleus. The results show that the average Debye-Waller factor does not differ significantly from that in an undisturbed nickel crystal, but the Coulomb excited nuclei sample a wider distribution of magnetic fields and other factors in their final positions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
