They found that fractal dimension, a measure of complexity, increased systematically with increasing shape complexity, providing a useful quantitative measure for plant development. This research can help in understanding the growth patterns and complexity of plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
