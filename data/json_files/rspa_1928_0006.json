The authors study the stability of the liquid motion and the critical speed at which the motion becomes unstable. They also explore different types of motion after the laminar motion becomes unstable and compare the speeds of the inner cylinder at which vortices come in and go out.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
