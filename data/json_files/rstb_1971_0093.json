They focus on the accumulation of ammonium ions in high concentrations in various species of squid and crustaceans, which allows them to maintain neutral buoyancy and move more efficiently in their environment. The authors also explore the mechanisms behind the formation of vacuolar tissue and the maintenance of high ammonium concentrations in these animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
