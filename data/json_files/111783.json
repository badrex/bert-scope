They found that the temperature and density showed little variation in the open sea, but were affected by currents and proximity to land. The authors also observed the temperature and density differences between the Mediterranean, Red, and Arabian Seas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
