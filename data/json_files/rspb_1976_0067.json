The study found that while hypoxia and other environmental factors influence growth, genetic influences may play a more significant role in high-altitude populations. The article highlights the importance of understanding the complex interplay between genetics and environment in shaping human growth and development in different regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Biology"}
