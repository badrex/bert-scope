Five different functional types of muscle fibers are identified, each with distinct contractile characteristics and isomyosin distributions. The results suggest that amphibian skeletal muscle may possess the principal fiber types found in mammals and birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
