They found that the yields were higher in polar solvents like ether and lower in non-polar solvents like hydrocarbons. The results suggest that the low yields in dry solvents are due to the dissociation of excited singlet dimer chlorophyll into ground state monomer species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
