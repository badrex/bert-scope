It highlights the physiological constraints to varietal improvement, such as light energy, temperature, water supply, and soil nutrients. The author emphasizes the need to identify and manipulate the key components of crop photosynthesis and harvest index to maximize yield and quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
