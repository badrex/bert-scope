This innovative technique significantly increased the efficiency of the distillation process, making it more suitable for use on ships. The method has the potential to greatly benefit navigation by allowing for faster and more fuel-efficient distillation of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval technology"}
