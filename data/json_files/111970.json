{"article_id": "111970", "revised_title": "'Stokes' Law of Intensity for Light Reflected and Transmitted through a Pile of Plates", "semantic_tags": ["Optics", "Light reflection", "Light transmission", "Polarization", "Geometric series"], "tldr": "The author, George G. Stokes, investigates the intensity of light reflected or transmitted through a pile of plates. He develops a mathematical problem to determine the relationship between the number of plates, their thickness, and their defect of transparency. Stokes' solution involves geometric series and trigonometric functions, which can be used to calculate the intensity of reflected and transmitted light in various scenarios. This work contributes to the understanding of light behavior and has implications for the design of optical devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
