They develop an integral equation for the surface charge on the interface between the polygonal inclusion and the host material. The conductivity of the sheet can be determined from the induced dipole associated with this charge distribution. The authors provide detailed results for 3, 4, and 6-sided polygons and discuss the applicability of their findings to thermal conductivity and dielectric media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
