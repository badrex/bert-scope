This effect is not observed after heating the serum, which is usually done to destroy complement. The study suggests that serum may act on nerve terminals by a mechanism involving the complement system in the absence of antibodies. The findings could have implications for understanding the composition of serum and the action of the complement system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
