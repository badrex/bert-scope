Despite having significant personal financial means, he chose to focus his studies on the unique flora and fauna of New Zealand and the surrounding Pacific region. His work spanned various scientific disciplines, including oceanography, plant ecology, and the study of New Zealand's avifauna and marine molluscs. With his passing, there are few remaining scientists in New Zealand with such strong ties to the 19th-century science of Darwin's era.", "scientific_discipline": "Biographies > New Zealand Science"}
