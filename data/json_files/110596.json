He discovered that the tubules in teeth are surrounded by a transparent material that forms a solid mass. The tubules send off minute fibrils and divide into smaller ones, which continue into the enamel or terminate at its boundary. Tomes also found another substance, the crusta petrosa, in compound teeth, similar to the bony layer of simple teeth, containing numerous corpuscles and vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
