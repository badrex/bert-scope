The study found that exposure to low doses of X-rays did not interfere with fertilization or embryonic development, while higher doses led to arrested development or complete lack of embryos and foetuses. The results showed that spermatozoa exposed to high doses lost their ability to initiate normal development of the fertilized ovum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
