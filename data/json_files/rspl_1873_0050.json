They propose that leaf arrangement is essential for economy of space in close-packed forms of plant growth, such as buds, and that this arrangement is useful for protection against temperature changes and predators. The author also explains how leaf arrangement can change through a process of condensation, which can be seen in the South African genus Gasteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
