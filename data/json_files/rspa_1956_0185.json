They found that the specific heats were due to various interaction effects that split the ground state of the magnetic ions. The results provide valuable information on the specific heat behavior of these salts at low temperatures, which is important for understanding their use as refrigerants in cryogenic experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
