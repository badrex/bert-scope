The author explores the reaction between hemoglobin and ions in the blood and discusses the Donnan equilibrium as a means to study the electrolytic properties of hemoglobin. The study provides insights into the behavior of hemoglobin as a colloidal electrolyte and its interaction with ions in the blood.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
