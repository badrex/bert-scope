The author calculates the eccentricity of the moon's orbit, the ratio of solar to lunar coefficients, and the depth of the Atlantic Ocean using tidal theories. The results provide a better understanding of the tides and their impact on the Arctic Seas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
