It identifies five antigenic sites on the hemagglutinin protein that are recognized by infectivity-neutralizing antibodies and describes how these sites change during the antigenic drift of influenza viruses. The article also explores the recognition of hemagglutinin by helper T cells and how their specificities overlap with antibody recognition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
