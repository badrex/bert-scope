They discuss the existence of a semiannual inequality in the Earth's magnetic dip, which affects the measurements. The author also compares the results with previous observations and analyzes the possible causes of discrepancies. The study provides insights into the behavior of Earth's magnetic field and the accuracy of measurements at the time."}
