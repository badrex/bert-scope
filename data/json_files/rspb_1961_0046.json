They found that this substance is stable at low pH and is destroyed by penicillinase, suggesting that it is a type of penicillin. The authors also identified the presence of penicillin amidase activity in the culture, which supports the formation of 6-aminopenicillanic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
