They find that the presence of chromium is essential for the production of the red fluorescence of alumina. The author conducts several experiments to purify the aluminum sulfate and separate chromium from alumina, proving that chromium plays a crucial role in the phosphorescence and spectrum of alumina.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
