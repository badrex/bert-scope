The author examines different measures of magnetic disturbance and their relation to sunspot frequency, finding a remarkable uniformity in the values for declination. The results suggest that the formula E = a + 6S, where E is a magnetic quantity and S is sunspot frequency, can be applied to various magnetic data, but its accuracy decreases with more disturbed magnetic quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
