The formation of uroporphyrinogen III is catalyzed by a dual enzymic system, porphobilinogen deaminase and uroporphyrinogen III cosynthase. The author explains the different reaction schemes and mechanisms involved in the formation of both uroporphyrinogen isomers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
