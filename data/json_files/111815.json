They discovered the different movements and positions of the larynx and vocal cords in various vocal registers, such as chest, falsetto, and head voice. The study also explains the mechanism of voice production through the compression and expansion of air and the role of the glottis in creating sound.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
