They found that the 10mm hydrogen flame in the Ashworth safety-lamp could detect a quantity of benzoline vapour that was one thirty-sixth of the explosive proportion and one twentieth of the inflammable proportion. The benzoline flame also showed a distinct \"cap\" when the amount of benzoline vapour was one-ninth of the explosive mixture and one-fifth of the inflammable mixture. Further experiments with alcohol and ether vapours are being conducted.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Safety and Analysis"}
