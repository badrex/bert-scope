The method involves using complex variables and stress combinations, which are related to orthogonal curvilinear coordinates, to transform and simplify the equations for stresses and displacements. The complex potentials are shown to be useful in finding appropriate solutions for various problems in elasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
