They describe the rods as being similar to piano hammers and explain their varying lengths and shapes. The cochlea, they argue, works like a musical instrument, with the rods representing the strings of a harp or the teeth of a musical box. The rods vibrate when sounds or vibrations pass through the cochlea, causing nerve-cells to send nerve-currents to the brain for interpretation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
