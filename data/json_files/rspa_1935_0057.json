They built a small sealed-off expansion chamber filled with heavy hydrogen and bombarded it with ions to study the emitted particles. The results showed evidence of a group of tracks with the expected range, providing insights into the transmutation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
