It provides explicit expressions for the amplitudes of sound modes associated with the discrete wavenumber spectrum generated upstream and downstream of a specified source distribution. The study also introduces a new approach to non-classical eigenvalue problems, combining elements of residue theory and Sturm-Liouville theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
