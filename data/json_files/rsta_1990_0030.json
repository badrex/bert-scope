The author assesses the accuracy and limitations of these methods and interprets the periodicities found. The main conclusion is that solar variability has appeared in the form of recurrent expulsions of magnetic activity at the Sun's surface, accompanied by a modulation of its rotation and periodic changes in its radius. The author suggests a connection between solar variability and the Earth's meteorology, which could be of great importance if proven.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
