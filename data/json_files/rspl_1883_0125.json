The author demonstrates that light draught can be as unfavorable to stability as low freeboard and proposes a new method for analyzing ship stability, called cross curves of stability, which take into account the changes in displacement and righting moments at different draughts.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
