The calorimeter eliminates several sources of error found in water calorimeters, and the authors found that the heat of combustion of succinic acid agrees well with previous high-precision measurements. The aneroid calorimeter offers a more accurate and precise method for measuring heats of combustion, making it a suitable tool for chemical applications and research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Calorimetry"}
