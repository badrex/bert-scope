The theory relates the charge collected by the probe to the ion density in the plasma and is applicable to various plasmas with similar physical criteria. The authors derive a set of time-dependent partial differential equations, linearize them, and solve them using the Laplace transformation method, providing a solution in the form of a generalized Fourier series. Approximations are made to calculate the free stream ion density from the collected electric charge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
