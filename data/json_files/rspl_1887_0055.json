It demonstrates that these processes can be understood and solved using dynamic principles rather than just the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The paper also investigates the effects of pressure on the melting point of solids, solubility of salts, and capillarity on solubility.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Thermodynamics"}
