They find that resonance between different molecular structures leads to a perfectly symmetrical structure, and they calculate the lengths and energies of the links in these molecules. Their findings help to understand the behavior of these radicals and their resonance energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
