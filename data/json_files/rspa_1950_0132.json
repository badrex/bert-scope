They found that surface flow, a type of diffusion along a concentration gradient, enhances the rate of flow and can be affected by variables such as specific surface area, adsorption isotherm, porosity, and temperature. The authors developed a general equation for flow in micropores and analyzed the variables to determine the conditions under which surface flow and gas flow occur independently and in parallel.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
