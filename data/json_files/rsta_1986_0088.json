It focuses on the central role of mathematical modeling in predicting how radionuclide concentrations change over time near underground waste repositories. The article also examines the validity of proposed models and outlines current and future work aimed at improving our understanding of radionuclide migration in groundwater.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
