The authors discuss early experiments, defects in the patterns, and techniques to improve resolution and uniformity. The results provide insights into the atomic patterns within crystal structures and have implications for understanding interatomic forces and diffraction phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
