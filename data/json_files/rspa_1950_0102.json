This theory is applied to electron cascades, allowing for the calculation of the mean number of particles in any energy interval and the mean square deviation of this number. The author also critiques the common method of treating continuous parametric systems by dividing the domain of the parameter into small segments, showing that it does not lead to a continuous parametric assembly of the type described in this paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
