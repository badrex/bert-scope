The author presents a method of successive approximation to solve the equations with diffusion, providing a solution for the speed of a flame maintained by a single reaction. The study focuses on a single exothermic chemical reaction and considers the diffusion of the main reactants and products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
