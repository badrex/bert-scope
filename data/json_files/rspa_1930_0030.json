They observe the periodic times of oscillation in torsion and bending of wires with various orientations to determine the Torsional Modulus of Rigidity and the Longitudinal Young's Modulus. The results show that tungsten crystals exhibit very nearly isotropic elastic properties, with small variations in orientation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
