He found that common air does not generate fixed air during phlogistication, and the diminution is not due to the generation or separation of fixed air. Cavendish also investigated the conversion of nitrous and vitriolic acids into dephlogisticated air and the solubility of selenite in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Laws"}
