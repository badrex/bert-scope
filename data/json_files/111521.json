Brodie, discovered a new class of peroxides of organic radicals, including peroxides of benzoyl and acetyl. These peroxides are prepared by reacting anhydrous acids or their corresponding chlorides with peroxide of barium. The author describes the properties and analysis of these peroxides, and suggests further research directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
