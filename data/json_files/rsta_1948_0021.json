The copper spectrum is unique for having more identified levels above the point of easiest ionization than below, indicating that auto-ionization is common. The study also discusses the use of a globule arc as a source for obtaining a cleaner spectrum, free of spark lines and with fewer molecular lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
