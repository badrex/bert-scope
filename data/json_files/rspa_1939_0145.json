They observed hyperfine structure doublets in the absorption spectrum of Li7 and found that the Zeeman components of the stronger resonance line agreed with the nuclear spin value. This study provided insights into the atomic and nuclear properties of lithium, contributing to the understanding of alkali metals' atomic structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
