The research shows that bacteroids can efficiently fix nitrogen without external energy sources while respiring. The authors propose that succinate and malate increase endogenous reserves that serve as the primary source of reducing power for fixation. The study also reveals the presence of at least two terminal oxidase systems in bacteroids, which respond differently to exogenous substrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
