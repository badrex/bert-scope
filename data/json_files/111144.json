He observed that the diffusion rates varied depending on the type of salt and the concentration of the solution. The results showed that the hydrates of potash and soda had the highest and lowest diffusibility, respectively, while the diffusion rates of other salts were generally similar. The double tartrate of potash and soda was found to undergo decomposition during the diffusion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solutions and Diffusion"}
