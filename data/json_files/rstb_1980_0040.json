This method offers improved efficiency and feasibility for industrial production. The synthesis involves converting penicillin ester-oxides into -oxazoline-azetidinone, followed by further modifications to create the desired 1-oxacephem nucleus. This research contributes to the development of new antibiotics with enhanced or unique antibacterial activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
