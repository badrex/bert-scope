The diatoms are grouped into four classes based on their geographical distribution and ecological preferences. The analysis suggests that the temperature at the time of deposit formation was similar to present-day England, and the pool in which the deposit formed was a moderately eutrophic one with a chloride content of 15 to 25 mg.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
