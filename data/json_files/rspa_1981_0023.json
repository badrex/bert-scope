The effective outgassing temperature can be used to estimate the distribution of actual outgassing temperatures following parent body collisions, providing insights into the mechanisms that transfer debris from the asteroid belt to Earth. The study finds that the mean temperature rise during at least one fragmentation event is around 200\u00b0C, corresponding to a mean energy dissipation of more than 10^20 J.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteoritics and Planetary Science"}
