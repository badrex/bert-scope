They discovered that the gland's structure, including the membrana propria, protects capillaries from the maximum secretory pressure within the gland. This mechanism is essential for maintaining proper circulation and preventing damage to the gland's cells and capillaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
