The experiments aimed to understand the relationship between a substance's ability to absorb moisture and its conducting power with respect to heat. The results showed that linen absorbed more moisture than other materials, but it did not necessarily mean that it was the best insulator. The author also discusses the potential health benefits of wearing flannel clothing.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
