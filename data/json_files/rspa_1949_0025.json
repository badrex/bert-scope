The authors compare theoretical calculations with experimental data to understand the processes occurring in aurorae and nocturnal sky radiations. They find that direct solar radiation on nitrogen ions is responsible for sunlit aurorae and twilight sky emission, while a high degree of nitrogen dissociation is required for the strong infrared emission from the nocturnal sky.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
