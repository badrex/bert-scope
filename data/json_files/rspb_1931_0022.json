They found that the enzyme's activity is more rapid on the acidic side and that the optimal pH and temperature depend on the duration of the experiment. The study emphasizes the importance of considering the actual conditions found in living animals when investigating enzyme activity and digestion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
