The study explores the effects of changes in the composition and concentration of electrolytes in the surrounding medium on the potential difference. The findings reveal that the potential difference is a function of the state of the egg surface and the ionic difference in concentration between the interior of the cell and the external fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
