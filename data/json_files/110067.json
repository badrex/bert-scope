He concludes that the apparent direction of the eyes depends on the balance of the general position of the face and the turn of the eyes from that position. This understanding can explain why eyes in a portrait appear to follow the viewer in different directions.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Art and Perception"}
