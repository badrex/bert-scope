They argue for the importance of uniformity in methods and the need for independent verification of results. The author also demonstrates that certain coefficients in the development of the disturbing function equal zero, which has implications for the accuracy of lunar tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
