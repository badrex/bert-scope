ESR dating has been applied to various sites in Israel and Africa, providing evidence of the existence of anatomically modern humans more than 100,000 years ago. The technique has proven to be a valuable tool in understanding the biological and cultural evolution of modern humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Evolution"}
