They found that exposure to these inhibitors led to an increase in the quantum content of the end-plate potential, followed by conduction block in intramuscular motor nerve branches. These changes resulted from the inhibition of a sodium pump in the motor nerve axons and their endings, affecting the release of neurotransmitter and the overall transmission process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
