The researchers mapped the Late Devensian glacial deposits and analyzed the distribution of associated deposits of non-glacial origin. They also investigated the occurrence of faunas and floras at various levels within the Devensian deposits and the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of periglacial phenomena to understand the palaeo-environment of the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
