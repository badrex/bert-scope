The authors analyze the event and the effects of lightning on conductors, questioning the effectiveness of pointed conductors in preventing damage. They recommend a new method for preventing future lightning damage to buildings, involving a continuous metallic channel around the building's parapet. The authors also express their concerns about the use of pointed conductors and the potential risks they pose.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
