They found that lysosomes break down ingested macromolecules, such as albumin, into smaller components like free amino acids or dipeptides. This process helps protect cells from a massive penetration of foreign macromolecules while allowing some to enter the cell and reach their intended destinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
