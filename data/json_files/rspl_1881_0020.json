They confirmed that the hydrogen-magnesium series of lines is due to a combination of hydrogen with magnesium and not solely dependent on temperature. The study also revealed the effects of different environments on the magnesium spectrum, such as burning magnesium in oxygen, and the influence of other elements like iron and chlorine on the spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
