They used negative ions to measure the drift velocity under the influence of weak electric fields, and their findings agree with theoretical predictions based on Landau's excitation model of helium. The results provide valuable information about the dispersion curve of elementary excitations in liquid helium and contribute to the understanding of superfluidity."}
