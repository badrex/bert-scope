The movement of uranium is related to processes of magmatism and metamorphism during this geological event. The province is situated along the southern margin of an early Proterozoic continent and may have been underlain by older basement and a subduction zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
