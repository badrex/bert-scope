They show that the network is still a valid representation, but the phase lengths of the arms are altered, and a low dislocation density can produce almost complete randomization of the electron orbits. The author presents an alternative method for calculating the electrical conductivity of a random-phase network and applies it to cases where randomness affects only some of the phases, as is believed to be the situation in real metals like zinc and magnesium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
