It focuses on the restrictions that local symmetry requirements impose on model clusters and how these restrictions can be used to characterize bulk and surface properties. The author applies the theory to iridium and compares calculated and measured dialectric functions related to the reflectivity of the metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
