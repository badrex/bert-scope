Two distinct wave types are identified, one characterized by a long dissipation length scale and the other with comparable dissipation and wavelengths. The study provides insights into the dynamic behavior of fluid-filled porous media and has implications for geophysics, acoustics, and oceanography.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
