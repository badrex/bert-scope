The first method combines glint observations with on-board solar aspect angle measurements, while the second method uses two glint observations. Both methods provide multiple possible solutions, but the correct spin-axis direction can be selected based on the context and available data.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Space Science"}
