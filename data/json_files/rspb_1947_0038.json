They found that the fungus grows well on certain media, and the production of glutinosin is influenced by the form of nitrogen and organic acids in the culture medium. Glutinosin is toxic to various fungi but is less toxic to bacteria. The authors also investigated methods for extracting and purifying glutinosin from culture filtrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fungal Biology"}
