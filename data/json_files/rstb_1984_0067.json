The study found that an integrated ecosystem perspective is crucial for understanding and assessing the vulnerability of surface waters to acidification. Important factors affecting surface water acidity include soil depth, soil mineralogy, and forest development stage. The ILWAS model simulates the biogeochemical processes controlling lake-watershed acidity, providing a theoretical framework for characterizing the effects of acid deposition on surface waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecosystems and Biogeochemistry"}
