They measured the density of heavy water with accurately known isotopic composition and provided accurate thermodynamic properties for use in nuclear reactors and power generation. The study extended previous work on ordinary water and used similar experimental techniques and apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
