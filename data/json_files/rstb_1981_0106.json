Both disorders have deficiencies in different membrane glycoproteins, suggesting specific roles for these proteins in platelet function. The article highlights the importance of membrane glycoproteins in platelet surface contact interactions and their impact on platelet aggregation and clot retraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
