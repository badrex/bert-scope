They found that optimal stimulation patterns for fast muscles consisted of an initial high-frequency portion followed by a train of impulses at a lower frequency. However, for muscles that had been stimulated chronically at a constant low frequency, an initial high-frequency portion conferred no advantage. These findings have potential for clinical use in applications such as cardiac assistance and limb muscle restoration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
