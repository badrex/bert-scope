Diatom analysis provides evidence of acidification and can help assess the timing and rate of change. The method has several advantages, including its potential usefulness at all sites, continuous records, and the ability to extend the record backwards in time. The article also discusses the techniques used for sediment coring, dating, and diatom preparation, as well as the advantages and limitations of diatom analysis for indicating acidification history.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
