The author, David Brewster, presents a simple law stating that the index of refraction is equal to the tangent of the angle of polarization. The study covers various transparent materials and their polarizing angles, providing a foundation for understanding the behavior of light in different media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
