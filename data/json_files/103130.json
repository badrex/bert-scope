This phenomenon, called penetration, is also responsible for heat, fire, and other natural occurrences. The experiment showed that the liquids' dimensions decreased over time, even after the initial ebullition and evaporation. This discovery has implications for understanding the behavior of substances in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
