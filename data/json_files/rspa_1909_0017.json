The research shows that the fatigue process remains similar for both light sources, with the photoelectric activity decaying as the sum of two exponential terms. The study also highlights the importance of the intensity and character of the illumination in affecting the rate of surface alteration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
