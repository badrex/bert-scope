They found that a deficiency in magnesium, iron, or phosphorus reduced the plants' photosynthetic activity, both when light and temperature were limiting factors. This study highlights the importance of nutrient salts in maintaining optimal photosynthetic activity and plant growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
