They found that applying an electrostatic field inhibited fungal growth, with the extent of inhibition depending on the field's strength and duration. The results suggest that surface charges induced by the field may cause changes in viscosity, affecting hyphal growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
