The MHC is a chromosomal region that plays a significant role in immune responses, disease susceptibility, and other biological traits. The author compares MHC gene products in rhesus monkeys, chimpanzees, and humans, and discusses the implications of similarities and differences in terms of evolution. The presence of a functional MHC is observed in various vertebrate species, suggesting convergent evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
