The research discovers that the sting is caused by substances similar to acetylcholine and histamine, as well as a disturbance in calcium metabolism. The study also finds that the sting's potency is due to a yet-unknown substance, possibly from the guanidine group of compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
