They discover that certain substances, produced by bacterial action in bacterised peat, stimulate plant growth. These substances are soluble in water and alcohol, and their presence is essential for normal plant growth. The author also finds that these substances are not present in raw peat or produced by chemical means, but are created through bacterial action.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
