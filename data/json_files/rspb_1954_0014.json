They describe a method to isolate plant mitochondria and explore their role in cellular respiration, specifically the Krebs cycle. The author presents evidence that plant mitochondria contain enzymes necessary for the Krebs cycle reactions and can carry out the single-step reactions of the cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
