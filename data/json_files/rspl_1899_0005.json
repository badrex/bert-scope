The authors found that choline and neurine cause a fall in arterial blood pressure due to their action on the heart and dilation of peripheral vessels. They also discovered that choline and neurine have different toxic actions and effects on the body. The study provides insights into the potential role of choline and neurine in diseases like General Paralysis of the Insane.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
