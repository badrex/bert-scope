The researchers found that these flagella, which resemble fish lateral lines, are flexible laterally and rigid longitudinally. They also discovered that the distal parts of the flagella behave mechanically independently of the animal's body, allowing for more accurate detection of sources of vibration. This finding suggests that these crustaceans have two lateral lines that are spaced apart and independent of the body, leading to more dramatic changes in the patterns of excitation of the mechanoreceptors with changes in the position of an external source of vibration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
