The neo-series compounds are formed through epimerization at specific carbon centers in the corrinoid system. The author reviews the chemical properties and equilibration of the neo-series, providing insights into the stereochemistry and biosynthesis of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
