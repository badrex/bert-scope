They discovered that the speed necessary for the disappearance of flicker increases with the increase of light intensity, and the exact relative \"last\" for different colors was determined. The research also showed that brighter illumination produces a greater stimulus, and the impression produced retains its maximum for a shorter time.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
