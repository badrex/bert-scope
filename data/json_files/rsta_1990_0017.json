The research identifies five morphostratigraphic units of estuarine alluvium and reveals the influence of human forces on the area's coastal change and development since Roman times. The findings contribute to understanding the complex interplay of natural and human factors in shaping the estuarine environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Geomorphology"}
