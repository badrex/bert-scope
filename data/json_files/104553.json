Simpson presents a method for determining fluents of multivariable polynomials and series affected by radical signs, which do not begin to converge until after the second term. This method has applications in solving problems in various fields, including nature and physics. Simpson provides examples of how this method can be used to solve problems related to oscillation and orbits.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus"}
