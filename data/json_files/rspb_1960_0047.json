They explore the relationship between continuous, quantized, and modal variation and suggest that processes of simple quantization can account for modal numbers up to about 5 to 7. Larger modal numbers require more accurate regulation of continuous variables, which may be achieved through multiplicative processes or chemical counting processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
