It separates space and spin variables to utilize the symmetry properties under rotations in spin space and applies the theory of irreducible tensor operators to establish the basic results. The study focuses on spin-dependent operators and their effects on density matrices, providing a powerful tool for discussing the behavior of many-electron systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
