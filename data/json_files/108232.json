They discovered that the germinal vesicle is the essential element of the ovum and that new cells originate from the pellucid fluid within the central cavity. This research also revealed the importance of the nucleolus, nucleus, and cell in the structure of organized beings and provided insights into the process of cell formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
