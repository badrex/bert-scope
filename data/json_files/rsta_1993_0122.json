It discusses the bond energy and its biological significance, as well as the contribution to protein stability. The author presents various examples, including the interaction between histidine and phenylalanine in a-helices, and the binding of phosphocholine to the mouse immunoglobulin McPC603.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Biology"}
