They calculate core ionization potentials of simple molecules using ab initio molecular wavefunctions and consider orbital relaxation effects. The study provides a better understanding of core binding energies and the origin of satellite peaks in high-energy photoelectron spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
