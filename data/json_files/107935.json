They discuss the methods for calculating these disturbances and provide analytical expressions for the development of R, which is crucial for understanding these inequalities. The author also introduces a new system of indices for arguments in planetary disturbances and discusses the differences between this and the Lunar Theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
