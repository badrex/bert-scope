He discovers that the friction between surfaces depends on the quantity and distribution of the lubricant, and that the resistance varies with the velocity and pressure. Reynolds also determines the viscosity of olive oil at different temperatures and develops an empirical formula for it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
