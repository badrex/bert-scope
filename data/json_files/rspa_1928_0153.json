The author reviews the research on auroral displays, their heights, and the auroral spectrum. The study focuses on the spectrum of the polar aurora, which is found to have similarities with the band spectrum of nitrogen. The author also examines the different band systems and their excitation potentials, providing a comprehensive understanding of the aurora and its spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
