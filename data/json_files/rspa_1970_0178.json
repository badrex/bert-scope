They found that the quantum yield for photolysis increases with decreasing wavelength and is affected by the presence of water vapor or hydrogen. The results suggest that singlet molecular oxygen is produced in the primary step at all wavelengths in the ultraviolet region, and the atomic product's state varies with the wavelength. This study has implications for atmospheric photochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
