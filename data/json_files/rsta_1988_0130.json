They discuss the relationships between major rock units, the significance of geological structures, and the remaining problems that geological mapping might help to solve. The study combines observations from the Geotraverse, previous mapping, and interpretation of orbital images, providing a comprehensive overview of the region's geology.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
