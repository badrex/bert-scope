They support this by analyzing the size distribution, examining the spherules with scanning electron microscopy, and comparing them to grindwheel sparks. The authors estimate the influx of cosmic spherules at about 14 tonnes per day, making it unlikely that meteorites or comets could account for the majority of these particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
