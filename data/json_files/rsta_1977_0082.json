Shock experiments show that the intensity of shock remanence increases with pressure, and shock demagnetization preferentially demagnetizes the softer part of thermo-remanent magnetization. The results suggest that shock remanence is likely to be the cause of the natural remanent magnetization of certain regolith breccias and that shock may modify the primary remanence of other samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
