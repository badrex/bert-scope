They simplify the properties of tungsten, assuming that resistivity and emissivity vary directly with temperature, while thermal conductivity remains constant. This allows for a complete solution of the main differential equation governing temperature distribution. The theory is mainly applicable to two types of vacuum lamps used in optical pyrometry, providing a method for estimating their main characteristics and suggesting modifications in their design."}
