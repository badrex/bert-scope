The authors heated benzalazine in sealed evacuated bulbs and analyzed the composition of the resulting permanent gas using gas-analysis over mercury. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanism and the decomposition process of benzalazine vapor.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
