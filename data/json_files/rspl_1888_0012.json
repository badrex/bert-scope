The author, H.G. Seeley, investigates the shoulder girdle and fore-limb bones, comparing them to other reptiles and monotreme mammals. The findings contribute to understanding the evolution and relationships between different reptile groups and early mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleobiology"}
