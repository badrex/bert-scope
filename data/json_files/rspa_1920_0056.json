C. McLennan and A. C. Lewis, conducted experiments to study the spectra of various elements in helium in the extreme ultra-violet region. They used a fluorite spectrograph and helium gas to obtain the spectra of elements such as silicon, tellurium, molybdenum, and zirconium. The study provides a better understanding of the properties and behavior of these elements in the extreme ultra-violet region.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
