They found that dopamine depolarizes cone L-type horizontal cells and reduces the amplitude of light-evoked responses. The results suggest that dopamine may mimic the effects of interplexiform cell activity, which could regulate lateral inhibitory effects and center-surround antagonism in the retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
