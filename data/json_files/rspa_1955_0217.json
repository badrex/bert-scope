They found that both inhibitors reduced the reaction rate to the same limit, indicating that the residual reaction is almost entirely heterogeneous and the gas-phase reaction is suppressed. The results provide insights into the use of nitric oxide and olefines for inhibiting chain reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
