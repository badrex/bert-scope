The swimbladder helps control buoyancy, while the accessory funnels, or jets, enable the octopus to swim and maneuver in various directions. This adaptation allows the octopus to live a nektonic life in open waters, where it is preyed upon by top predators like swordfish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cephalopod Biology"}
