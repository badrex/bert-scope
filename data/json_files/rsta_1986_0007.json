It discusses the concept of supply, focusing on the rate at which water is extracted by a root system, and the demand for water, which is defined in terms of a maximum crop growth rate. The author presents a model to estimate the rate of water extraction and suggests a new approach to defining \"demand\" based on a potential rate of growth, which can help improve irrigation calculations and timing.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology"}
