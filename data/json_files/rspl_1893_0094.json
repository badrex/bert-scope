They found that bacteria were not affected by the infra-red, red, orange, or yellow regions of the spectrum, but were destroyed in the blue and violet regions. The study suggests that naked arc light could be an efficient disinfecting agent in various settings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
