He discovers that when two polarized pencils are reflected from the surface of a thin plate, half an undulation is not lost, resulting in the formation of white-centered rings. This study contributes to the understanding of interference and the behavior of light in different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
