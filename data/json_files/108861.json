They argue that the foundation of generic descriptions should be based on the skeleton's characteristics, as it is the most enduring and regular part of the animal. The author also discusses the importance of auxiliary characters, such as incurrent and excurrent canals, intermarginal cavities, and reproductive modes, in distinguishing between genera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
