The author presents a method to calculate the sound scattered by the connecting plate, considering its interaction with the fluid between the plates. The study provides insights into the behavior of parallel elastic plates and their connections, which are relevant in marine applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Acoustics and Vibration"}
