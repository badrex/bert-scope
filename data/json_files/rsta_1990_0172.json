This method combines proton imaging with nuclear electron double resonance and can track the progress of nitroxide free radicals injected into the bloodstream. The technique has potential applications in biology and medicine, such as studying disease states and pharmacokinetic studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Medical and Health Sciences"}
