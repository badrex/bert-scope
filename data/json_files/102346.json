They discovered that the child had a spinal cord and some brain-like tissue, which they studied to understand the child's movements and other functions. The case study provides insights into the importance of the brain and the role of the spinal cord in the functioning of the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
