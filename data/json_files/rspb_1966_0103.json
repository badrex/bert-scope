This substance was found to preserve the motility of cock sperm for several hours in vitro at the bird's body temperature. The molecular weight of the poly-\u03b1-L-glutamic acid was determined to be 73,600 by specific viscosity and 81,600 by end group analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproduction and Development"}
