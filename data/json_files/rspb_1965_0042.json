The sensory cilia act as receptors for water displacement and detect nearby vibrations. The fingers of Leucothea, which are independent effector organs, respond to these vibrations by extending or retracting. The study provides insights into the organization of the nerve net and the specificity of connections between sensory organs and muscle fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Sensory Systems"}
