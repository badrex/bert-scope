They found that metals with lower melting points have a greater variation in rigidity with temperature. The author also discovered that metals have internal viscosity, which affects the measurements. The results show that the more fusible a metal, the greater the change in rigidity with temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
