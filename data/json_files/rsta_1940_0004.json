The author develops a mathematical model to analyze the tides and provides a method for solving the differential equations involved. The study focuses on the relationship between the ocean's width, depth, and tidal behavior, offering insights into the complex dynamics of ocean tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
