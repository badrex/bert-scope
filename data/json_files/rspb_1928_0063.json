They found that during normal gland activity, cells secrete hormones into the alveolar lumen, which then pass into the bloodstream. In cases of exophthalmic goitre, the gland's structure is altered, and cells may secrete hormones directly into the blood capillaries. This research provides insight into the functioning of the thyroid gland and its role in endocrine system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrine System"}
