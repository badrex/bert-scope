The authors explore the predictability of destructive earthquakes using the stick-slip model and its modifications, focusing on the two-dimensional and one-dimensional versions of the model. They also introduce a hypothesis for aftershock occurrences based on the entropy relaxation and partial melting of the crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
