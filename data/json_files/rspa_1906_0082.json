They found that the rate of diffusion followed Stefan's law and provided evidence of ionic migration in the natural diffusion of acids and salts. This research extended the Nernst-Planck theory and had implications for understanding the behavior of electrolytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
