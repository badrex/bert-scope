The model considers the opening of the cracks by continuous distributions of long straight edge dislocations and determines the criterion for the cracks to join up, causing complete fracture of the solid. The results are applied to a brief discussion of experimental results on the deformation of magnesium oxide single crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
