The authors demonstrate that microjets can be formed during the rapid compression of gas bubbles in liquid explosives, which can aid in the initiation of explosions by increasing the impact velocity and dispersing the liquid into fine particles. The experiments also show how cavities can be formed ahead of the burning zone and their role in transforming burning into a more violent explosion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
