The author demonstrates that the process mainly consists of the penetration of colorless corpuscles (migratory cells) that undergo active cell division. The findings provide evidence that the difference between a normal and inflamed cornea can be recognized by the presence of these migratory cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
