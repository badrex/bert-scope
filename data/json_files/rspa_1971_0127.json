This method provides simple and accurate solutions to problems in nonlinear heat conduction, boundary-layer heat transfer, and other fields, which were previously tackled by numerical methods. The technique is demonstrated through the solution of several example equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
