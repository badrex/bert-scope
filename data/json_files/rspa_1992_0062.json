It introduces transformation influence functions and transformation concentration factor tensors to estimate the residual local fields caused by transformation fields. The self-consistent and Mori-Tanaka methods are used to evaluate specific estimates of these tensors, and the overall stiffness of multiphase media is discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
