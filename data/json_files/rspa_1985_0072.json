The model uses mathematical expressions for the material properties of plain concrete and stress-strain relations of steel reinforcement to develop equations for both strength and deformational behavior. The theoretical results are shown to be in good agreement with experimental data from earlier investigations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Civil Engineering"}
