They discovered that protons with energies above 150,000 volts could cause elements to emit alpha particles, a process that was the reverse of beta particle transformation. The researchers found that lithium, boron, and fluorine produced the largest emission of particles, suggesting that the addition of a captured proton formed a new alpha particle inside the nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
