The authors discovered that the shape of the bands depends on the nature of any previous strain the crystal has experienced. They also found that under pure tension, glide occurs on irregularly shaped surfaces, and that compression can produce similar glide surfaces. The study provides insights into the behavior of materials under stress and the role of dislocations in their deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
