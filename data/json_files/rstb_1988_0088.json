It shows how the tiered principal retina, unique among spiders and arthropods, develops from a simple hemispherical arrangement of primordial receptive segments. The findings provide insights into the evolution of the Salticidae family and the unique visual capabilities of jumping spiders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
