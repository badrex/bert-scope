They used infra-red spectroscopy to analyze the absorption bands of the peptide-NH-CO group and found that the spectra of crystalline derivatives of gramicidin S showed considerable dichroism, similar to folded synthetic polypeptides and a-keratin. A model of the polypeptide chain configuration was proposed, which satisfied the infra-red data and represented a stable configuration for the chain.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
