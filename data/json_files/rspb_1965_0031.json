The time-variation of the pressure gradient in the aorta is deduced, and the regurgitation is calculated as a percentage of total cardiac output. The method, which models the aorta as a rigid tube, may be suitable for routine diagnostic purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
