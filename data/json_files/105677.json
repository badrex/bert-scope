Mr. Nevil Maskelyne, M. De la Lande discusses the importance of accurate astronomical observations for determining longitude at sea. He mentions the use of sector and plumb-line instruments, as well as the need for better understanding the differences in meridians between various locations. He also shares his observations of the occultations of stars and planets, which can help in determining the difference in longitude between London and Paris.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Navigation"}
