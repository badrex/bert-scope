He explains how the scattering of alpha particles through large angles provides evidence for the intense electric forces within the atom and helps deduce the properties of the atomic nucleus. Rutherford also suggests that the mass of the hydrogen nucleus may be electrical in origin, calling it the positive electron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
