The author, Edward Matthews, investigated the event and found that the sinkhole was caused by the collapse of a limestone bed due to the rapid flow of water through the area. This caused the river to divert its course and created new springs in the surrounding area. The sinkhole and its geological implications were studied and documented, providing valuable insights into the natural processes shaping the landscape.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
