They analyzed artificial luminous cloud observations to investigate the formation of mid-latitude E\\lt;sub\\gt;s\\lt;/sub\\gt; layers based on wind shear. The results showed that the wind-shear theory is valid for the formation of E\\lt;sub\\gt;s\\lt;/sub\\gt; layers, but more detailed analysis is needed for heights greater than 110 to 120 km.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
