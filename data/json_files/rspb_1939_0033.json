They conducted experiments using the Levin-Wyman ergometer to measure work and found that the efficiency is influenced by the speed of shortening and the load. The highest efficiency occurs at an optimum speed and load, and the results can be compared to human muscle efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
