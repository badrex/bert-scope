The olfactory epithelium of these fish only responds to the steroid after stimulation with the urine of ovulated female Atlantic salmon. This discovery suggests a possible role for the steroid in the physiology of Atlantic salmon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
