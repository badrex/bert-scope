They found evidence of flexibility in long hydrocarbon chains, which supports the theory of stereochemistry requiring free rotation in carbon-to-carbon linkages. The research also provides insights into the formation of rings in organic compounds and the orientation of molecules in surface films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
