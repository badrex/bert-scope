The Lagrangian is a function of the co-ordinates, velocity, acceleration, and angular velocity of the particle, considering the apparent angular velocity minus the'relativity precession'. The study is conducted in general Riemannian co-ordinates, and the equations refer to the center of mass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity"}
