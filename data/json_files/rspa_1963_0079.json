They found that the AlAu bond is stronger than expected, and estimated the dissociation energy in the ground state to be 64 mole. This research contributes to understanding the stability and properties of diatomic molecules containing gold and other elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
