The author, M. Messier, noticed that during the phenomenon, compass needles lost their usual direction and electrical machines gained an uncommon degree of force. The article also mentions that the Aurora Borealis was observed in other locations like Berlin and Vienna, where similar effects were noticed on compass needles and electrical machines.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Atmospheric Phenomena"}
