It explains how the inhibitor, also known as Mullerian-inhibiting substance (MIS) or anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH), is responsible for causing the regression of the Mullerian duct system during male foetal development. The author also describes the consequences of ectopic MIS exposure during female embryogenesis, leading to the elimination of the Mullerian duct system and the degeneration of the ovaries. The article highlights the importance of understanding the MIS signaling pathway for Mullerian duct regression and gonadal function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Development"}
