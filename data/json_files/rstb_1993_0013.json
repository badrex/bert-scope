The authors explore the mechanisms behind genomic imprinting, including the role of DNA methylation in controlling gene expression and the impact of parental origin on gene expression patterns. They also examine the relationship between parental imprints, germline-dependent epigenetic inheritance, and totipotency using embryonic stem cells derived from the epiblast.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
