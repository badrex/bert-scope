They used the reaction between carbon monoxide and chlorine as a model system and found that light can accelerate the reaction. The authors developed a method to control the intensity and purity of the light source to obtain reliable results. Their work provides insights into the fundamental understanding of light-induced chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
