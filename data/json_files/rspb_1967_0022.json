They explore the equilibrium constant and its implications for understanding chemical interactions and migration patterns in these systems. The study provides insights into the interpretation of future migration experiments and the theoretical understanding of these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry"}
