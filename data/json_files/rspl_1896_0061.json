These reflexes provide insight into the scope of reflex inhibition and coordination, and the author also discovered that the animal's respiration remains unaffected during these reflexes. The term \"cataleptoid\" is used because these reflexes share some similarities with hypnotic catalepsy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
