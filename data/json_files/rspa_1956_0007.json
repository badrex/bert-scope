The authors construct flow fields using stream functions of a ring source on the pipe wall or a point source on the pipe axis. They discuss the physical behavior of the fluid and the importance of the parameter ratio in determining the flow patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
