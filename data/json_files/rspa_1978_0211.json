The authors demonstrate that mean times for the response of a chromatographic column are independent of mass transfer processes and can be determined from measurements of the response. This approach extends the model-independent treatment to multicomponent chromatography, providing a more complex but versatile method for determining phase-equilibrium properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
