They found that the negative leak from calcium was much larger than from platinum, and the negative leak from lime was smaller than from calcium. The authors also discovered a curious increase in the negative leak when the cathode was left in a vacuum for some time, which was connected to the appearance of a dark substance on the surface of the platinum strip.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrical Discharge Physics"}
