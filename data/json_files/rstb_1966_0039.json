The author investigates how these displays develop ontogenetically and whether external conditions play a role in their development. The study finds that social behavior develops in a regular and predictable sequence, starting at a simple level and becoming more complex. Courtship displays are mainly due to conflicts between aggression and escape tendencies, and the development of these tendencies depends on social experience.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ethology"}
