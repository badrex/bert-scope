This phenomenon is explained by the theory of 'forced' dipole radiation, a type of Stark effect due to interionic fields in the arc. The author also found three other odd levels with similar properties, and discusses the implications of these findings for understanding complex spectra and the potential for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
