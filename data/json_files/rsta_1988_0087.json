They describe the complex Tertiary P-T paths for the Greater Himalayan metamorphic sequence in the central Himalaya, which provide insights into the relations between tectonic and thermal processes during orogenesis. The model involves several stages of burial, uplift, and cooling, as well as the formation of leucogranite plutons.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Tectonics and Structural Geology"}
