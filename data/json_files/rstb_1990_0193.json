It shows that both density-dependent and density-independent heterogeneity can contribute to population regulation, and that the greater the density independence, the more stable the populations are likely to be. The study provides a framework for understanding the consequences of heterogeneity on population dynamics and offers a rule for predicting the effects of different kinds of heterogeneity on population regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
