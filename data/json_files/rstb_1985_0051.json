The results show that low-intensity stimulation can inhibit the responses evoked by noxious heat, while high-intensity, low-frequency stimulation produces fewer clear inhibitions. The findings suggest that a wide range of primary afferents may be involved in pain relief through transcutaneous nerve stimulation and acupuncture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
