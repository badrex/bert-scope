They derive a form of the theory that is useful for numerical calculations of the spatial variation of the order parameter. The equation is valid over a wider range of values of temperature and order parameter, and it can be numerically integrated directly. The authors also discuss boundary conditions at the interface between two metals and the relationship between their quasi-local equation and the Ginzburg-Landau equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
