They observed various symptoms, such as unsteadiness, tremors, and oscillations, and analyzed the secondary effects using histological investigations. The research provides insights into the understanding of cerebellum-related disorders in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
