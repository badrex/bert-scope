The authors explore the monopole singularity of the phase 2-form near degeneracies in two families of Hamiltonians: the quartic-momentum square well and the Aharonov-Bohm billiards. They also investigate the phase dislocations in wavefronts and their behavior near degeneracies. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the geometric phase and its applications in quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum mechanics"}
