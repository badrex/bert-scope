The authors find that mixed nitrate melts containing divalent cations exhibit anomalies in the prefreezing region, but these anomalies do not prevent normal crystallization. The study provides insights into the structure and behavior of nitrate melts, contributing to the understanding of their unique properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
