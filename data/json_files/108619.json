It discusses the concept of secondary caustics and their connection to the primary caustic, as well as the impact of different incident ray configurations on the formation of caustics. The author also provides insights into the theory of combined reflexions and refractions of a pencil of rays transmitted through a plate or prism.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
