They propose that the bones of different animals, particularly carnivorous ones, have been brought together by natural processes such as the movement of the earth's crust and the deposition of animal remains. The author also considers the possibility of climate and habitat changes affecting the distribution of animal fossils.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
