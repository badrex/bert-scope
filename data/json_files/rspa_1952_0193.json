The author presents formulas to predict the viscosity of monomolecular liquids near their melting point and the variation of viscosity with temperature. The author also investigates the effect of an electric field on the viscosity of liquids, finding that the large increases in viscosity reported with polar liquids under steady fields are spurious and due to ion accumulation near the electrodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
