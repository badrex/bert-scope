The authors describe the process of cloning the IFN-\u03b1 cDNA and the identification of different IFN-\u03b1 cDNAs with distinct target cell specificities. They also explore the classification of IFN-\u03b1 genes into two major subfamilies and their relationship with other genes in higher organisms. The study provides insights into the development of interferons in E. coli and the expression of the chromosomal gene for HuIFN-\u03b1 in mouse L cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
