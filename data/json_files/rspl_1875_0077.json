They discovered that the movement of the vanes is influenced by both the radiation from candles and the presence of a magnet. The author also discussed the internal friction within the radiometer and its impact on the movement. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between light and motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Radiometry"}
