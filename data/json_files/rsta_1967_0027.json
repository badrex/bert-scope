Three groups in the United Kingdom, using different Royal Air Establishment kinetheodolites, made modifications to enhance their tracking capabilities. These improvements included control units for adjusting repetition rates, larger sighting telescopes for better light-grasp, and photoelectric recording methods. The advancements allowed for more accurate tracking and recording of artificial satellites.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Satellite Technology"}
