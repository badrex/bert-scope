The author analyzes data from the London Weekly Bills of Mortality to determine the main periods of the disease's outbreaks. The findings reveal that measles has a seasonal prevalence and a disease with short intervals between epidemics, making it an ideal candidate for this type of analysis. The study provides valuable insights into the understanding of measles epidemics and their periodicity, which can help in developing strategies to control and prevent future outbreaks.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Epidemiology"}
