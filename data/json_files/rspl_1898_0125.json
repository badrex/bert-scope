These lightweight mirrors offer good definition and can be useful in applications where lightness and clarity are important, such as in photographic recording instruments. The process involves creating a film from the solutions, stretching it over a ring, and then silvering the film for reflection.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics"}
