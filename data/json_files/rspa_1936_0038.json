They discovered that the fluorescence beam can be partially polarized and is not due to normal atomic resonance radiation. The phenomenon can be explained by the presence of very loosely bound Hg2-molecules, or van der Waals molecules, which have frequencies close to those of single atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
