They found that the gases collected in 1970 and 1971 can be distinguished by their sulfur content. The study helps to understand the role of the volatile phase in volcanic processes and provides a reference point for future research on volcanic gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
