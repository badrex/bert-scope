They find that the specific heat in the two-phase region depends on the thermal history and proportions of the two phases present. The heat of transformation from hexagonal close-packed to body-centered cubic sodium is deduced to be about 10 cal/g atom. The Debye temperatures of the two phases are determined to be 160 and 153 K, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
