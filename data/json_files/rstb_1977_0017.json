The results showed that meiotic chromosomes transferred to a mitotic spindle behaved as they normally would, suggesting that intrinsic chromosome properties, such as kinetochore position, are the immediate cause of chromosome distribution in meiosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
