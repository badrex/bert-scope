He investigates nine theorems and discusses the series that apply to this curve. Hellins also provides examples and corrects an error in the length of a large arch of an equilateral hyperbola. He critiques previous works and highlights the limitations of other methods for rectification.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
