They obtained 127 pairs in 2412 exposures with argon or methyl iodide vapor and a Ra-Th source. The results showed a broad distribution of total kinetic energy for the electron pairs and provided insights into the understanding of multiple scattering and energy calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
