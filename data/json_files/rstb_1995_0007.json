It highlights the existence of broken DNA intermediates, including hairpin structures, and explains how these intermediates contribute to the formation of coding joints and the addition of non-templated and templated insertions. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanism and the role of hairpin DNA in V(D)J recombination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
