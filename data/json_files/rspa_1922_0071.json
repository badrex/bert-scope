The authors found that the so-called Newtonian Constant of Gravitation remains constant within the temperature range of 0\u00b0C to 250\u00b0C, which contradicts previous findings. The improved experimental setup and methods of suspension helped to minimize systematic errors and provide more accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Experimental Physics"}
