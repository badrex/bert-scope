The results show that the evaluated large-scale structures in the turbulent jet deviate considerably from the axi-symmetric flow structures at low and moderate Reynolds numbers. The findings reveal a smaller deformation rate of the semi-regular flow structure in the potential core and a rapid radial decrease in the circumferential coherence of the related large-scale flow structure in the mixing region.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
