They discovered that Feshbach resonances dominate the photodissociation spectrum, and found the first evidence of multichannel resonances in the photodissociation spectrum of a diatomic molecule. This study provides insights into the molecular fragmentation dynamics and the influence of non-adiabatic interactions on energy levels and wavefunctions near the dissociation threshold.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
