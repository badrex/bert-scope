They found that the resistivity of these films closely approximates that of bulk metal for thicknesses much larger than the mean free path of conduction electrons. The results confirm this expectation for caesium films, but potassium and rubidium films show a higher resistivity due to residual resistance caused by lattice strain, which can be partially removed by annealing. The findings suggest that these thick films differ from ordinary metal specimens only in being more finely poly-crystalline.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
