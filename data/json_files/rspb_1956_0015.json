The author found that crystal violet delays yeast cell growth, and that the effect is dependent on the inoculum size. The author also discovered that yeast cells can adapt to resist the action of crystal violet and that this adaptation is not connected to the occurrence of mutations. Additionally, the author observed the formation of two types of colonies, primary and secondary, which have different growth characteristics and can coexist in the same strain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Yeast Biology"}
