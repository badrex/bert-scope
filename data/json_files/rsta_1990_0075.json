It covers the progression from experimental zero-energy facilities to prototype reactors and a large commercial-size reactor, highlighting the experience gained from reactor design, construction, and operation. The article also outlines the objectives of the current development program, which aims to reduce the capital cost of fast-reactor plants to compete with pressurized water reactors.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
