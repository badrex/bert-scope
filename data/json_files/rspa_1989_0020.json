The authors use the Barnett-Lothe theory to study the behavior of surface waves and determine the surface-wave speed. They find that unique subsonic surface waves usually exist, and the properties of these waves are different for various configurations and exceptional transonic states. This research provides a better understanding of surface-wave propagation in anisotropic elastic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
