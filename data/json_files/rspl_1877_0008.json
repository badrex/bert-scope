They discovered that the cells forming the nerves arise from the median dorsal ridge of the hind brain and the spinal cord. The cranial and spinal nerves are connected by a longitudinal commissure of spherical cells, and the nerves attach to the summit of the neural canal before shifting to their final positions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
