They found that the majority of the insect species on Aldabra have Ethiopian affinities, with a significant Malagasy influence. The insect fauna is composed of various categories, including African, Seychelles, Oriental, cosmopolitan, and insular species. The authors also studied the butterfly fauna, which is mainly derived from Madagascar, Comoro Islands, and the Seychelles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
