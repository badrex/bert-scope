The authors determined the coefficients using the series-expansion method and examined various forms of intermolecular potential. They found that a Lennard-Jones 6:12 potential accurately represents the second virial coefficient of ethylene, while a small discrepancy in the representation for carbon dioxide may be rectified by introducing a quadrupole interaction term. The research contributes to understanding the properties of gas mixtures in relation to their pure constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
