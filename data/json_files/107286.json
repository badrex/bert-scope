The author, Henry Reeve, examines the connection between cretinism and goitre, a swelling of the thyroid gland. Reeve observes that cretinism is more common in areas with poor air quality, close and humid environments, and inadequate nutrition. He also notes that cretinism often affects children who are born in or move to these areas. The author concludes that cretinism is not solely caused by goitre, and that environmental factors play a significant role in its development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Development"}
