They find that the junction adopts a right-handed, antiparallel-stacked X-structure formed by the pairwise coaxial-stacking of helical arms. The geometry of the junction can be perturbed by the presence of certain base-base mispairs or phosphodiester discontinuities. The four-way DNA junction is selectively cleaved by resolving enzymes, which may recognize the minor groove face of the junction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
