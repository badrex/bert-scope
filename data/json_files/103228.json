Hauksbee describes experiments on the effluvia of glass and the phenomenon of attraction in glass containers. He demonstrates that the effluvia are responsible for the motion of objects within the glass and that the attraction is due to the continuity of the effluvia's parts. Hauksbee also discusses the impact of external factors, such as air pressure and temperature, on the effluvia and their effects on the motion of objects within the glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
