Acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter, was found to be present in the mussel's gill plates and was shown to control the ciliary movement. The study found that low concentrations of acetylcholine and the drug eserine increased ciliary movement, while high concentrations and d-tubocurarine decreased it. These findings support the theory that acetylcholine acts as a local hormone in non-nervous tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurochemistry"}
