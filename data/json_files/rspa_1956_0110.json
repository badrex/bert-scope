The authors found that mild steel requires a higher stress to cause yield under rapid loading than under slow loading. They also discovered that the hardening effect of dynamic working is less than that of static working, which has implications for the material's strength properties after dynamic straining.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
