The study uses animal models and genetic analysis to understand the role of viral components, such as the haemagglutinin, in determining virulence. The research highlights the importance of understanding the genetic and molecular determinants of viral pathogenicity for developing effective treatments and vaccines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
