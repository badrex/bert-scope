They found that the vibrational distribution in N2(B) is similar to that in N2(A), suggesting a complex formation mechanism. The results provide insight into the population of high vibrational levels in N2(B) and the role of N2(A) as a precursor.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
