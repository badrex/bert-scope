This breakthrough could potentially lead to the development of a vaccine for treating leprosy. The researchers also isolated and grew the acid-fast bacillus found in cows with Johne's disease, with plans to develop a diagnostic vaccine in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
