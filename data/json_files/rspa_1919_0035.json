They found that the product of visibility and cloud droplet size is nearly constant for a fixed water content. This discovery helps in understanding the relationship between cloud droplet size, water content, and visibility, which is essential for weather prediction and atmospheric science.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
