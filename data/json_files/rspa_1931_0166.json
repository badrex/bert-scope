They found that the benzene nucleus in hexachlorobenzene has a similar structure and dimensions to the plane ring of six carbon atoms found in graphite. The study provides insight into the arrangement of carbon and chlorine atoms in the molecule and contributes to the understanding of benzene compounds' structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
