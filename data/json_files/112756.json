The method involves drawing air through two glass tubes filled with acidulated water, which absorbs the ammonia. The ammonia is then measured using a Nessler solution. The author discusses the results of experiments conducted in Burton-on-Trent and the surrounding area, and the influence of wind and rain on ammonia levels. The method is found to be more reliable than other methods due to its ability to avoid interference from nitrogenous organic matter and its effectiveness in filtering out ammonia using cotton-wool.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
