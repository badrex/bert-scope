They studied the colony-forming ability and phage-synthetic capacity of Escherichia coli strain B and two of its mutants following alkylation. The results showed that the sensitivity of the strains to alkylating agents varied, and that phage-synthetic capacity was less sensitive to alkylation than colony-forming ability. The authors suggest that ribonucleic acids may be the reactive substrate essential to phage-synthetic capacity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
