W. Herschel, explores various transformations and equations related to conic sections, focusing on properties of the functions x and x'. He applies these equations to parabolas and demonstrates how they can be used to calculate angles and other properties of the conic sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analytic Geometry"}
