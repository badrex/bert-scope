It explains how radicals can be stabilized and controlled through redox potentials, local reactivity, and physical protection. The article also highlights the use of radicals in extracellular space, generation and reaction of radicals, and their role in vesicles and organelles. Finally, it explores the use of radicals in energy capture and the coupling of chemistry of electrons and protons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
