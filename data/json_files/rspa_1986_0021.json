They found that the decomposition proceeds in two distinct steps, with the first step involving the formation of copper(I) malonate and the second step being the decomposition of copper(I) malonate. The study used a combination of kinetic, microscopic, and analytical measurements to understand the reaction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
