It explores the limitations of traditional biochemical approaches and highlights the potential of molecular genetics to provide new insights into the regulation of these processes. The author presents examples of using genetically manipulated plants to study the role of specific enzymes in controlling flux through metabolic pathways and the contribution of Rubisco to the control of photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
