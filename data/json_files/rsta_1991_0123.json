Canards are found in fast-slow dynamical systems and are related to the stable and unstable manifolds of the phase plane. The author presents a new approach to characterize canards using the inflection line, which is the locus of points with zero curvature in the phase plane. This approach is applied to various chemical systems, including the oscillatory EOE reaction, the Autocatalator, and the two-variable Oregonator.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
