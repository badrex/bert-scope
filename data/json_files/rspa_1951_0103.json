They propose the self-consistent LCAO method to improve the accuracy of bond lengths and electronegativity predictions. The method is applied to various molecules, showing promising results, but remains challenging for large conjugated systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Orbital Theory"}
