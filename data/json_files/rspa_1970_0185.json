The author demonstrates that there exist an infinite number of such forests for all n \u2265 4. The study uses mathematical concepts like graph theory, combinatorics, and number theory to analyze the structures and patterns of these forests.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics"}
