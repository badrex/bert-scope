The author demonstrates the ease with which physiological changes can be observed and studied in insects due to their small size, diverse species, and tolerance for various experimental conditions. The lecture provides examples of these processes, including the breakdown of hemoglobin in Rhodnius prolixus and the role of epidermal cells in wound healing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
