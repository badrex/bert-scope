They measured their brightness temperatures and intensity distributions over the wavelength range from 2580 to 4520 \u00c5. The intensity per unit wave number was found to be independent of wave number for the Lyman and coaxial tubes, while for the capillary flash, the region independent of wave number extended up to 31,000, after which the continuum decreased exponentially. The results were in agreement with the Unsold-Kramers theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
