They use complex variable techniques to simplify the theory and express the stress equations of equilibrium in a more compact form. This approach can be applied to a wider range of problems related to flat plates and cylinders with curved surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
