They found that this species is mainly an outdoor sandfly and feeds more readily on cows and dogs than humans. The study also investigated the breeding habits and feeding behavior of P. perniciosus, which plays a significant role in the transmission of diseases like sandfly fever and Kala Azar.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
