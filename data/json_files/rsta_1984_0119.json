They found that the waveguiding structure exhibits the same bistable behavior as a nonlinear interface, with instabilities occurring at specific incident intensities. The feedback mechanism is provided by the evanescent field in the nonlinear medium, affecting the phase shift between incident and reflected beams.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
