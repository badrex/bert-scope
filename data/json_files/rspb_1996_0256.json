They used a well-known population model and showed that assuming white noise can lead to a severe underestimation of extinction probabilities. The study highlights the importance of understanding the properties of environmental noise, particularly its autocorrelation, for population ecology and conservation biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
