Two main types of transitions in wear processes are observed: a change from severe to mild wear, and a change from mild to severe wear. The findings provide a general pattern of wear behavior and help predict the circumstances in which these transitions might occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
