Dr. Garden observed that the prickly pear caused a red color in the urine of tested subjects, while the indigo plant dyed cow's milk blue. This led to further experiments and potential future research on the plants' dye-producing properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
