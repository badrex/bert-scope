The modified theory leads to Maxwell's equations with a different restriction on the current density, resulting in a charge distribution more likely to correspond to a particle. The authors argue that no simpler non-symmetric theory is likely to give these equations in their conventional form.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
