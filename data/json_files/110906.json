He conducts experiments in the Mer de Glace, measuring the relative motion of different parts of the glacier using trigonometry. The results show that the motion is gradual and uninterrupted, with the speed increasing as the distance from the sides of the glacier increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
