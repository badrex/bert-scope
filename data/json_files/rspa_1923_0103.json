They observed that the motion of a cylinder or sphere in a rotating fluid creates a unique pattern of vortices and streamlines. The experiments showed that the fluid behaves as if a solid cylindrical body were being moved through it, providing insights into the complex interactions between rotating fluids and solid objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
