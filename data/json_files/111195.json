They investigated the nature of iron attraction on the poles of magnets and designed a compound needle that could help determine the amount of deviation due to iron masses. The author believed that further experiments were needed to make the instrument simple and accurate enough for general use.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Navigation and Instruments"}
