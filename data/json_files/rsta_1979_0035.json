It explains that the movement of uranium is largely governed by water movement and partial melting. The study finds that medium to high-pressure granulite facies rocks are depleted in uranium, suggesting that uranium moves upward in the crust during metamorphism. This implies that uranium is mobile during metamorphic processes, even though its exact mechanism is not yet understood.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
