Russell, extends the Calculus of Symbols to non-linear differential equations. He provides a notation to find the conditions for a non-linear function to be externally divisible by the symbol of differentiation and extends the investigation to the symbolical division of non-linear functions by linear functions of the symbol of differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus of Symbols"}
