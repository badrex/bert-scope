He discovered that a certain amount of nitrogen disappears during the reaction, and that potassium is converted into potash. Davy also found that the gas produced during the reaction is a mixture of hydrogen and nitrogen, and that nitrogen is not a metal that alloys with other metals. These findings contribute to the understanding of the chemical properties and reactions of potassium and ammonia."}
