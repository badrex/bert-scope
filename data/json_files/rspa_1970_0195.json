The authors discuss the principles of designing suitable instrumentation for such observations and describe the development of infrared techniques to extend remote temperature measurements to higher altitudes and design a simple, robust radiometer for remote sounding of the lower atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
