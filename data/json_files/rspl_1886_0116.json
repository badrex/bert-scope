They discovered that a proteolytic enzyme, present in the germinating seed, breaks down proteids into simpler compounds like peptone, leucine, and asparagine. The enzyme works best in a slightly acidic environment and is destroyed by contact with alkalis. This research provides insight into the process of seed germination and the role of enzymes in plant growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
