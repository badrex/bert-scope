The authors demonstrate the potential of Laue diffraction in dynamic studies, despite challenges such as crystal imperfections and synchronization issues. They analyze the effects of pH, crystal quality, and exposure times on the reliability of Laue results and discuss the importance of high-quality crystals for accurate measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Enzyme Mechanism and Catalysis"}
