They improved the experimental methods to obtain more accurate results, confirming earlier investigations. The study focused on the permanent gases and used a broader beam of light to observe deeper layers of gas, which helped in understanding the polarization properties of scattered light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
