The study finds that argon is more abundant in the Earth's crust than neon, suggesting that neon may have escaped from the atmosphere in the past. The research also discusses the methods used to extract and analyze the gases from rocks, including heating and chemical decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
