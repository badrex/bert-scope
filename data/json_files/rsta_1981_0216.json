It explains that most interstellar molecules are stable compounds, but some are ions, radicals, and reactive carbon chains. The heavy atom backbone of these molecules is a linear chain, and they are mainly observed in rotational transitions at millimeter wavelengths. The molecular clouds where these molecules are found play a central role in star formation and galactic structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrochemistry"}
