They study the viscosity and thickness of the liquid films, as well as the role of electrical double-layer repulsive forces in supporting the normal load. The findings provide insights into the design of windscreen wiper blades and the understanding of rubber-glass contacts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Tribology"}
