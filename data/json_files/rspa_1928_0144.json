They discuss the selection rules and the transitions involved, which are crucial for understanding the behavior of water molecules. The study provides evidence that the singlet series violates the selection rule, leading to a deeper understanding of molecular spectroscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
