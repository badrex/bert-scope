By using a cylindrical shape with a conical apex and a vent for the explosive charge, these shells can be ignited by percussion and maintain a consistent spiral motion during flight. The author's experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of these shells in damaging targets and suggests potential applications for military purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Military Technology"}
