He conducted research on the behavior of Siamese fighting fishes and made innovative use of mirrors and models to analyze the interaction between fighting males. Lissmann later worked in the Cambridge Zoology Department, where he continued his research on animal behavior and made significant contributions to the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
