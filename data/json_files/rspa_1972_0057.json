They investigated the reactions between radical anions of aromatic hydrocarbons and another hydrocarbon with a higher electron affinity. The experiments were conducted in tetrahydrofuran (THF) and tetrahydropyran (THP) solutions, and the results provided insights into the rate constants for electron transfer in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
