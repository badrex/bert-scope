They found that the diminution in illuminating-power is directly proportional to the diminution in atmospheric pressure. This led them to doubt the commonly accepted theory that the light of a gas-flame and luminous flames in general is due to the presence of phosphorus or other similar substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
