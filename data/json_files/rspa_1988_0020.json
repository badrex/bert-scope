It explores the conditions for the existence of slip waves and introduces the possibility of a new slip-wave mode called the second slip-wave mode due to elastic anisotropy. The study emphasizes the need for a more detailed understanding of the behavior of anisotropic materials in surface-wave theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid mechanics"}
