They mention that some proteids produce a rose-red color, while others produce a violet color. The author also compares the color reactions of proteids to those of cyanuric acid, hydrocyanic acid, and biuret, and suggests that the differences in color reactions are due to different combinations of cyanogen in the molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
