They found that the spectrum is closely related to acetylene and is produced during combustion. The authors also examined the electric arc spectrum in different gases and observed that the hydrocarbon flame spectrum is connected to hydrogen and carbon in the form of acetylene.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
