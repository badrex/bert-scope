They find that these cells are derived from the germinal epithelium and undergo differentiation to form ova and follicle cells. The study provides insights into the complex process of ovogenesis and the role of interstitial cells in the ovary's function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
