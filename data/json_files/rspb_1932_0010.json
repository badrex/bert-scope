The author describes the methods used to study the effects of varying amboceptor and complement concentrations on haemolytic systems. The results show that the time for complete haemolysis increases as the concentration of complement decreases, and the findings suggest that the complement acts as a simple haemolysin in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
