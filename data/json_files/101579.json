He proposes that halos are formed by small, icy grains with a transparent and opaque layer, and that parhelia are created by elongated ice crystals. The author also explains the colors and shapes of these atmospheric features, attributing them to refraction and the properties of the ice crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
