They discovered two transient absorption spectra in the regions of 2400 and 2950 \u00c5, which were caused by the photosensitizing action of chlorine. The study provides insights into the chemical reactions and spectroscopic properties of nitrogen trichloride and chlorine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
