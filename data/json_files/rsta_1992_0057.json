They develop a nonlinear theory using the three-dimensional unsteady Euler equations and find that the motion near the wing-tips becomes multi-structured, with two possible mechanisms for nonlinearity to affect the evolution significantly. The author also discusses the implications of these findings for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
