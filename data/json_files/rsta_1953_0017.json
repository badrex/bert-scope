They consider a spherical sheet ionosphere with ionization density independent of geographical position and a semi-diurnal tidal air motion. The effective conductivity of the ionosphere is enhanced, taking into account both direct and transverse conductivities. The authors find that the currents and fields in both zones are considerably more intense than those deduced on the assumption that only direct conductivity is effective. The electric field system is very different from previous calculations, and an abnormally large east-west current is found at the equator, which provides an explanation for the anomalous magnetic variation in this region.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
