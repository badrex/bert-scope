They analyze the effects of different boundary conditions and present solutions for various scenarios, including cases with two parallel boundaries. The study provides insights into the behavior of fluids in applications such as lubrication and offers a deeper understanding of fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
