The study reveals a connection between the medulla oblongata and the feeding habits of the fish, such as surface feeding, plankton feeding, and ground feeding. The research also highlights the importance of further investigating the relationship between brain structure and fish behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
