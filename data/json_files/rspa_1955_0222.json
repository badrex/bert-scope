They used infra-red absorption spectrometry and chemical methods to analyze the gas samples extracted from the flame. The findings provide insights into the ignition and combustion mechanisms of ethyl nitrate and other complex nitric esters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Mechanisms"}
