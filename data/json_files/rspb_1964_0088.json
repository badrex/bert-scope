By comparing individual characters, the researchers found that size differences account for a large amount of variation between island stocks. The mice from certain groups of localities show close affinity to each other, but there is no clear overall island pattern that readily separates these mice from those on the mainland. The results suggest that further research on the patterns of morphological change in mammals isolated on small islands is needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
