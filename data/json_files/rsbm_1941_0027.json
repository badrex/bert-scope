He discovered the remarkable properties of steel containing specific proportions of manganese, which revolutionized the steel industry and led to the creation of a new type of steel that was extremely hard and tough. Hadfield's work laid the foundation for further research in metallurgy and material science.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
