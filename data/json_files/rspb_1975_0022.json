It explores self- and interspecific incompatibility patterns in Betula, Alnus, Quercus, and other genera, as well as the absence of self-incompatibility in conifers. The article highlights the importance of understanding these mechanisms for forest tree improvement and breeding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
