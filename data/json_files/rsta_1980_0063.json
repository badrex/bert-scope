They found that wood's high work of fracture is due to the unique structure of its cells, which have helically wound cellulose fibrillae that can buckle under tension, leading to a large amount of energy absorption. This research led to the creation of new composite materials with high work of fracture and low density, which can be used in various engineering applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
