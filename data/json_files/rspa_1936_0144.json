They analyzed the spectrum of these molecules and found that the spin fine structure of the rotational levels of the states of PH and PD can be explained by Kramers' formulae. The substitution of deuterium for hydrogen in the molecule reduces the spin-orbit coupling constant, but the spin-spin coupling constant remains almost unchanged.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
