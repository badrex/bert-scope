They find that growth proceeds by branching and divergence of individual dominant lamellae, forming a framework within which subsidiary growth occurs, eventually giving spherulites. The essential origin of spherulitic growth is identified as the tendency for adjacent dominant lamellae to diverge from spatially distributed branch points.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
