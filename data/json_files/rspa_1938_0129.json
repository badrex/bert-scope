The instruments, which include a barometer and thermometer, control the modulation frequency of the radio transmitter, allowing for continuous recording of pressure and temperature during the balloon's ascent. This method provides a more accurate and efficient way to gather aerological data compared to previous techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
