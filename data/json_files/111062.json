The phenomenon was characterized by a milky-white, compact belt of light forming a magnificent arch in the sky. The author observed that the dark cloud may have served as a conductor, feeding the zone and drawing off the matter of the aurora from the north. No prismatic tints were visible during this event.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Atmospheric Sciences"}
