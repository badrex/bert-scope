The authors developed a constant temperature enclosure and utilized the Joule-Thomson cooling effect to study the heat capacity of metals like copper, lead, and silver. The results contribute to bridging the gap between Nernst's observations at liquid hydrogen and liquid air temperatures and higher temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
