They found that reducing extracellular potassium concentration or applying the cardiotonic steroid strophanthidin increased Isi and twitch tension. The study concluded that these effects were mediated by sodium pump inhibition, and not by the instantaneous sodium pump turnover rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
