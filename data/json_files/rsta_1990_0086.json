It highlights the need for descriptive and genetic terminology in studying plate tectonics and criticizes the use of geographic terrane nomenclature, which often lacks context and understanding of plate interactions. The author emphasizes the significance of actualistic plate tectonics and the features of modern plate systems in comprehending ancient orogenic belts.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
