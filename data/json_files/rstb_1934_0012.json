They describe a new method of preparing polished serial sections to better understand the internal characters of these fossils, which has led to improved classification and identification of species. This research helps to establish relationships between brachiopod forms more accurately than previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
