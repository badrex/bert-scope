He demonstrated that the brain and nerves contribute significantly to muscle movement and that this action cannot be due to elasticity. Stuart concluded that the action of nerves in muscle movement is caused by the fluid they contain, which he suggests is similar to the properties of air, even though it is invisible.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
