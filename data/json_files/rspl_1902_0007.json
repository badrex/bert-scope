They find that the plant's extract, even in small quantities, is almost fatal to fishes. The study reveals that the toxic effects are due to the presence of tannic acid, resin, and other compounds in the plant. The findings provide insights into the traditional use of the Spurge plant to poison fishes in Ireland.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Aquatic Biology"}
