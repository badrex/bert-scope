The author finds that these traits do not follow the law of ancestral heredity and suggests that exclusive inheritance without reversion may be a more accurate description of these phenomena. The study also highlights the importance of further research on the intensity and form of inheritance for various characters in different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
