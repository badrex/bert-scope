The clean surface is shown to be unreconstructed, and evidence is presented that dinitrogen is completely dissociated at the surface. The chemisorption regime of ammonia is a mixed one, with extensive dehydrogenation occurring at low coverage and associative sorption at higher coverage. The study contributes to understanding nitrogen and ammonia chemisorption on clean Fe(111) surfaces and the reaction of adsorbed species with hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
