They developed a new method and apparatus to increase the accuracy of the method and ensure the catalyst's longevity. The results showed that the activity of the copper catalyst varied periodically with temperature, providing insights into the factors affecting catalytic reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
