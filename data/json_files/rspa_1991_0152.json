The study focuses on the characteristics of the short waves over the whole profile of the longer waves, providing insights into mean-square steepness, phase and amplitude modulation, and correlation between short and long waves. The model is applied to laboratory and field data, offering valuable information for air-sea transfer processes and remote sensing of ocean surfaces."}
