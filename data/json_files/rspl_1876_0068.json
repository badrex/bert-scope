He also discussed the work of Louis Pasteur, who demonstrated that sterilized urine, when mixed with heated potash, does not develop life. Tyndall's experiments, along with Pasteur's findings, debunked the idea of spontaneous generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
