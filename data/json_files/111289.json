The author, Philip Henry Gosse, describes the distinct features of male and female Rotifera, such as the atrophy of the digestive system in males and the great disparity in size and organization between the sexes. Gosse also compares the sexual differences in Rotifera to those found in Crustacea, suggesting a similar zoological rank for both groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
