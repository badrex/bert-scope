They determined the temperature and composition ranges for slow reaction, explosion, and single and multiple cool flames. They found that the concentration of peroxides increases before a cool flame and decreases rapidly as it passes. The results contribute to the understanding of hydrocarbon combustion and the role of intermediate peroxides in cool flame combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
