It revisits Muller's 1950 paper on the genetic decay of the human species due to increasing mutation pressure and relaxation of natural selection. The author concludes that while there is a certain increase in malformations and diseases due to these factors, genetic counseling, antenatal diagnosis, and research on the biological conditions of mutagenic chemicals can help reduce genetic risks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
