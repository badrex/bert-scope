They used a vacuum-tight joint between a sealed radium bulb and a McLeod gauge to measure the pressure of the accumulated helium. The experiment showed that the rate of helium production from 70 milligrams of radium chloride was 0.463 cubic millimeters of helium per gram of radium per day.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
