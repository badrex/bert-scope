He observed the chemical composition of lava and the surrounding environment, concluding that volcanic fires depend on the oxidation of metals in the Earth's crust. His findings debunked previous hypotheses attributing volcanic fires to chemical reactions like the combustion of mineral coal or the action of sulfur on iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
