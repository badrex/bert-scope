This theory combines elements of tidal and accretion theories and explains the formation of planets and their orbits. The author suggests that the star provided the planetary material and that the process of losing material under tidal force could form planetary condensations with the required range of orbital radii.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar System Formation"}
