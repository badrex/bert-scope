The authors improve upon previous methods by allowing the maximum latitude of the subsatellite point to vary, providing more accurate predictions of satellite motion. The study focuses on near-Earth satellites and offers a deeper understanding of their orbital dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
