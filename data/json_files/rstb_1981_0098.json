Zinc is a functionally essential component of over 120 enzymes and is crucial for transcription and translation. It affects the metabolism of RNA polymerases, mRNA, and proteins, including histones and arginine-containing peptides. Zinc plays a fundamental role in gene activation and repression, which accounts for its widespread effects on cell metabolism. Deficiency in zinc can lead to growth arrest, developmental issues, and various diseases in animals and humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
