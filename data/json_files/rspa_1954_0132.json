The authors employ a virtual work approach to analyze collapse mechanisms and develop a geometrical analogue to minimize the linear function of weight, subject to constraints. The method is illustrated with a two-span beam example.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
