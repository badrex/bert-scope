It discusses stress-strain relationships, strain definitions, and the elastic energy stored in deformed bodies. The authors also explore the assumptions of incompressibility and the neo-Hookean elasticity model for a wide range of elastic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
