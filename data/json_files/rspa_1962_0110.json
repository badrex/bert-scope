The model considers the molecule as consisting of an active group inside a self-consistent molecular field, with the interaction of the active group with the molecular field playing a crucial role. The mechanism involves two distinct types of temperature-dependent and temperature-independent transitions, which cannot be fully explained by the conventional Debye-Frohlich mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
