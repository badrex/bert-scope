They explore the different types of evidence connecting the action of an analogue with its parent growth factor, including antagonism in action, specificity of action, and characters of the action of the analogue. The study highlights the importance of understanding the function of individual essential metabolites in cell metabolism for the profitable exploitation of growth-factor analogues as potential chemotherapeutic agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology and Immunology"}
