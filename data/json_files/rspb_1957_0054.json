Researchers found that underfeeding delayed the onset of fructose and citric acid secretion, as well as sperm appearance, due to inadequate stimulation of the gonads by gonadotrophic hormones. Injections of gonadotrophin prompted the appearance of both fructose and citric acid in the semen, highlighting the importance of proper nutrition for reproductive health in male animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Physiology"}
