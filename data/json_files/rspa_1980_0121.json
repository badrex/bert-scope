They observed and analyzed its microwave rotational spectrum, determining its molecular geometry and electric dipole moment. The study aimed to establish the configuration at the oxygen atom in the heterodimer and the height of the barrier, if any, between different conformations. The results suggest that the dimer has a planar or effectively planar configuration with a low barrier to inversion of the configuration at oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
