Seeds of different types were placed in vacuum tubes and tubes with specific gases for extended periods. When the seeds were removed and planted, they germinated similarly to seeds kept in normal air conditions. This study showed that neither vacuum nor specific gas atmospheres significantly affected seed germination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
