They observed four main absorption lines, which they assigned to the fundamental, second, and third harmonic transitions of the localized vibrations of hydrogen and deuterium ions on fluorine sites. The temperature-dependent line widths and peak positions of these absorption lines were measured and analyzed, providing insights into the anharmonic effects and interactions with the lattice vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
