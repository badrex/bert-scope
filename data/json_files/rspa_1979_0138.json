The authors identify four classes of polynomials and calculate the corresponding metrics, which are relevant to quantum gravity. They also discuss the relationship between these metrics and Maxwell fields, and provide examples of metrics in different coordinate systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
