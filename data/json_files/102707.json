Hauksbee", "semantic_tags": ["Electromagnetism", "Light production", "Glass physics", "Effluvia", "Atmospheric electricity"], "tldr": "Fr. Hauksbee conducted an experiment to study the production of light by the effluvia of one glass falling on another in motion. He discovered that the effluvia of glass were capable of exhibiting a phenomenon, and that motion was necessary for light production. The experiment also showed that the strength of the light was most apparent on the side of the glass nearest the attrition. Hauksbee suggested that the effluvia of glass become capable of acting like a solid body and that the medium in the inward glass was required to produce light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
