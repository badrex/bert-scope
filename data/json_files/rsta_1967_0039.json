The authors analyze the orbital inclinations of three satellites to determine Love's number, which is a measure of the Earth's deformation due to the Moon and Sun. They also consider various perturbations affecting the satellites' orbits, such as lunisolar gravitational attractions and the motion of the Earth's equator.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
