They found that the excess absorption can be attributed to a relaxation phenomenon involving the perturbation of molecular equilibrium between single and double molecules of acetic acid. The results confirm both dispersion and the maximum value of absorption required by a relaxation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
