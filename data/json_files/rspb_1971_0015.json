They found that both 'early' and 'late' mutants can initiate cellular DNA synthesis at high and low temperatures, suggesting that the viral gene controlling this process is not affected by temperature sensitivity. This discovery sheds light on the complex relationship between viral and cellular DNA synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
