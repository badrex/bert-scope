The researchers found that lesions in the preoptic region of the hypothalamus blocked testicular growth, while deafferentation slightly more posterior or rostral to the preoptic area had no effect on gonadotrophin secretion. The results suggest a role for the anterior hypothalamus in the photoperiodic response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroendocrinology"}
