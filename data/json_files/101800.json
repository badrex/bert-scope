Du Vernay, conducted an anatomical study of the nose structure and the mechanism of smelling. He observed that the nose's labyrinthine structure, made by the windings of the lamellae, helps to arrest and prolong the stay of odorant particles. The nose is also equipped with numerous small glands that secrete a thick, slimy substance to better entangle dry odorant particles. The delicacy of smelling in different animals is related to the number and length of the lamellae in their nasal structures. Animals with better smelling abilities, such as hounds, have more lamellae and a more extended nose structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
