They distinguish between the processes of transmission and expression and find that the evolutionarily stable host sex ratio will be biased towards the non-transmitting sex, provided that transmission and feminization efficiencies are not both 100%. This may lead to monogeny, where uninfected females produce only the non-transmitting sex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
