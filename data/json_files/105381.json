He discovered that glass can be permeable by electricity and that the Tourmaline can help determine which side is electrified plus or minus. This research contributes to understanding the properties of electric fluids and the existence of a medium on the surfaces of bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
