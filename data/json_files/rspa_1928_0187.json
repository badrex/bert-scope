They found that the reaction kinetics were similar for all metals, and the reaction became unimolecular at higher pressures. The authors also investigated the influence of initial acetaldehyde pressure, temperature, and the presence of carbon monoxide on the reaction rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
