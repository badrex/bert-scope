They found that growth substance, which inhibits root growth, is produced by the root tip and plays a crucial part in both geotropic and traumatic curvatures. The distribution of growth substance is disturbed by the stimulus of gravity, leading to unequal growth and curvature. The authors also discovered that the growth inhibitory substance found on the surface of amputated root tips is an exudation of preformed growth substance, not a wound hormone as previously suggested.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
