They found that GABA increases the membrane conductance and decreases the effective capacity in a dose-related manner. The results suggest that GABA may selectively increase the conductance of cleft-tubular membranes in the muscle fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
