He is best known for his work on the Podostemaceae family of plants and his development of the \"age and area\" hypothesis, which proposed that the range of a species is determined by its age. Willis also challenged the theory of natural selection and proposed alternative mechanisms for evolution, such as large-scale mutations and the divergence theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology and Ecology"}
