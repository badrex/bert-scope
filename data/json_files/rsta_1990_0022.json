They suggest that some of these lines may have a solar source, connecting the Sun and climate through hydromagnetic and bolometric variations. The study also explores the connection between radiocarbon periodicities and atmosphere-ocean resonances, providing insights into Earth's climate history and the relationship between solar activity and climate change.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
