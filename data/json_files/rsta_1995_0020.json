They focus on the effects of an abrupt diffusivity cut-off on the chemical concentration and the formation of travelling wave structures. The research provides insights into the polymerization processes and the behavior of chemical species in different zones.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": ">-"}
