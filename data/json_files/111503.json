W. Hofmann, studied the reaction between triethylphosphine and bisulfide of carbon, resulting in a deep crimson-colored crystalline compound. This reaction can be used as a test for detecting traces of triethylphosphine. The new compound is insoluble in water and ether but soluble in alcohol. Its constitution is similar to the mineral compound, sulphocarbamate of ammonium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
