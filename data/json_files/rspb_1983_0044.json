The authors found that these lipids exhibit complex polymorphic behavior involving the formation of stable and metastable structural forms. The relative proportions of these forms depend on the thermal history of the samples. The study highlights the importance of understanding the properties of plant glycolipids, particularly those of more saturated derivatives, for their role in plant membrane fluidity and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Lipids"}
