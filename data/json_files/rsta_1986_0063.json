The research focuses on the interactional effects between CO species chemisorbed on Ni(111) and the influence of local electrostatic effects in the vicinity of the adsorbate. The findings provide evidence for both types of interactional effects in adlayers on a Ni(111) single-crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
