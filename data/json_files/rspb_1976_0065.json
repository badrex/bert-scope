The researchers found that at high altitudes, the metabolic response to food is diminished, which aids in energy conservation and efficient utilization of food energy. However, this lack of thermic response can also lead to a disadvantage in maintaining body temperature in cold environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
