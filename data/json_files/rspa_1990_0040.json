They analyze the similarities and differences between this model and the homogeneous equilibrium model, focusing on dispersion, characteristics, choking, and shock waves. The study reveals the existence of two limiting velocities of wave propagation and the critical velocity of choking, which is the frozen speed of sound. The analysis also demonstrates that transition from one phase to another can only occur via a singular point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
