The gene for the high-affinity route is localized to a specific restriction fragment and is found to involve the open-reading frame f445. This discovery helps understand the role of membrane proteins in adenine transport and the regulation of transport systems in bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
