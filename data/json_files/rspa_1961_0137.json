The instrument is tested with the high-frequency discharge spectrum of mercury, providing accurate and reproducible single intensity measurements. The mercury isotope abundances are determined from spectral intensity measurements, agreeing well with mass-spectrometer values. The spectrometer's potential applications include rapidly varying phenomena in gas discharges, shock waves, and refractive index measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
