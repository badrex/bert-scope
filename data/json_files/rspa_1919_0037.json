They observed that the fracture follows the boundaries between crystals and proposed an explanation based on the hypothesis of an amorphous intercrystalline cement. This study has implications for understanding the failure of materials like brass, lead, and steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
