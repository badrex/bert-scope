They identified six different potassium channels with various conductances, ion selectivities, and voltage sensitivities. None of the channels were found to be mechanically sensitive to suction stimuli. This research provides insights into the complex changes in membrane potential in fibroblasts and their responses to external stimuli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
