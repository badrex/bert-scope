The new Hamiltonian is expressed in terms of gauge-invariant field strengths and electric and magnetic multipole moments of the molecules, providing a more general and powerful approach to the study of molecular quantum electrodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
