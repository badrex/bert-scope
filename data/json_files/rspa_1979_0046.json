They discovered two distinct zones along the rake face, with the first zone showing relative movement at the chip-tool interface and the second zone experiencing gross transfer of material onto the tool. The study provides insights into the contact conditions and tool wear in machining processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metalworking"}
