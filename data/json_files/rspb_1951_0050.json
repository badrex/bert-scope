They found that the (\u2212)-isomer had high activity, while the (+)-isomer had negligible activity in various tests, including the Went pea test, Avena cylinder test, tomato-leaf epinasty, and rooting of cuttings. This demonstrates that one optically active form of a growth substance can induce different growth responses in plants, while its enantiomorph can be inactive.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
