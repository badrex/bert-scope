The structure confirms that streptomycin consists of three fragments: an N-methyl-glucosamine ring, an streptose, and a streptidine ring, linked together by two glycosidic bonds. The crystal structure contains an elaborate network of hydrogen bonds linking selenate and streptomycin oxime ions and water molecules. This study validates the absolute configurations of the three rings and provides insights into the structure of the antibiotic.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
