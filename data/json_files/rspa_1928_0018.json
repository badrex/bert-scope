They find that the best determinations of electronic emission for pure metals like tungsten, molybdenum, tantalum, and platinum agree with a value of 60 amperes per square centimeter. However, metals affected by surface impurities require smaller values, as low as 3 amperes per square centimeter. The author also discusses the reflection coefficient and its relation to surface layers and temperature ranges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
