These corpuscles are connected by filaments and are hollow with cavities that sometimes communicate with the canals. The dimensions of these corpuscles are extremely small, ranging from the 10,000th to the 4,000th part of an inch in diameter and the 2,300th to the 1,400th part in length.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
