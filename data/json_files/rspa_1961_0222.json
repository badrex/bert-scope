The study focuses on the spanwise distribution of lift coefficient, flow features far downstream from the cascade, and induced drag due to non-uniform lift distribution. The authors provide a theoretical analysis with numerical examples, contributing to the understanding of non-uniform flow through cascades of lifting surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
