They consider uniform and geometric distributions of data points and find that geometric sampling reduces the number of required sample points for inversion, improving the restoration of exponential components. This has significant implications for the design of scientific experiments and instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
