The results support the ionization theory and provide insights into the degree of ionization in dilute solutions. The study also compares the conclusions drawn from the freezing point depression and conductivity measurements, offering a better understanding of the behavior of electrolyte solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
