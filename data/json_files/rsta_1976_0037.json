They develop a general method to derive the temperature and density structure and energy balance in both quiet Sun and active regions. The study also examines the mechanical energy required to balance conductive flux and radiation losses, comparing empirical damping lengths with those expected from conduction damping of sound waves or viscous damping of Alfven waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
