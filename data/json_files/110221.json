He demonstrates that the polarizing force of a refracting surface changes the position of the planes of polarized light. Brewster establishes the true laws of the phenomena through experiments and deduces a formula representing the variation of the rotation corresponding to the deviation of the refracted ray. He concludes that refraction cannot produce rays truly polarized, and each refracting surface produces a change in the position of the planes of polarization, approaching complete polarization.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
