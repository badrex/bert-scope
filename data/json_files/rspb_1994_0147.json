The presence of additional females and males in the environment increased aggression and reduced feeding bouts. The lost feeding time could have significant fitness consequences for female guppies, as reduced food intake can affect their fecundity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
