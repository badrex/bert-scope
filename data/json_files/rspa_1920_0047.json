They find that the hydrogen nucleus is oblate, and their calculations show better agreement with experimental observations than Sommerfeld's relativistic formula. This work contributes to the understanding of atomic structure and the behavior of electrons in atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
