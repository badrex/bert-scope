They used electrolysis of strong aqueous hydrochloric acid to create a gas containing equal volumes of chlorine and hydrogen, which was sensitive to light exposure. The new instrument allowed them to investigate the laws of chemical action of light and discover the phenomenon of photochemical induction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
