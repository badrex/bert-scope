They isolated clones carrying genes expressed specifically in the ligninolytic phase, developed a strategy for mapping these clones, and elucidated the mating system of the organism. The authors also discussed the potential for DNA transformation, site-directed mutagenesis, and strain improvement through genetic crosses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
