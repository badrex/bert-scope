Poynting and Guy Barlow to measure the pressure of light against its source, known as the recoil from light. They used a series of discs with different configurations to study the pressure exerted by light on the source. The results showed that light pressure is a real phenomenon and has implications for understanding the interaction between light and matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
