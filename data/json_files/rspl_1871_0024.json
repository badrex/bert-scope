The author highlights the differences in muscle arrangement and development, such as the great pectoral and cutaneous muscles, and discusses the importance of nerve supply in identifying disputed muscles. The research also corrects previous errors in the understanding of bat myology and suggests that each group of bats has a slightly different arrangement of muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
