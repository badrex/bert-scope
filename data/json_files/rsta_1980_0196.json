The orbit was determined using various observations, and the author found that the satellite passed through the 31:2 geopotential resonance, allowing them to analyze variations in eccentricity and inclination. The results provided crucial tests for geopotential models and confirmed the accuracy of atmospheric rotation rates at different heights.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Science"}
