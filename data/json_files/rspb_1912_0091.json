They discovered that the sectional area of the aorta is proportional to the blood volume of the individual and can be calculated using a formula that relates body weight, surface area, and a constant specific to each species. This research helps in understanding the relationship between aortic size, body weight, and surface area in warm-blooded animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
