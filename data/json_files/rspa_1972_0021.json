They found that the kinetics of the reaction are consistent with a mechanism involving ligand displacement by the monomer, leading to a reactive species that can be oxidized by the halide. The authors determined the rate constants, equilibrium constants, and associated enthalpy and entropy changes for the reaction, providing a better understanding of the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
