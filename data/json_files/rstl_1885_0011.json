They also find that some Actini\u00e6 contain a pigment that closely resembles biliverdin, and they study its properties and behavior. The author uses spectroscopy and various chemical treatments to analyze the pigments and their spectra, providing valuable insights into the chromatology of these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
