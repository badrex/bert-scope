The experiments were unsuccessful, leading to skepticism about their validity. Additionally, the article examines the controversy surrounding Professor Bose's Beatification experiment, in which a person's head is supposedly surrounded by a luminous glow after being electrified. Despite many attempts, the experiment could not be replicated, and its authenticity remains in question.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
