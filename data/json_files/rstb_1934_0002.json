They discovered that the chameleon's color response is influenced by both light and heat, and that the range of pigmentary response is not reduced by blinding. The study also confirmed that the chameleon's color change is affected by the background, supporting the idea that reptiles do not form an exception to the general rule of background effects on chromatic responses in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reptile Biology"}
