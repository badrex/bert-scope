The authors analyze the effects of compressibility and investigate the different modes of motion that can transmit pressure effects with the velocity of sound in the medium. They also discuss the limitations of the instantaneity of propagation in such systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
