They used isotopically labeled ammonium phosphate to trace the pathways of nitrogen assimilation and amino acid synthesis. The results showed that glutamic acid and glutamine are the primary acids to derive their nitrogen directly from ammonia, while other amino acids derive their nitrogen from glutamic acid. The study also provided insights into the regulation mechanisms of the cell and the pathways of amino acid biosynthesis in microorganisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
