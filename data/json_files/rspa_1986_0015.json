They identify various patterns of dependence of the stationary-state extent of conversion on the residence time (bifurcation diagrams) and analyze the ranges of experimental conditions where these patterns occur. The study has implications for understanding chemical feedback, enzyme reactions, and population growth in mathematical biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Reaction Kinetics"}
