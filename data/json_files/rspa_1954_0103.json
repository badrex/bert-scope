The introduction of these new propagators creates new infinities that cannot be removed by renormalization. A tentative prescription is proposed to address these difficulties, but it is still closely connected to the perturbation expansion. The study concludes that the subseries in this case leads to an asymptotic expansion in the coupling constant.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
