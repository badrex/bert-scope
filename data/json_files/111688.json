They found that these hydrocarbons form a similar relation as amylene and paramylene. The author also discovered that heat's action on caoutchouc is the breakdown of a polymeric body into substances with a simple relation to the parent hydrocarbon. Lastly, they discussed the physical properties of isoprene and caoutchine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
