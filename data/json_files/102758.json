They discovered that the particles were not always oval, but could be round or shapeless due to the stretching of blood vessels. The author also found that the blood of a salmon contains more red particles, giving it a darker color. This research helped to further understand the structure and shape of blood cells in both fish and humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
