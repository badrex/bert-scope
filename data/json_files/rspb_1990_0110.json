They find that genetic variance continues to increase as population size grows, and the model predicts that the trait will appear to be under stabilizing selection due to extreme genotypes being less fit. This study highlights the importance of considering pleiotropy and its effects on genetic variation in quantitative traits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
