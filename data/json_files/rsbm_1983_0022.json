He is best known for his discovery of heavy hydrogen (deuterium) in 1931, for which he received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1934. Urey's work laid the foundation for modern isotope research and had a profound impact on the fields of nuclear physics, spectroscopy, and cosmochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Isotope research"}
