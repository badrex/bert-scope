They identified new terms in the copper ionized spectrum and tested Shenstone's allocation of terms. The study provides a better understanding of the atomic structure and properties of copper, contributing to the field of atomic physics and chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
