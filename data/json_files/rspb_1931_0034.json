They found that the limiting ratio of the protein to acid can be as high as 20 without a perceptible inflection. The constants deduced by Douglas and Atkin can be revised, and the ratio of the protein to acid is likely to be around 20. This study helps to understand the acid-base chemistry and electrophoresis of gelatin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
