He observes that the blood corpuscles in insects undergo similar changes and have analogous functions to those in vertebrates, suggesting that they are part of a broader biological process applicable to animals generally. Newport also describes the different forms of corpuscles in insects and their development stages, as well as their relation to the type of each particular class of animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
