They highlight issues such as distortion, residual stresses, defects, and the need for quality assurance testing. The author suggests that developing non-fusion welding processes, like friction welding and diffusion bonding, could help overcome these problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Welding Technology"}
