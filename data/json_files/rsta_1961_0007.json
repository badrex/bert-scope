They analyze the cases of closely superposed crystals without a vacuum layer and with a vacuum layer between them, as well as resolved lattice images. The intensity profiles of the images depend on crystal thicknesses and the vacuum layer, as well as deviations from the Brag angle. The study provides insights into the relation between moir\u00e9 patterns and crystal structure, with potential applications in structure analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
