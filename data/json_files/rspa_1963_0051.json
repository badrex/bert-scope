The formalism is reinterpreted as a non-interacting quantum field theory, and the indefinite metric appears as a Hermitian operator with eigenvalues. The invariant annihilation and creation field operators are found to retain a separate existence even when an interaction is introduced. The Hamiltonian form of the theory is developed, providing an immediate reformulation of the Lorentz covariant version of the Lee model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
