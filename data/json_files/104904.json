The author, James Parsons, describes experiments conducted by Mons. la Fosse, which showed the effectiveness of Lycoperdon in stopping blood flow in horses. The Royal Academy of Sciences also tested the remedy and found similar results. The article suggests that if Lycoperdon is as effective on human bodies, it could replace the current methods used for stopping blood flow after amputations.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Surgery"}
