The research uses a model simulation to understand how ocean circulation interacts with the solubility and biological pumps, creating features such as the large loss of CO2 from the tropics and gain in high latitudes. The study also quantifies the role of the biological pump in the uptake of anthropogenic carbon from the atmosphere and combines model results with observations to develop a carbon budget for the Atlantic Ocean.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
