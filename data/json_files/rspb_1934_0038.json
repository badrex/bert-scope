They explain how monochromatic irradiation can help avoid complicated secondary changes and provide a homogeneous excited state. The authors describe an apparatus for generating monochromatic light and its applications in photochemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
