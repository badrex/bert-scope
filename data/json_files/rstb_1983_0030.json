The authors argue that the differences between hexactinellids and other sponges, such as cellular vs. syncytial organization, warrant recognition of a primary subdivision at the subphylum level. They introduce two new subphyla: Symplasma, which includes Hexactinellida, and Cellularia, which includes other extant sponges."}
