They found that these films are stable on water surfaces due to the interaction between the polar groups and water molecules, and the long hydrocarbon chains keeping the molecules closely packed. The films' compressibility and cross-section measurements provide insights into the arrangement of molecules in the films and their interactions with the surrounding environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
