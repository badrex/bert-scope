These chemicals have caused harm to wintering geese and other wildlife. The withdrawal of dieldrin and the introduction of less persistent alternatives led to a reduction in environmental contamination, but new challenges arose with the side-effects of chlorfenvinphos and carbophenothion. The importance of critical surveillance and pre-clearance testing of new chemicals for potential hazards to the environment is emphasized.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Pollution and Conservation"}
