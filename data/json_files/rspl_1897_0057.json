They find that these enhanced lines are present in the spectra of hotter stars and the solar chromosphere. The study reveals that the chromosphere is a region of high temperature with a simplified spectrum compared to cooler regions where Fraunhofer absorption occurs.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
