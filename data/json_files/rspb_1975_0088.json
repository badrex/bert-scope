The cells' polarization sensitivity to polarized light is also different at these two peaks. This finding suggests that there are two separate visual pigments in different parts of the receptor, with one part twisted relative to the other. This discovery modifies the interpretation of previous work on fly photoreceptors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Visual System"}
