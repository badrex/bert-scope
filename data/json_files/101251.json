This blemish, a spungy excrescence, grows out of the edge of the eye's Uvea and can obstruct the pupil, causing poor vision or blindness. The cause of this blemish is not well understood, but it may be related to diet or feeding habits. Horses with this condition may stumble in bright sunlight but see better in dim light or darkness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Veterinary Medicine"}
