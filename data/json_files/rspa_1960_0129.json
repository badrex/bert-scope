They analyzed the elastic scattering distributions using an optical model and found that the 3He nucleus behaves similarly to alpha particles. The observed angular distributions confirm that the 3He nucleus has a short mean free path in nuclear matter, making the interaction mainly a surface effect. The authors also obtained interaction radii from the positions of maxima and minima in the scattering patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
