They demonstrate that the wave equation has a simple form in this context and that the paths of all particles, charged or uncharged, can be represented by the geodesics of the space. This discovery links the geometry to the particles used to demonstrate the theorems and has significant consequences for understanding the behavior of particles in electric fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
