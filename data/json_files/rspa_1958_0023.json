They apply this principle to two types of equilibrium situations: plasmas separated from the magnetic field by an interface and general axisymmetric systems. The energy principle technique provides a practical method for analyzing the stability of more complex equilibria than the normal mode method.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
