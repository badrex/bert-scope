They discovered that altering the hardness or the dimension ratio of the magnet can result in a zero temperature coefficient. The material's chemical and physical properties also play a role in achieving this. The study focused on iron and steel alloys, with results showing that hardened cast iron and certain hardened nickel steels have particularly small temperature coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
