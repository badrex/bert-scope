The authors, W. E. Parry and Henry Foster, studied the diurnal variation and intensity of the horizontal needle, as well as the dip of the magnetic needle at Woolwich and other stations within the Arctic Circle. They found that the needles experienced a significant diurnal change in direction, sometimes up to 5-7 degrees, and observed that these changes were not influenced by atmospheric phenomena like the aurora borealis or meteors.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
