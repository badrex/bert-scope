It investigates the aerodynamic forces and couples, as well as the effects of various disturbing factors such as wind and asymmetries of design and functioning. The paper provides solutions to the equations of motion under different assumptions and discusses the conditions necessary for stable rocket motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aerospace Engineering"}
