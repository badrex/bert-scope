The author focuses on the weak field case and derives a set of nonlinear equations to study the evolution of the hydromagnetic dynamo. Stable periodic dynamos are found to exist, and an interesting analytic solution is presented, which may be relevant to other problems related to finite-amplitude Benard convection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
