The authors study the exchange diffusion and equilibria in these crystals, examining their structures and properties. They find that ion exchange in crystals has unique advantages and interest as a study of a solid-state reaction closely dependent upon diffusion, allowing for more accurate experimentation and the collection of quantitative kinetic and equilibrium data.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
