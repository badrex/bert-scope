They discovered that blood consists of small globules, and plant sap contains tiny particles and pipes that may be responsible for their taste. The author also explains the difference in taste between salt and sugar, suggesting that the shape and size of their particles affect the taste sensation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Anatomy"}
