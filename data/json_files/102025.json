They argue that the Caecum helps in shaping and hardening the excrements before they pass through the Colon and Rectum. The author provides examples of various animals and their excrement shapes, suggesting a correlation between the size of the Caecum and the figure of the excrements. They also mention the possibility of further research on the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
