The author presents evidence that contradicts the general belief that X-rays cannot be reflected and suggests possible explanations for the observed reflection, such as the reflecting surface being rugged for the short wavelength of X-rays or due to phosphorescence or fluorescence in the mirror's substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
