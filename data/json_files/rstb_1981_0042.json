It highlights the importance of understanding nuclear instability for setting genetic purity standards and its potential applications in plant breeding. The author also presents examples of nuclear instability manipulation, such as genome elimination in Hordeum vulgar x H. bulbosum crosses and the production of haploid barley plants. The article emphasizes the need for further research to improve plant modification based on precise nuclear engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Breeding"}
