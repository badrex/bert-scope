The author suggests that the wave normal is scattered into the acceptance cone by spread-F irregularities. The article explores reflexion and coupling coefficients, and shows that for some angles of incidence, the signal is trapped in the waveguide. The range in the waveguide is computed as a function of the angle of incidence, and the properties of the waveguide modes are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
