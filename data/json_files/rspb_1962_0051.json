They found that the mean resting level of oxygen tension in the brain was 13 mm Hg, and it could be affected by various factors such as breathing, gas inhalation, and adrenaline injections. The study provides insights into understanding the oxygen levels in the brain and its relation to other organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
