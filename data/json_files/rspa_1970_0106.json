They observed additional absorption bands and compared the absorption spectra of the doped liquids with solid rare-gas crystals. The results suggest that Wannier-Mott exciton and impurity states can be experimentally observed in liquids, providing insights into the electronic states of disordered systems with large band gaps.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
