The authors discuss the node-on-node approach, the mapped-element approach, and the fictitious-node algorithm. They compare the features, merits, and drawbacks of each method and provide practical examples to demonstrate their accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Numerical Analysis and Modeling"}
