The authors found that the thermal conductivity of glasses varies with temperature in a similar way to the specific heat, while the conductivity of crystals is limited by 'Umklapp' processes, which cause thermal resistance. The results support the theories of Klemens and Peierls, explaining the temperature dependence of thermal conductivity in these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
