They found that after administering 6-OHDA, glial cells in the median frontal and superior buccal lobes showed degenerative changes, while no changes were observed in neuronal cells. This study provides insights into the specificity of 6-OHDA's action in an invertebrate model.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
