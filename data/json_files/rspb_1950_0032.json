It shows that antibodies prepared in rabbits are freely admitted to the foetal circulation, while antibodies prepared in cattle or horses are almost entirely excluded. The selectivity appears to be independent of the molecular dimensions of the antibody particles and depends on the species-specific origin of the antibody molecules. This research has implications for understanding passive anaphylactic sensitization in foetal development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
