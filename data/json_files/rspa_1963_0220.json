The author suggests that a random electromagnetic field must be present to maintain the distribution's stationarity. The study also discusses the limitations of classical statistical mechanics and the breakdown of the deterministic interpretation in the presence of a quadratic term in the potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
