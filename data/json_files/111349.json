The author compares the bones to those of other large extinct animals, particularly those of the Edentate order. The Scelidothere was a quadruped with a length of 8 to 10 feet, and it had long and strong claws, a long and muscular tongue, and was more closely related to sloths than to ant-eaters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
