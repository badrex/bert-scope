They discovered that for certain conditions, the critical instabilities are caused by non-axisymmetric, time-dependent disturbances. The study found that at least one of the non-axisymmetric families bifurcates subcritically, making neither family stable. This implies a finite transition corresponding to infinitesimal changes of the flow parameters in the vicinity of the Hopf bifurcation point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
