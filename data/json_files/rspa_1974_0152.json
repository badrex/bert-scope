The authors analyze an autonomous system of equations that describe these models using the perfect fluid approximation of Einstein's equations. They demonstrate that there are only three possible modes of behavior for a uniform universe, and discuss the implications of relaxing the energy condition, which may lead to singularity-free models.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
