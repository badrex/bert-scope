The study focuses on binary melts with high silica content, using equilibrium constants and ion fractions to calculate the distribution of silicate anions. The findings can help interpret the results of recent work on slag-metal equilibria and provide insights into the properties of liquid silicates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
