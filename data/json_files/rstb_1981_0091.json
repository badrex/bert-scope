Both elements play critical roles in post-translational modifications, with iron involved in hydroxylation and copper in crosslink formation. Nutritional deficiencies in these elements can lead to connective tissue pathology, affecting bones, lungs, and the cardiovascular system. The article highlights the biochemical and physiological consequences of trace element deficiencies and their interactions with other nutrients, such as ascorbic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
