They used deuterons of 9 MeV energy from the Cavendish cyclotron and determined the cross-sections for different reactions. The results provide insights into the mechanism of disintegrations caused by deuterons and contribute to the understanding of nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
