The authors explore the mechanisms behind nucleolar dominance, including the differences in chromatin structure and cytosine methylation between active and inactive loci. They also investigate the role of short, repeated sequences in the regulation of gene expression and the origins of genetic variation affecting ribosomal RNA gene expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
