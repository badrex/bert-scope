They found that the exchange approximation was not accurate at low electron energies, and included polarization effects to improve the accuracy of their calculations. The study provides phase shifts and zero-energy scattering lengths for both neon and argon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
