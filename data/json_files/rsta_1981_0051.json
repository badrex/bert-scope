The process involves passing hydrogen and carbon monoxide over iron catalysts at high temperatures and pressures. The fixed-bed system produces heavy hydrocarbons, while the fluid-bed system generates light motor fuels and oxygenates. The resulting products can be used as raw materials for various industries, including the petrochemical, paper, textile, and food industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
