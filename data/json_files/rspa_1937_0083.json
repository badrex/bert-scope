The authors used photographic techniques to capture the air flow and pressure around cones with varying apex angles. They found that the conical shock wave angle can be accurately calculated, and the wave becomes detached from the cone's apex when the conical regime is no longer possible. The findings provide valuable insights into the behavior of shock waves and high-speed flows around conical objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
