They found that the soils in the region are deeply weathered and leached, with low plant nutrient contents. The author also discovered that there is little evidence of a close relationship between soils and vegetation, except in soils derived from serpentine. The study provides valuable information for foresters, agriculturists, and scientists working in wet tropical areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
