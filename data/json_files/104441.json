He showed how he could improve the lifting power of natural loadstones and manipulate their polarity. He also presented the lifting capabilities of his artificial magnets, which were made of steel bars and iron. These experiments were conducted before the Royal Society in 1744.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
