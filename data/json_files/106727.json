Walker discovered that mixing sal ammoniac, nitre, and Glauber's salt could produce a greater degree of cold than when used separately. These experiments led to the freezing of water, spirits, and even mercury, with the potential for future applications in various scientific fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Temperature Control"}
