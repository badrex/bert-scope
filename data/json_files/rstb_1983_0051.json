The map is based on a classification of 487 releves, which recorded the numbers of each species of woody plant and the percentage cover of different ground layer vegetation types. Twenty-six vegetation types were mapped at a 1:25,000 scale, showing variations in structure and relationships with other vegetation types. The vegetation is species-rich and unique due to factors such as the presence of giant tortoises and the atoll's topography and climate. The study provides a basis for understanding the island's ecology and herbivore-plant interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
