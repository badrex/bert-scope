They develop a theoretical model that considers various types of flow, including laminar, extending, and compressive flow. The model allows for possible variations in density, temperature, and flow law with depth. The authors compare their theoretical results with experimental data from a borehole experiment on the Jungfraufirn glacier, providing insights into the behavior of ice masses and the effect of glacier sides on their motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
