They compared the energy distribution of disintegration electrons with the heating effect of the -rays, finding that the energy of disintegration varies from atom to atom. This result challenges the idea that the energy of disintegration is a characteristic constant of the atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
