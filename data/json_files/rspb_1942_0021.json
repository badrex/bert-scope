They highlight the limitations of previous methods and the need for improvements in analysis. The author also critiques the frequency hypothesis, which suggests a regular distribution of amino-acids in proteins, due to the potential errors in amino-acid estimations. The author's own research aims to isolate and analyze amino-acids in proteins more accurately, in order to better understand protein structure and composition."}
