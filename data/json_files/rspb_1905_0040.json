The study compares their effects on blood pressure, pulse, and respiration in anesthetized animals, finding similarities with the effects of aconitine from European aconite. The authors also explore the antidotal effects of atropine on indaconitine and discuss the lethal doses of these alkaloids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alkaloids and Natural Products"}
