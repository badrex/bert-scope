The authors use lubrication theory and elastostatic equations to model the internal flow and pressure distribution. They find self-similar solutions for the cavity's shape and pressure distribution, which depend on a single parameter, the stress-intensity factor at the tip. The study provides insights into oil recovery techniques and magma flow in the Earth's mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
