The author explores the role of crystal defects and lattice imperfections in the decomposition process and the critical temperatures at which these processes occur. The article also examines the mechanisms of detonation in various solid explosives, such as nitrogen iodide, lead azide, and barium azide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
