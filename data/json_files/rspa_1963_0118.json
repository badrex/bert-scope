The authors investigate the thermal motions of the atoms in these materials between room temperature and 1100\u00b0C. They find that the value of the thermal parameter 9 is uncertain at low temperatures but can be determined accurately above a certain threshold. The results provide evidence for the composition and structure of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
