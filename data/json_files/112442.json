The author finds that the reaction is in accordance with the formula Codeia, and that apocodeia has similar properties to apomorphia, a base derived from morphia. The research also suggests that there may be an intermediate reaction involving apocodeia or morphia.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
