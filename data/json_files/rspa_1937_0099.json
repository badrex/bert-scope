They found that the entropy difference increases continuously with decreasing temperature and passes through a maximum at about half the transition temperature. This research provides insights into the thermodynamical properties of supraconductivity and the electronic entropy in the normal state of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
