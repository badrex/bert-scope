The study focuses on the case where the circulation is zero and the speed at large distances from the cylinder is subsonic. The author uses the hodograph method and provides an asymptotic solution for the flow, which can be useful for understanding the behavior of compressible fluids in aerodynamics and other applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
