They propose a matrix of instantaneous hardening moduli that relate the rate of hardening on each slip system to all slip-rates, based on observations and experiments. The study presents simulations of various behaviors in single crystals (copper) that agree with observations, including stress-strain curves, hardening rate variations, latent hardening, tensile overshoot, and secondary slips. The research provides an analytical form for the evolution of the instantaneous slip-system hardening moduli, which can help predict the complex hardening behaviors of single crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Crystallography"}
