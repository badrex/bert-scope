He discovers that these fringes contain a unique arrangement of blood vessels and a specific type of epithelium, suggesting that their primary function is to secrete synovia. This finding challenges the common belief that these fringes only serve a mechanical purpose in filling joint spaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
