T. Glazebrook, developed a method to create a standard of mutual inductance using a single-layer primary coil and a many-layered secondary coil. They investigated various designs and conditions to ensure the standard was accurately calculable, permanent, and sensitive enough for comparison methods. The design was tested and found to be effective, with potential applications in other problems requiring accurate mutual inductance measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
