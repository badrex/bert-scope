The authors propose an energy parameter for cavitation erosion and describe methods for testing the resistance of materials to erosion. They find that erosion volume is proportional to flow velocity to the fifth power and to the characteristic model dimension to the third power, which can help engineers predict cavitation damage in prototypes based on model tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
