He finds that a lunar diurnal variation in magnetic declination exists at each station, with a double progression in a lunar day. The study reveals disparities between the amounts of easterly and westerly extreme elongations at each location and provides information on the times and magnitudes of these variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
