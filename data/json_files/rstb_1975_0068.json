It explores the differences in uptake and storage of major nutrients and trace elements, as well as the importance of flexibility in selectivity. The article also highlights the role of metal-ligand stability constants in transfer and carrier properties, and the potential for foreign metals to cause poisoning by binding irreversibly to recognition sites.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Coordination Chemistry"}
