The papers discuss monochromatic vision, electrical conductivity in gases traversed by cathode rays, the effects of temperature on bacteria, and the thermo-electric qualities of metals under strain. These papers were communicated by notable scientists such as Professor J. J. Thomson, Professor Ramsay, Lord Lister, and Lord Kelvin.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
