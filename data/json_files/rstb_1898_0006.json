They describe the overlapping arrangement of coccoliths in coccospheres, which provides a protective armor, and the structure of rhabdoliths in rhabdospheres. The authors also discuss the challenges in collecting and preserving these organisms and propose a new species, Coccosphera leptopora, based on their observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
