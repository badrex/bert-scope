The Fourier-ratio method is applicable to inner-shell edges, while the Fourier-log method can be applied to any energy-loss spectrum. These techniques enhance the quality of plasmon and core-loss spectra, making it possible to obtain reproducible results from thicker samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
