They used special apparatus and techniques to collect and analyze the gases, finding that the helium spectrum increased in brilliancy when cooled. The research helped to understand the connection between helium, uranium, and thorium and their radioactivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radioactivity"}
