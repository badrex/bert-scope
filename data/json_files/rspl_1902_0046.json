The researchers found that when a single crystal of lead is strained, it undergoes recrystallization, forming new orientations and patches of twin crystals. The process is more pronounced when the strain is severe or when the specimen is heated. The study provides insights into the behavior of materials under stress and the mechanisms of recrystallization.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
