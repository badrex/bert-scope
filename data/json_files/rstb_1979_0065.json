The authors assess the effects of control measures on the overall Desert Locust situation and consider the natural dynamics of locust populations. They provide evidence from two situations in which valid and comprehensive estimates of locust numbers and swarms were possible, allowing for a comparison of control operations' effectiveness.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Population Dynamics"}
