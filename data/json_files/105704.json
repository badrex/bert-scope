The author, James Stirling, described the incident in a letter, detailing the darkness, the appearance of the sun, and the air's yellowish-green color. The event was accompanied by a strong sulfurous smell and a rain that left a black residue on clean paper. Stirling suggested that the cause might have been a volcanic eruption or subterranean fire releasing sulfur into the air. Various other conjectures were made, including the possibility of the plague or the burning of woods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
