They find that Strain A has posterior nuclear forms and \"short stumpy\" forms, while Strains B and C are more similar to each other and have longer free flagellated forms. The authors reconsider the nomenclature of the parasites and suggest that Strain A may correspond to the type to which the name T. equiperdum was given.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
