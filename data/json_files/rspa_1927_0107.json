They found the wavelength to be 5577, confirming the oxygen green line as the origin of the famous auroral spectrum line. This discovery indicates that oxygen, along with nitrogen, is present in the upper atmosphere where auroral light is emitted.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
