The authors study the effects of finite length and radius ratio on the stability of anomalous modes, which are cellular flows that contradict the belief of radial flow towards the inner cylinder due to the Ekman boundary layer. They use computational and experimental methods to analyze the lower stability limits of anomalous modes and their relationship with Reynolds numbers. The findings provide insights into the organization of dynamical behavior in the Taylor-Couette system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
