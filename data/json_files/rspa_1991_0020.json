They develop a model that combines the kinetics of thermal degradation of the polymer with a numerical model for the unsteady-state diffusion of degradation products in the polymer. This allows them to explore the influence of material, geometric, and process variables to optimize the removal process.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Ceramic Materials"}
