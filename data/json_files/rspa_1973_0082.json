They found that when using a steel indenter, the apparent fracture strength of the material increases by about 50% compared to using a glass indenter. This increase is due to frictional forces at the interface between the indenter and the material, which modify the Hertz distribution of contact stress. The authors also discuss the implications of these findings for understanding Hertzian fracture and the role of friction in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
