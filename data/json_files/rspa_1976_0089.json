A simple model is adopted for the disturbed region, and the phase integral method is used to calculate the transferred modulation. The results show that the greatest modulation is transferred when the wanted wave is reflected near the most disturbed part of the ionosphere, and the relation to observed effects near sunrise is discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
