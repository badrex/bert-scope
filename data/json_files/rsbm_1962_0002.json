His research on bacteriolysis and the role of antibodies and complement in the immune response led to a better understanding of the mechanisms behind immunity and the development of vaccines. Bordet's work also helped differentiate between related bacterial species and paved the way for further advancements in the study of infectious diseases and the immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
