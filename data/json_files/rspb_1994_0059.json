Researchers found that female guppies tend to prefer males with more orange coloration. By imposing artificial selection for increased and decreased amounts of orange in male guppies, the study demonstrates a possible genetic correlation between female mating preference and male color patterns, which could contribute to the variation in color patterns and female preferences across guppy populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
