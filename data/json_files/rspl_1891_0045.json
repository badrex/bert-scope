The method allows for accurate measurements of insulation resistance and can be used for various types of materials and circuits. This technique is useful for determining the insulating quality of small samples of materials, the insulation resistance of short pieces of cable, and other very high resistances.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
