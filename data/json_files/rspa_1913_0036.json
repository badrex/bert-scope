They explore three main relations: isomorphism, morphotropy, and enantiomorphism. The study focuses on aliphatic hydrocarbons, and the results are presented in this paper, with further findings on halogen and nitro derivatives of methane to be discussed in a future communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
