The authors discuss the ability of current aspherical models to explain the observed seismic data and attempt to catalog the features of the Earth's structure that are well-constrained by low-frequency data. They also consider the effect of short-wavelength structure on low-frequency data and the importance of accurate theoretical approximations in modeling the observed signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
