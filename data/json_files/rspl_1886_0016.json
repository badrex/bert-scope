The research also explores the relationship between cranial nerves and the mucous canals of the head, as well as the development of the olfactory organ and ear. The findings suggest that cranial nerves are derived from the original outgrowths from the brain, rather than from the external epiblast, as previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
