They found that these cells are also known as plasma cells, Langer's bladders, and are similar to lacunae described by other researchers. The presence of glycogen in these cells could have implications for understanding the physiology and anatomy of mollusks and other invertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
