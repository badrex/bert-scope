This reaction produces a ferrous product without ferric oxidation and allows for the preparation of double selenates by adding a solution of alkali selenate. The author also studied the reduction of selenic acid by nascent hydrogen and hydrogen sulfide, revealing new chemical facts and difficulties in preparing the iron group of double selenates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
