They found that Holocephali have a unique attachment of the pterygo-quadrate to the braincase and a complete otic process. Their research suggests that Holocephali represent the most primitive living Gnathostomes known and have important implications for understanding the evolution of fish skulls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate morphology"}
