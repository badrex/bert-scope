The author derives expressions for the Bondi mass and mass flux by employing an arbitrary Newman-Penrose null tetrad in the conformally related spacetime. A numerical tool is developed to relate the near field of a gravitationally radiating system to the far field, allowing for the calculation of the system's mass and energy loss.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
