He describes the physical characteristics of the deer and its horns, as well as the process of growth and shedding. Molyneux also compares the deer's horn growth to the growth of vegetables and the dropping of fruit from trees, suggesting a similar mechanism in both processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
