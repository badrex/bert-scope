Kolmogorov's research on the understanding of turbulent combustion. It discusses recent advances in the field, focusing on the thin laminar flamelet regime, where chemical timescales are smaller than the smallest turbulence timescale. The paper presents a theoretical model that accounts for the effects of chemical reaction rate mechanisms and molecular transport processes on the mean reaction rate in turbulent flames. The model is compared with experimental data and direct numerical simulations, providing insights into the flame stretch factor and the flamelet surface area. The paper concludes by identifying unresolved problems and future directions in the field of turbulent combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Combustion and Flame"}
