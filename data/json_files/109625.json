The shells were found protruding from the mud and were of various shapes and sizes. The author, J. Griffiths, initially thought they were a new genus but later found similar shells described by Rumphius. The shells' unique features include their great length, size, and division in the upper part.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Malacology"}
