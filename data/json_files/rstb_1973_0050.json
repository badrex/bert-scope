It shows that primitive erythroid cells are replaced by definitive erythroid cells as the embryo develops. The switch from primitive to definitive erythropoiesis is associated with the synthesis of new haemoglobins, including haemoglobin H, which is not found in adult chickens. The research provides insights into the regulation of cell populations and differentiation in developing organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
