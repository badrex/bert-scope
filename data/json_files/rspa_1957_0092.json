The author introduces scalar and vector potentials, Hertzian potentials, and gauge transformations to describe the electromagnetic field and its sources. The study provides a foundation for understanding how electromagnetic fields behave in various media and offers insights into potential applications in material science and engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
