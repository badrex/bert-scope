The authors analyze the forces transmitted by hip and knee joints during various activities, such as walking, ramp and stair ascent and descent. They also review previous research on joint forces and present their analysis methods, which involve using dynamometers and cine-camera recordings. The study aims to provide insights into the design and functionality of endoprostheses for arthritic patients.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Biomechanics and Prosthetics"}
