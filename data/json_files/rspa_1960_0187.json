The findings show that these simple theories provide satisfactory predictions for bond lengths in aromatic molecules, such as -dibenzacridine and chrysene. The success of these theories is attributed to a correlation between their respective bond orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
