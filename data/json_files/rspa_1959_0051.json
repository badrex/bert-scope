They analyzed the experimental results to obtain properties of an effective harmonic frequency spectrum of magnesium oxide, including several negative and positive moments and coefficients of the low-frequency expansion. The zero-point energy was found to be 3455 cal/mole and causes anharmonic effects even at the lowest temperatures. The results were compared with the heat capacities and elastic constants of alkali halides, suggesting similar interatomic forces in magnesium oxide and lithium fluoride.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
