The discussion covered various theories, including the diapyrie theory of the mountain's formation. The biologists and geologists agreed that further investigation of older interior mountains in Borneo is necessary for a better understanding of the region's flora and fauna. The expedition also left behind an aluminum portable hut named \"Burlington House\" for future ecological studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mountain Formation"}
