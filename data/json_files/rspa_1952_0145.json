They found that the training process affects the bulk of the population rather than selecting exceptional mutants. The study also showed that the growth rates of haploid strains derived from the same diploid parent were similar, but the initial values varied widely.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
