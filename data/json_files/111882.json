The author, Edward Sabine, presents four determinations of the dip made at different times and analyzes the data to understand the secular change in the Earth's magnetic field. The results show a decrease in the dip over the years, which is important for understanding the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field and its impact on navigation and other applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
