They discovered that annealing iron significantly reduces the maximum elongation caused by magnetisation, and that rings exhibit different behavior than straight wires. This research sheds light on the relationship between annealing, magnetisation, and dimensional changes in iron materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
