The researchers determined the coefficient of viscosity of air and its variation with temperature, as well as the critical velocity for air flow in the pipe. They also found that the resistance in turbulent motion is independent of air pressure and proportional to the pipe's length and the square of the air's velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
