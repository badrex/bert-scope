The authors propose using a rotating sector and two beams of light to measure the rate of polymerization and the mean lifetime of the active molecules. They apply this method to the photo-polymerization of methyl acrylate and compare it to the interaction of hydrogen atoms, providing a complementary means of determining lifetimes of short-lived activated molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
