The researchers discovered that oscillations in intracellular calcium concentration are linked to oscillations in sodium current. This phenomenon is observed in cultured human sweat-gland epithelia and is thought to result from an increase in intracellular calcium, which activates calcium-sensitive potassium channels, increasing the electrochemical gradient for sodium entry. The study shows that epithelial cells behave in synchrony to induce changes in sodium current.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
