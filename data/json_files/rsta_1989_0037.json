This helps us understand mantle convection, plate tectonics, and other geological processes. The study of seismic anomalies provides constraints on the modeling of mantle convection and the viscosity distribution in the Earth's mantle, as well as insights into petrology, geochemistry, geomagnetism, gravity, and mineral physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
