The treatments provide compact expressions for temperature-position profiles, central temperature-excesses, and surface temperature-gradients, allowing for the correction of rate-constant, reaction order, and Arrhenius activation energy errors. The methods can be applied to exothermic and endothermic reactions and are based on different approximations to the Arrhenius rate law."}
