The author presents a detailed stability analysis for water waves and demonstrates that these wavetrains are unstable when the fundamental wavenumber satisfies a certain condition. The practical implications of this instability are demonstrated through experiments, showing that wavetrains can develop irregularities and eventually disintegrate over great distances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
