It examines the impact of chronometric dating on the debate between the'regional continuity' and 'rapid replacement' models. The author argues that new dates for fossils and archaeological sites in western Asia have led to major chronological revisions and renewed discussion of cultural-archaeological implications. The Levant region played a crucial role in the movement of humans and animals and as a refugium during harsh climatic periods. The author suggests that understanding behavioral patterns and changes during the past 200,000 years can help explain the emergence of modern cultures in the Upper Palaeolithic period.", "scientific_discipline": "Anthropology > Human Evolution"}
