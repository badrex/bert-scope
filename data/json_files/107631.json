Wollaston, examines small metallic cubes found in ironworks slag and identifies them as titanium in its metallic state. He describes the properties of metallic titanium, including its infusibility, resistance to chemical reactions, and ability to conduct electricity. Wollaston also discusses the possible formation of these metallic crystals and their potential implications for understanding other metallic crystals in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
