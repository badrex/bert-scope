The author explores different types of oscillations, including longitudinal waves and the influence of temperature on atmospheric oscillations. The study also examines the connection between the semi-diurnal variation of the barometer and the oscillations of the Earth's atmosphere as a whole.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
