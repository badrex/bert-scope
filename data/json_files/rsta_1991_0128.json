It compares the effectiveness of local and global prior distributions in modeling and analyzing the images. The study finds that using global prior information can improve the accuracy of lesion localization and provide more complete inferential statements about the images.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Imaging"}
