It explains that penicillins and cephalosporins target the transpeptidation reaction, which is the final step in cell wall synthesis. The authors describe the structure of bacterial cell walls, the role of transpeptidase in cross-linking, and the mechanism of action of penicillin on the transpeptidase enzyme.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
