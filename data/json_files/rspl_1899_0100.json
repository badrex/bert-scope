The authors present evidence from various expeditions and studies, concluding that scurvy is a result of eating tainted food, specifically ptomaines found in preserved meats and fish. They argue that lime juice and fresh vegetables do not prevent or cure scurvy, and that proper food preservation is essential for maintaining good health.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Nutrition and Dietetics"}
