The technique uses a magnetic field to modulate radiation emitted or absorbed by the gas, providing high sensitivity and selectivity in detecting nitric oxide. The performance of the laboratory instrument is compared with theoretical predictions, showing its potential for observing nitric oxide in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
