The researchers found that certain morph frequencies, such as unbanded and yellow, are favored in extreme climatic conditions, with cold air and low temperatures promoting these morphs at higher altitudes. In contrast, warmer and drier conditions seem to favor unbanded and yellow morphs at lower altitudes. The results suggest that climate can act as a selective agent in the distribution of morph frequencies in Cepaea nemoralis populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
