The author analyzes data from three stations (Greenwich, Dublin, and Makerstoun) over eight years to determine the annual variations in barometric pressure and the impact of these variations on weather patterns. The study finds that the greatest pressures occur from May to September, while the least occur in October and November.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
