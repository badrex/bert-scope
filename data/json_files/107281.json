They discovered that the spleen plays a crucial role in separating and absorbing fluids and partially digested food from the stomach, preventing them from mixing with the chyle. The spleen contains cells that hold a watery fluid, which is released when the spleen is distended, and it is connected to the cardiac portion of the stomach through lymphatic vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
