They argue that the bone commonly regarded as the os pubis in crocodiles is actually a pre-pubic bone, and that the true pubic bone is found in the anterior process of the ischium. This study contributes to the understanding of the evolution and development of the pelvic girdle in reptiles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate anatomy"}
