He challenges the idea that the iris and the crystalline lens are solely responsible for this ability and suggests that the external muscles of the eye may also play a role. The author also examines the structure of the crystalline lens and its layers, questioning the existence of muscles within the lens.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Eye Anatomy"}
