The research confirms that these two species are the only native flowering plants in the area and are confined to the Antarctic Peninsula-Scotia Ridge sector. The findings show a high degree of vegetative uniformity in both species, with variations in plant size and vigor. The study also highlights the importance of temperature and daylength in regulating the growth and reproduction of these plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
