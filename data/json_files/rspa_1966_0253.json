They identified several separate sheets of the Fermi surface and compared their dimensions with a predicted Fermi surface based on the band structure of rhodium. The study explains the observed frequencies and provides insights into the behavior of transverse magnetoresistance in rhodium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
