They found that spicule production depends on factors like location in the sponge body and illumination, while the calcification rate by spicule-forming cells remains constant. Different mechanisms are involved in the growth of various spicule types, such as triradiate and monaxon spicules. The study provides insights into the biomineralization processes of calcareous sponges and their unique skeletal connective tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
