The author highlights the importance of artificial respiration and oxygen inhalation in maintaining ventilation during hypoxic incidents and the impact of chemoreceptor activity on pulmonary ventilation. The findings have practical implications for mountaineering and the use of oxygen equipment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
