They discovered that lead tetraethyl works by reacting with oxygenated intermediates, forming lead oxide, which removes sources of auto-ignition and reduces the propagating mechanisms leading to detonation and knock. This reaction also promotes the reduction of lead monoxide to atomic lead.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
