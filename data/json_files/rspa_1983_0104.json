They accurately calibrated the positions of fifty-one transitions in both P and R branches and analyzed the spectrum to determine molecular constants and equilibrium parameters. This study provides valuable information about the structure and properties of the NF radical, which is isoelectronic with O2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
