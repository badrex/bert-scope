They found that starch does not significantly increase carbon dioxide production, while other foods containing starch, such as sugar and gluten, act as powerful and enduring respiratory stimulants. The study also showed that certain foods, like tea, can cause weight loss.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
