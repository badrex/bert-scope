It covers topics such as linear multistep methods, extrapolation procedures, and deferred corrections. The author presents various techniques for increasing the rate of convergence and improving the accuracy of finite-difference approximations to elliptic problems with smooth solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
