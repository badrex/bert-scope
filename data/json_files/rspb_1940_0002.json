The experiments show that these extracts can cause significant damage to the islets, leading to a permanently diabetic condition. The researchers also observe changes in the duct epithelium and the acinar tissue of the pancreas. The findings contribute to the understanding of diabetes and its potential treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
