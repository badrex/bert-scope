The composite, made of aluminum-magnesium-silicon alloy and continuous alumina-based fibers, shows strong fiber-matrix bonding and mechanical properties that match the rule of mixtures predictions. The research also explores the effects of fiber orientation, heat treatment, and anisotropic residual stresses on the composite's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
