The authors found that winds in the D and E regions can be approximated by Fourier series, with prevailing winds and periodic components undergoing seasonal and geographical variations. The study also highlights the similarities in wind patterns between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
