They found that the critical value for laminar flow in rectangular pipes is in the same region as that for circular pipes. The study also showed that the square cross-section provides the maximum flow for a given pressure difference among rectangular sections.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Mechanics"}
