They discuss the theoretical and experimental aspects of titration, including the determination of dissociation constants and the estimation of amino-acids and polypeptides. The study provides a comprehensive method for the identification and quantification of these compounds, which is essential for understanding protein chemistry and analytical chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
