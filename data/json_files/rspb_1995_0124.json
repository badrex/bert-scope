Contrary to the popular belief that symmetrical faces are more attractive, the research found that making faces more symmetrical actually made them less attractive. The results suggest that fluctuating asymmetry plays a relatively minor role in assessments of facial beauty compared to directional asymmetry. The observed positive relationship between asymmetry and facial attractiveness may be due to certain facial features, including those contributing to attractiveness, showing directional asymmetry or antisymmetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Psychology"}
