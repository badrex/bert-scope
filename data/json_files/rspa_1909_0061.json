He discovered the birefringence developed in glass and other insulators when placed in an intense electric field and the change produced in polarized light by its reflection from the polished pole of a magnet, known as the Kerr effect. His work has had a lasting impact on the study of magneto-optic phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
