The authors show that the order-parameter R and the reciprocal activity can be expressed in terms of hauptmoduls associated with certain congruence subgroups of the full modular group. They derive various closed-form expressions and hypergeometric formulas for the order-parameter and analyze the properties of the model in the ordered and disordered regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
