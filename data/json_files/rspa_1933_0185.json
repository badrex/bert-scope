They found that the coefficient was 0.07 at 295K and analyzed the effect of repulsive and attractive forces between gas atoms and the solid surface. The results provide insights into the behavior of gas atoms and the potential energy between them and solid surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
