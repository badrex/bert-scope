They found a very fast component with a relaxation time constant of around 100 microseconds and a charge transfer of about 1. The main part of the current relaxed more slowly, with a time constant similar to the inactivation of sodium channels. The study provides valuable information about the kinetics of the steps that precede and follow the normal opening of the channel.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
