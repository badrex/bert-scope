They observed the relative number and energy spectrum of cosmic-ray particles with energies below a certain threshold. The results provided insights into the nature of mesotrons and the detection of radiations from radioactive substances. This research contributed to the understanding of cosmic rays and their interactions with matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
