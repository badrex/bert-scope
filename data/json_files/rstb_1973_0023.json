The authors found that thick filaments are more stable when muscles are pre-cooled before fixation. They also observed ion exchange in the tissue during fixation, with the exchange being most rapid when fixation takes place at 37\u00b0C. The study provides insights into the preservation and analysis of smooth muscle structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
