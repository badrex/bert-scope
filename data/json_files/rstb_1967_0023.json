The authors explore topics such as temperature fluctuations, seed viability, and the role of birds in plant dispersal. They also discuss the importance of understanding the unique microenvironments in which these plants thrive and the potential for further research to improve our understanding of these ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
