They improved the accuracy of measurement by refining the determination of accelerating voltage and using different materials. The results showed that crystal parameters are independent of crystal size to within about 1 part in for crystals larger than a few hundred angstroms. The findings are consistent with previous data and demonstrate the reliability of the electron diffraction method for measuring atomic constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
