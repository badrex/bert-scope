The author examines the complex spectrum, which includes lines of carbon monoxide, manganese, and iron, as well as the alkali metals sodium, potassium, and lithium. The study provides a detailed analysis of the spectrum's constitution during different stages of the \"blow\" and explains the factors affecting its appearance and disappearance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
