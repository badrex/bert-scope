The author suggests that the boy's diet, which included sand mixed with sand eels, and a head injury may have contributed to the formation and passing of these stones. The case study also includes other examples of individuals who experienced similar stone passing and recovery.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Urology"}
