Despite living in a dark environment, these harvestmen have retained their eyes, which are sensitive to a range of light intensities and have a unique structure. The research provides insights into the adaptation and survival of these creatures in the cave ecosystem.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
