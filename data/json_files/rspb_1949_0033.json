They discover that there is an abrupt change of state, with the contractile component suddenly becoming capable of bearing a load equal to the maximum tension set up in an isometric tetanus. The study provides insights into the mechanical properties of striated muscle and the process of muscle fiber activation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
