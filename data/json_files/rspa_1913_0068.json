They analyze the deformation of volume elements, the behavior of particles near solid boundaries, and the streamlines of the liquid. The study provides insights into the limitations of the hydrodynamic treatment of liquids and the importance of molecular structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
