They discuss the different stages of this process, from the preservation of original texture to the complete destruction of organic arrangement. The author also analyzes a unique schistus found in Iceland, which provides insight into the early stages of carbonization. This research contributes to the understanding of the formation of fossil fuels and the history of geology.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Geochemistry"}
