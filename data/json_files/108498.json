{"article_id": "108498", "revised_title": "Understanding Osmotic Force and Osmosis", "semantic_tags": ["Osmosis", "Osmotic force", "Diffusion", "Membrane filtration", "Biological processes"], "tldr": "The author, Thomas Graham, explains the concept of osmotic force and osmose, which is the flow of water through a porous membrane due to a difference in solute concentration. He discusses experiments and theories related to osmose and its potential impact on the natural world. Graham also explores the role of diffusion in osmose and the limitations of previous explanations, such as capillarity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and thermodynamics"}
