Larmor discusses the influence of a magnetic field on radiation frequency and how it affects the behavior of oscillating and revolving electrified particles in a magnetic field. He explains the experiments of Dr. Zeeman, which verify deductions made by Lorentz from this view. Larmor also explores the connection between the Faraday effect and the electric character of molecules, as well as the role of revolving electrons in the behavior of material molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
