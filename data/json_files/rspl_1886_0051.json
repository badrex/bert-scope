They describe the cells as consisting of a network containing hyaline substance and granules, which are involved in the secretion process. The author also discusses the reactions of these granules and the role of the hyaline substance in producing mucin. They argue against the idea of cell disintegration during secretion and propose that the cells grow and secrete simultaneously.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
