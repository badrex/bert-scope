The authors found that the dominant spectral features are assigned to associatively chemisorbed ethylene, and upon hydrogenation, most of the chemisorbed surface species were converted to gaseous ethane. The results provide insights into the mechanism of ethylene hydrogenation on these catalysts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
