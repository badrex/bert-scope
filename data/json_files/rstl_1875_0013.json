The author analyzes the data collected by Admiral Sir Leopold Lintocic and provides insights into the tidal patterns, including the maximum and minimum values of the apparent Solitidal Interval and the influence of the Sun and Moon on the tides. The study helps to understand the complex dynamics of Arctic tides and their relationship with the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
