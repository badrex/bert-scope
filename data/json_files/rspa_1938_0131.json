They found that the CH2 group in various organic compounds exhibited multiple absorption bands due to interactions with other molecules, particularly benzene rings. The study provided insights into the behavior of CH2 groups in different compounds and helped to understand the persistence of certain frequencies in their infra-red spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
