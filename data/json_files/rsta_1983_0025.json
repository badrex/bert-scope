It describes two distinct structural types: columnar and nematic. The columnar phase consists of discs stacked aperiodically in columns, while the nematic phase is an orientationally ordered arrangement of discs without long-range translational order. The article also presents a theoretical model for the phase transitions between these phases and the isotropic phase, which can help explain the behavior of these new liquid crystal systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
