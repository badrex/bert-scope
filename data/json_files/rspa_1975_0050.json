They analyzed bands involving three vibronic levels and found a new value for the Renner parameter, resolving discrepancies in earlier electron resonance results. This work provides a more accurate understanding of the Renner-Teller effect in linear molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular physics"}
