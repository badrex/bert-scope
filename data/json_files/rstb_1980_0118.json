It discusses the concept of soft phonons and their role in instabilities within periodic crystalline structures. The article also explores the behavior of charge density waves and phonon softening in quasi-one-dimensional and quasi-two-dimensional metals, as well as in insulators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
