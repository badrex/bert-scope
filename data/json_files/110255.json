The filtered water would be conducted into a well and distributed to the houses using existing mains and branches. The filtering chamber would be built using brickwork, cement, and granite blocks, with a depth of eight feet and four feet below low-water mark.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Water Supply and Treatment"}
