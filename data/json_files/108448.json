They discovered that Wart-Hogs have a unique tooth development process, with some teeth being replaced by premolars, and the first true molar showing precocious growth. This research provides insight into the dentition of Wart-Hogs and contributes to the understanding of mammalian tooth development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
