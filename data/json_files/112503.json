The author, George Biddell Airy, discusses the establishment of the wires and apparatus used for this study and presents the theory and numerical expressions for inferring magnetic forces from galvanic currents. The author also examines the agreement and discordances between the curves of magnetic forces obtained from magnetometers and galvanometers, suggesting possible reasons for these discrepancies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
