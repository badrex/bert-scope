The authors found that the conductivity-temperature curves can be represented by a formula that accounts for concentration, ionization, and ionic mobility. They also discovered that the intrinsic conductivity of the solution reaches a minimum at a certain concentration and then increases. The study provides insights into the behavior of electrolytes in solutions and the influence of temperature on their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
