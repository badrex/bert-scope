They found that myosin is insoluble between its isoelectric point and pH 5.6, but its solubility increases with higher pH levels and salt concentrations. This research helps explain the changes in muscle structure during processes like rigor mortis and muscle contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
