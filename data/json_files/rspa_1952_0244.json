They consider the critical load required to level irregularities and the importance of understanding the difference between permanent and temporary (elastic) levelling. The authors also explore the potential for elastic deformation to affect the permissible minimum film thickness in hydrodynamic lubrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
