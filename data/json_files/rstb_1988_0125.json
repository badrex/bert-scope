The thick Red/Norwich Crag sequence is found in a deep, sharply bounded basin, likely due to erosion rather than tectonic activity. The study uses various methods, including lithostratigraphy, biostratigraphy, and chronostratigraphy, to identify and correlate the different units within the Crag deposits. The findings contribute to the understanding of the British Pleistocene stage system and the evolution of the region's geological history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
