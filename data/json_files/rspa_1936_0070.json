They extended energy measurements to higher energies using a strong magnetic field and analyzed the curvature of particle tracks to determine the energy spectrum of cosmic rays. Their work improved the understanding of cosmic rays and their interactions with Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
