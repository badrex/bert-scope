The research reveals the system's adaptations for maintaining low Mg2+ and Ca2+ concentrations in blood and ovarian fluid, as well as its water resorptive function. The findings contribute to understanding the reproductive strategy and osmotic relations of the lumpsucker fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Reproductive Biology"}
