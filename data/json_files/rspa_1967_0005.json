They found that the velocity of deposition of particles to the surface is determined by the rate of eddy diffusion in the turbulent boundary layer above the surface. The study also showed that surface texture and stickiness play a crucial role in the deposition process, with stickiness being more important for particles of about 10 diameter upwards.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
