They observed the resonances of exchangeable and non-exchangeable hydrogens, and found that the structures of the active sites of both lysozymes were very similar to each other and their crystal structures. This study revealed an interesting interaction between the residues tryptophan 108 and glutamic acid 35 in lysozyme.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
