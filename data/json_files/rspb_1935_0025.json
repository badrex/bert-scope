They found that while anterior pituitary extracts could delay testis atrophy, they were unable to maintain spermatogenesis or prevent comb shrinkage. Additionally, thyroxine treatment failed to prevent plumage changes in hypophysectomized birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
