They introduce a loading function and a fracture surface in deformation space to distinguish between loading, unloading, and reloading. The theory is based on the assumption of path independence in the small, leading to a flow rule for the fracture stress decrement and expressions for the changes in moduli accompanying a change in deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
