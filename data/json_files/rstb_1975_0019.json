They discovered that the optical birefringence spike reaches its maximum before the action potential and drops to the baseline earlier than the action potential. This suggests that the optical spike is related to the change in membrane potential. The axon fluorescence produced by staining with merocyanine is linearly dependent on the membrane potential, offering a new way to study the structural mechanism of excitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
