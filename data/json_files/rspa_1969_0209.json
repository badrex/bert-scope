They found that the rate of ionization is considerably increased by admixing neutral molecules of electronically excited nitrogen. The electric strength of nitrogen at low pressure decreases as the population of excited molecules increases. The study provides insights into the spatial distribution, active life, and de-activation mechanisms of excited nitrogen molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
