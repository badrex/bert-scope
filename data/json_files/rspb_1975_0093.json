They explain how the pollen wall stores physiologically active substances that play a crucial part in the interaction with the stigma and the regulation of the breeding system. The intricate structure of the sculptured layer of the exine and the different layers of the pollen wall contribute to adaptive variations in dispersal systems, pollen-stigma interaction, and compatibility control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
