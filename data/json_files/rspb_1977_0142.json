The research finds an extensive transcellular system of endoplasmic reticulum in immature foetal sheep choroid plexus, suggesting its importance in transepithelial penetration of proteins and non-electrolytes. The study also shows a difference in the appearance of the tubulo-cisternal system between early and late gestation stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
