The study identifies a progressive destabilization process, where a triggering bifurcation into an overall mode of buckling is followed by secondary bifurcation into an unstable combination of at least two local modes. The analysis considers bending, shear, and longitudinal stiffnesses of the core and provides insights into the critical loads and associated post-buckling responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
