They established a reproducible criterion of purity for crystalline pyrene using zone-refining, microsublimation, and adsorption chromatography. The results showed that the fluorescence lifetime increased with increasing purity, and the pyrene excimer parameters were similar in the crystal and in solution, suggesting that the excimer molecular configuration is that of the unexcited crystal dimer with a reduced spacing between molecular planes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
