They found that the susceptibility and its temperature dependence for the close-packed hexagonal phase differ from that of the body-centered cubic phase of the same composition. The results provide data that confirm the conclusions about the density of states curves for transition metals made in a previous paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
