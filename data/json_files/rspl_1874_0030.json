The author presents evidence that supports the idea that these organisms live and multiply in the upper waters and only sink to the bottom while still alive. This conclusion is based on the author's observations of the abundance of foraminifera at abyssal depths and the distinct differences in the shells of specimens found in the upper waters and those on the sea-bed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
