This technique provides insights into the timing and temperature of various geological events, such as sedimentation, uplift, and erosion. The analysis involves measuring the number, length, and orientation of fission tracks in apatite crystals, which can reveal valuable information about the Earth's thermal history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochronology"}
