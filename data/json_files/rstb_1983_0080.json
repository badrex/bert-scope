This find, a new genus and species of the family Chigutisauridae, is significant as the last known labyrinthodont and indicates the presence of a terrestrial Early Jurassic fauna. The fossil provides evidence that labyrinthodonts survived beyond the end of the Triassic period.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
