By determining the activities of components and their relations to mineral compositions, the authors apply this knowledge to the granulites of South Harris, providing accurate pressure estimates within a range of kbar and temperature uncertainties related to pressure uncertainties.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
