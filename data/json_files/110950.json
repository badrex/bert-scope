Grove, describes his experiments on the decomposition of water and various gases using heat and electrical ignition. He developed an eudiometer to analyze the gases and found that ignited platinum could decompose water into its constituents without the need for other absorbing bodies. Grove also explored the theoretical aspects of the spheroidal state, the decomposition process, and the potential applications of this phenomenon, such as the parallel effects produced by heat and electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
