It explores different scenarios and concludes that interference may be observable in some cases, which could aid in observing weak resonances against strong backgrounds. The study focuses on the electric dipole resonance observed in mercury and its implications for interference phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
