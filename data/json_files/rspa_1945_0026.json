They provide evidence that short-period phosphorescence is primarily due to the time electrons spend in traps, rather than the time they take to move through the phosphor. This challenges the bimolecular theory of phosphorescence and supports the concept of electron traps in explaining phosphorescence processes. The study of phosphorescence decay processes provides information about electronic energy levels and the movement of electrons in solid insulators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
