The authors determine the ratio between specific heats at constant pressure and volume, and deduce the values of specific heats. They find that specific heat capacity decreases and then increases with rising temperature, and this change is more rapid at smaller volumes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical thermodynamics"}
