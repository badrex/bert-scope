H. Darwin and H. H. Turner, corrects the equilibrium theory of tides to account for the presence of continents. They introduce a new method to calculate the rise and fall of tides, considering the effect of land on the ocean's figure. The results show that the points of evanescent tides are close to the poles and that the correction to the equilibrium theory for land is significant in areas where tides vanish when there is no land.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
