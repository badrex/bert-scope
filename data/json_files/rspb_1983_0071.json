The authors argue that while a mathematical approach is not always necessary, it can provide depth and accuracy to inference procedures, especially when considering conditional arguments and the impact of different apparatuses on genetic data analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
