The author analyzes age determinations from Rb-Sr, Th-Pb, and Sm-Nd studies, as well as argon dating of highland samples. The results show that the majority of highland ages cluster around 3.85-4.00 Ga, indicating at least two events. The article also explores the significance of young highland ages and their relation to basin-forming impacts, as well as the ages of lunar maria surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Planetary Science"}
