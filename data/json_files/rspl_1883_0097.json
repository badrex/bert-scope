They discovered that the amount of light reflected by metallic surfaces varies depending on the polarization of the incident light. The findings also showed that the illumination of the paper varied with the position of the Nicol prism, being greatest when the light falling on the paper was polarized in the plane of incidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
