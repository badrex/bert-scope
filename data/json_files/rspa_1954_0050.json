They found that the hydrated haemoglobin molecule has a simple spheroidal shape with dimensions of 53x53x71 \u00c5, while the dry molecule has dimensions of 45x45x65 \u00c5. The authors also explored the packing of haemoglobin molecules in various crystalline forms and discussed the implications for understanding the molecular structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
