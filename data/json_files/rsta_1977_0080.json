The authors found that the degree of polarization depends on the surface properties, such as albedo and texture. This information can now be applied to determine albedos and surface textures for objects like asteroids and planetary satellites, for which no samples are available but for which some polarization measurements have been made.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
