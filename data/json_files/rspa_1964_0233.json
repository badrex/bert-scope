They demonstrate that these oscillations are due to conduction electron screening of ions and suggest that the Born-Green theory is useful for understanding liquid metals' properties. The study also shows that liquid insulators have different pair interactions, which can be distinguished using the Ornstein-Zernike direct correlation function."}
