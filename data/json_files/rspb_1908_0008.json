This phenomenon, called \"successive induction,\" occurs when the extensor muscles contract after the inhibitory stimulus is removed. The authors found that the contraction phase is influenced by the intensity and duration of the stimulus, and that the process is not related to the peripheral relaxation of the muscle but rather to the central inhibition and rebound. This research contributes to the understanding of the nervous system and muscle control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
