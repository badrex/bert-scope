The authors analyze the biharmonic equation of plate flexure and solve the Reynolds and energy equations to obtain temperature and pressure distributions. They compare their theoretical results with experimental measurements using optical interferometry. The study focuses on pressure bending, thermal bending, direct compression, and direct thermal expansion in thrust bearings.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
