They found that molecular damping mainly affects the external waves of the atom, causing a decrease in the -maximum. This discovery helps explain why inner shell absorption spectra of solids may not accurately represent the density of states in the conduction band.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
