They found that the absorption intensities of the forbidden line in lithium, sodium, potassium, and rubidium can be explained by quadripole radiation using Hartree's method of self-consistent fields. The results provide a possible explanation for the occurrence of certain nebular lines and the intensity of forbidden emission lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
