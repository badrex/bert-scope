These lines help in the removal of water from the faeces and maintain the osmotic balance in the insect's body. The author presents the structural complexity and physiological mechanisms of these lines, including the role of perirectal and subepithelial spaces in water reabsorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
