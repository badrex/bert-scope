They discovered that potassium chloride in solution can be electrolyzed, leading to the formation of free alkali and hydrogen gas. This research sheds light on the understanding of electrochemical reactions and the decomposition of salts in voltaic cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
