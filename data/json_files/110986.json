He discovered that a direct current passed along the artery and returned through the vein, and that this current was reversed when the connection with the lungs was severed. The author also found that the strength of the galvanic current was related to the vitality of the animal and the state of the muscles. He discussed the importance of these findings in physiological and pathological inquiries and proposed that the galvanic current plays a role in muscle function and the regulation of the body's galvanic equilibrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
