They introduce the concept of determinants of lines and their differential coefficients, which are used to derive expressions for a particle's velocity and acceleration. The author applies this method to various scenarios, including the motion of a simple pendulum and a rigid body.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
