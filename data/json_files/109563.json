The author investigates the chemical properties of gold alloys, the specific gravity of gold coins, and the wear caused by friction. The findings suggest that the loss of gold in coins is not due to defects in the composition of the gold but may be caused by the rough impression and milled edge used in coinage.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
