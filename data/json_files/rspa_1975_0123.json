The authors focus on techniques to improve resolution, such as increasing magnetic field strength, using difference spectroscopy, and reducing the number of observed resonances through chemical modifications. They demonstrate these methods on the protein lysozyme, which has a well-known structure for comparison.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
