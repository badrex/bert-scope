The authors emphasize the need to investigate the mechanisms behind plasticity, including the influence of heredity and environment, and the role of short axon cells in inhibiting unwanted connections. The human brain's potential for connection and critical periods in children are also discussed as areas of future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
