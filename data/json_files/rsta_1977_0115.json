The authors describe the occurrences, petrography, and mineralogy of cherts and porcelanites recovered from various ocean basins by the Deep Sea Drilling Project. They also discuss the formation processes and the conversion of opal-CT to quartz in these rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
