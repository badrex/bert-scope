They found that area MT has a multidimensional functional organization, including direction and orientation preferences. The results suggest that area MT processes both motion and shape variables, challenging the idea of a purely shape-independent organization in this area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
