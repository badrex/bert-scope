These medallions were made using a new ceramic material called jasper, which allowed for affordable and durable reproductions of portraits. Many famous artists and modellers, such as Sir Joshua Reynolds and John Flaxman, designed and modeled the medallions, which were often made from original wax portraits. Over 70 portrait medallions of Fellows of the Royal Society were produced, celebrating their contributions to science and art.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Art History"}
