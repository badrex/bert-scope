The author discusses various factors affecting the training of rivers, such as estuary form, tidal capacity, fresh-water discharge, and silt accumulation. The author also presents a method of investigation to determine the effects of training works in any estuary, using the Seine Estuary as a case study.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology and River Engineering"}
