They found that a lethal dose of beta rays could prevent cancer cells from growing when transplanted into normal susceptible rats. The study showed that cells are most susceptible to radiation when they are in a state of division. The results suggest that radiation therapy can temporarily prevent cancer cells from dividing, which may help in treating cancer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
