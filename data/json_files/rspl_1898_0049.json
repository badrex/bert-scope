The authors discuss the differences between descending and ascending readings, the effects of temperature, and the influence of various factors on aneroid performance. The findings aim to help improve the usefulness of the Kew test and provide guidelines for rejecting or improving aneroids.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
