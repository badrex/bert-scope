They found that the cays were formed in an area of recent tectonic uplift, and that the local emergence of the area simulated conditions once thought to be more widespread. The authors also discussed the climate and marine environment of the region, including rainfall patterns and the impact of earthquakes on the area.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
