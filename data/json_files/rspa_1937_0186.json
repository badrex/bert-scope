They observed differences in the fine structure of the Balmer series and examined the intensity patterns of the Stark components. The results showed that certain components were rendered particularly diffuse, and the irregular spacing of Stark components in the four Balmer lines of deuterium was confirmed. The study provided evidence that the irregularities in the displacements were due to the effects of fine structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
