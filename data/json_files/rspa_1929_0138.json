The authors found that the adsorption is significantly influenced by hydrogen ion concentration, with different acids and bases exhibiting varying degrees of adsorption. The results provide insights into the behavior of adsorbents and their potential applications in fields such as enzyme chemistry and vitamin studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Chemistry"}
