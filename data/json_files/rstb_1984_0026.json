It explains the molecular structure of these proteins and their role in seed maturation and growth. The article also highlights the similarities between storage proteins and lectins, such as their subunit structures and the presence of sugar residues in their molecular structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
