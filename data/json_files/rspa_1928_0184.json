They discovered that the corrosion-time curves obtained by measuring the absorption of oxygen gas were exponential. The authors found that hydrogen gas was evolved during the corrosion process, which affected the accuracy of the oxygen absorption method for measuring corrosion. They suggested that the hydrogen gas was likely formed by reacting with potassium hydroxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
