The authors discuss the efficiency of drying tubes, the effects of air passing through apparatus containing dew-point instruments, and the accuracy of chemical methods compared to tabulated vacuum pressures. They also analyze the behavior of nearly saturated air and its impact on hygrometric measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
