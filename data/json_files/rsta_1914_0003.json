They measured the pressure-temperature curve for saturated vapor, latent heat, total heat of the liquid, specific heat of the gas, and the Joule-Thomson effect. The results provided data for constructing a new entropy-temperature diagram for carbon dioxide at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
