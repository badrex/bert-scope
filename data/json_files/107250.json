He found that the size and number of plates in the apparatus greatly affected its performance, with larger combinations being more effective for overcoming resistance in imperfect conductors. Children also discovered that the intensity of the electricity was proportional to the number of plates, while the quantity given out was related to the size of the plates. This research led to improvements in Voltaic apparatus construction and better understanding of their applications in chemical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
