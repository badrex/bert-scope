He conducts experiments to determine if these fungi can grow in snow and under various conditions. Bauer discovers that the fungi can regenerate in snow and that they may be the native inhabitants of this environment. The paper includes a drawing illustrating the fungi's growth in the snow.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
