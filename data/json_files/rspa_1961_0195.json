The study focuses on the initial speed of the shock and the distribution of pressure and velocity between the piston and the shock. The findings show that at large times, the shock propagates at a uniform speed given by the Bethe-Teller theory, while at close distances from the piston, the shock speed is determined by frozen downstream conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
