They found that the X-rays caused a slight difference in potential between the metals, suggesting that the rays have an electrolytic effect on the contact potential. This discovery expanded the understanding of the properties of X-rays and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
