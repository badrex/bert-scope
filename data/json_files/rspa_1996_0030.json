The authors found that the isothermal oxidation of calcium sulphite is strongly deceleratory, and rate characteristics were described by kinetic expressions based on diffusion control. The study included investigations of three related reactions that also yield calcium sulphate, and all rate processes were satisfactorily represented by the same diffusion-controlled rate equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Flue-Gas Desulphurization"}
