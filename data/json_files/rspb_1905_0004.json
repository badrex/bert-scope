The authors found that the average carbon dioxide content was 94 volumes per 10,000 volumes of air. They observed that the carbon dioxide content was generally higher in winter months, but 1901 was an exception with a higher average in July. The authors suggest that these variations could impact plant growth and recommend systematic daily observations at different locations to better understand the effects on agriculture.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
