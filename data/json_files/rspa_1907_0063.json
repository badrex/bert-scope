The author explains the role of the gyroscopic effect in maintaining the axis of rotation parallel to the tangent of the trajectory and discusses the forces acting on the projectile, which are responsible for the deviation from the simple range formula. The article also explores the relationship between the angle of the projectile's axis and its direction of motion, and the forces acting on the projectile due to the interaction with the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
