The results show that these lesions cause a significant impairment in recall without affecting the recognition of the stimuli. The findings highlight the critical role of the mid-dorsolateral frontal cortex in monitoring self-generated responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
