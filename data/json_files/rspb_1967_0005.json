They discovered that the supraoptic nucleus releases vasopressin without oxytocin, while the paraventricular nucleus releases both hormones. This research helps to understand the independent release of these hormones and their functions in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
