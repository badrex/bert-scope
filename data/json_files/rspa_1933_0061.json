They found that the atomic volume of each phase in a mixed region remains constant, but the constant atomic volume of one phase depends on the other phase with it. The results provide insights into the changes in atomic volume and lattice dimensions in copper-zinc alloys and their phase transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
