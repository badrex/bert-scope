They derive a general amplitude equation and find that nonlinear effects can be either stabilizing or destabilizing, depending on the density ratio and other factors. The study provides insights into the dynamics of unstable waves and the role of soliton-like modulations in the instability process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
