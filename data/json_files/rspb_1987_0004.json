Minnows generally choose behaviors that minimize their chances of being eaten. They switch from dispersed small shoals to a compact school and perform inspection behavior to recognize and gather information about the predator. After the predator attacks, minnows use costly tactics like flash expansion and fountain, but individuals may become separated and more vulnerable. Minnows from provenances with and without pike exhibit similar antipredator behaviors, but those sympatric with the predator integrate their tactics more effectively. Shoal size affects the execution of tactics, with smaller shoals more likely to abandon schooling behavior and seek cover.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
