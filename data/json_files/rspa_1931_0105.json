Chapman, presents a comprehensive study of various phenomena in the upper atmosphere, including meteors, light absorption, radio and sound wave propagation, and the Earth's magnetism. He discusses the role of solar radiation, particularly in the ultra-violet spectrum, in the absorption and dissociation of gases in the atmosphere. Chapman also explores the ionization of the air in the ionized layers and the chemical equilibrium in the ozone layer, providing a detailed analysis of the processes occurring in these regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
