The author examines the continuous and banded spectra of lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, and cesium salts, as well as the spectra of calcium, strontium, and barium compounds. The study highlights the differences in the spectra of these elements and the importance of the salts' purity and volatility in their thermo-chemical decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
