They investigate the isotherms and entropies of these models, considering the influence of sorbate-sorbate interactions where possible. The study focuses on intracrystalline sorption in aluminosilicate lattices, providing insights into the thermodynamics of this process and its implications for understanding the behavior of sorbed molecules within these structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
