They explore the geometrical properties of these curves, including their definitions, theorems, and connections to the Hessian. The study also covers the concept of conjugate poles and their relation to the curves, as well as the satellite lines and points.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
