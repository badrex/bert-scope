They found that the rate of isomerization increases with temperature and follows the normal Arrhenius law. The overall energies of activation for the isomerization reactions were determined, and the results showed that both cis-trans equilibrium and an additional isomerization reaction, forming 1-butene, occur during the process. This research provides insights into the kinetics and thermodynamics of polysulphone formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
