They discovered that the flow of helium became almost independent of pressure in long, narrow capillaries, suggesting that this might be due to slip on the walls of the capillary. The research aimed to investigate the flow through capillaries of various diameters and lengths to gain a better understanding of the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
