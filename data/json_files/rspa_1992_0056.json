They use a singular perturbation problem approach, finding a solution of the Stokes equations that satisfies the boundary conditions on the body and matches the outer solution in the matching region. The study provides an unambiguous result for the lift on an elliptic cylinder at incidence and demonstrates the relationship between two-dimensional flow and equivalent three-dimensional flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
