The authors describe the molecular properties, biological activities, and amino acid sequences of C1r and C1s, and how they interact with other complement components. They also model the structures of these enzymes to understand their catalytic mechanisms and specificity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
