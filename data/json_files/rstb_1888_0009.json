They investigated the movements evoked by stimulating different areas of the cortex, including the posterior third of the frontal convolutions, the upper third of the ascending frontal convolution, the superior parietal lobule, and the posterior half of the ascending parietal convolution. Their research aimed to complete the investigation of the upper part of the excitable region of the outer convex surface of the hemisphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Motor Cortex"}
