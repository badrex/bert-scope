The authors found that the first stage of combustion is mildly exothermic, while the second stage is strongly affected by changes in mixture strength and compressed gas temperature. The second stage can be weakened or even quenched by enhancing heat-transfer rates. This research helps to understand spontaneous ignition in engines and improve their efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Combustion and Fuel Engineering"}
