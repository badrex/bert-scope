This technique relies on the decay of carbon-14 over time, with an average lifespan of 5,730 years. The process involves converting carbon dioxide into plants, which are then consumed by animals, incorporating the carbon-14 into their bodies. When the organism dies, the carbon-14 decays at a known rate, allowing scientists to estimate the age of the sample. This method has been widely used in archaeology to date artifacts and understand the history of human civilizations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Archaeology"}
