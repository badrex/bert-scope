It focuses on constructing magnetic maps and comparing the general theory of M. Gauss with the facts of observation. The author presents two series of sea observations made by Mr. Dunlop and Lieut. Sulivan, and 120 determinations from various parts of the world to derive the position of the magnetic lines. The article also discusses the magnetic intensity observations made at sea and the isodynamic lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
