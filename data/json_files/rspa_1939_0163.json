They discovered that the emission of y-rays and alpha particles from the excited 20Ne nucleus shows sharp resonances, confirming the mechanism responsible for the extreme sharpness of the observed resonance levels. The results provide strong evidence for the emission of a single excited state of 160 after the compound nucleus 20Ne* emits an alpha-particle of low energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
