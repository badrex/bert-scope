The analysis reveals that the vertebrae are rhachitomous and schizomerous, with neural arch elements in the atlas-axis complex consisting of paired pro- and atlas arches and a massive axis arch. The study also discusses the ribs, scales, appendicular skeleton, dermal pectoral girdle, pectoral limb, pelvic girdle, and pelvic limb of G. burkemorani. The findings contribute to understanding the early evolution of tetrapods and the sequence of characters diagnostic of smaller taxonomic groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
