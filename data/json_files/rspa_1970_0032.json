The author presents a theoretical model that considers the effects of applied shear stress on complete dislocations and their associated faulted areas. The model is used to analyze the equilibrium positions of dislocations in planar arrays and to discuss aspects of cleavage fracture characteristics in ordered alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanics"}
