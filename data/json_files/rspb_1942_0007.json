The authors found that visual purple is sensitive to ultra-violet light, and the retina should be sensitive to this range of light. They also discovered that aphakic eyes are more sensitive to ultra-violet light than ordinary eyes, and the mechanism of vision appears to be the same as for ordinary visible light.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Visual System"}
