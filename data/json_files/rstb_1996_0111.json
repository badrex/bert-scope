The authors discuss the automatic selection and reproductive assurance hypotheses, and present phenotypic selection models to examine the selection of floral traits promoting self-pollination. They also consider the role of neutral genetic variation in understanding the evolution of selfing in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
