The authors find that the source counts have a Euclidean slope, and the measurements of fluctuations in the X-ray background suggest that the Euclidean form of the source counts can be extrapolated to flux levels at least an order of magnitude fainter than the catalog limit. The authors also analyze the optical identification of sources, which enables them to determine the X-ray luminosity functions of clusters of galaxies and active galaxies and estimate their contribution to the diffuse X-ray background.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
