It examines the relationship between nucleosynthesis and baryonic matter, and explores the constraints placed on the density of baryonic matter by the observed abundances of light elements, such as helium, deuterium, and lithium. The article also considers the implications of these findings for the nature of dark matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
