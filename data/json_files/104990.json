Despite little wind, boats near the harbor tumbled and tossed, and the waters rose to a higher level than usual. This event lasted about three-quarters of an hour before returning to normal. The author notes that this phenomenon was not observed on the southern coast of Devonshire.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
