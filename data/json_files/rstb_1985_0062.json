The results show that these opioids can reduce nociceptive responses, with ketamine being particularly effective at lower doses. The study also suggests that N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors play a significant role in mediating these responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
