They found that two different sub-races of albinoes exist, one that clots upon intravascular injection of nucleo-proteids and another that does not. The results show that albinoes injected with nucleo-proteids derived from albino animals do not have an absolute failure of coagulation, unlike when injected with nucleo-proteids from pigmented animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
