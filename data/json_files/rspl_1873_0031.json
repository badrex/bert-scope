H. N. Hennessey discovered white lines in the solar spectrum while studying atmospheric lines using a spectroscope from the Royal Society. These white lines, which resemble threads of white floss silk, are not bright lines and are best seen around noon. Hennessey found these lines in the spectrum from extreme red to F and noticed that they grow dim and disappear when the slit is opened wide. The white lines are not mentioned in Kirchhoff's map, adding to the mystery of their origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Spectrum"}
