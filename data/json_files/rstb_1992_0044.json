They identified key residues that bind at or near the adenine, ribose, and y-phosphate of ATP, which could aid in understanding the molecular structure and function of myosin, a molecular motor involved in muscle contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
