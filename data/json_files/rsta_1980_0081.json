Hot torsion tests were conducted on three steels with varying Mn:S ratios. The results showed that the ductility depended on the Mn:S ratio and the grain size. Thermodynamic data and elemental analysis revealed that the sulphur concentration and coverage on grain boundaries were higher in steel C compared to steel A. The segregated sulphur levels correlated closely with the hot ductility results, indicating that the Mn:S ratio's effect on hot ductility is mainly due to the embrittling influence of sulphur.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
