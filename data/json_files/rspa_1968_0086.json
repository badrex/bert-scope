Deep holograms have unique properties, such as directional selectivity, color selectivity, and the suppression of the twin wave. These properties make deep holograms valuable for applications like projection screens for three-dimensional images. The theory also discusses the information storage form in the random pattern of diffuse holograms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
