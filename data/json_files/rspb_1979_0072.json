Seven species of Homalium, ten species of Xylosma, and one species of Casearia were found to have nickel concentrations above 1000 pg/g dry mass. The Flacourtiaceae family, which includes these hyperaccumulators, is among the most primitive angiosperms. The research suggests that hyperaccumulation of nickel may be an evolutionary character that occurs in long-indisturbed floras, such as that of New Caledonia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology and Ecology"}
