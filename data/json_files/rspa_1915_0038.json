They used a gold leaf electroscope and a Dolezalek electrometer to measure the rate of electroscope leak when glucose solution was fermented with and without yeast. The results showed that the rate of electroscope leak increased when the yeast was added, indicating that the CO2 gas produced during fermentation was ionized and carried an electric charge.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
