The author highlights the role of pH in the resistance of the corneal endothelium to toxic effects of glycerol and damage from freezing. The author also suggests that the buffering effect of proteins in biological fluids might be a rationale for incorporating them in preserving media for tissues and cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Tissue Engineering"}
