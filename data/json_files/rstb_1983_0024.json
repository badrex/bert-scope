The research correlates periods of abundant speleothem growth with interglacial isotope stages and periods of zero growth with glacial stages. The findings may also be related to the British Quaternary sequence within the range of radiocarbon determinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
