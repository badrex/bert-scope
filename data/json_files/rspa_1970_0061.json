The authors find that these constants are in agreement with values calculated using magneto-elastic constants from acoustic paramagnetic resonance experiments. They also discuss possible causes for anomalies in the thermal resistivity, concluding that they result from phonon interactions with exchange-coupled pairs of ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
