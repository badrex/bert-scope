The authors analyze various factors, such as time constraints, interruptions, refuges from predators, and stochasticity in food supply, to determine how an animal's decisions and state change over time. They provide general results and discuss how earlier models can be viewed as special cases of their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
