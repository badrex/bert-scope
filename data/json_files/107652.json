He demonstrates that the ophthalmic nerve is responsible for bestowing sensibility on the eye and surrounding areas, and that it does not directly control the muscles involved in eye movement. Bell also discusses the respiratory nerve of the face and its connection to the eyelids and forehead, as well as the role of the fourth nerve in eye movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
