The author compares the solar spectrum when the sun is high and low, focusing on the atmospheric lines due to absorption. The study helps determine the lines in the solar spectrum caused by specific atmospheric absorption and not by the general weakening of light.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
