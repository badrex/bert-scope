The experiments showed that light alone does not decompose corrosive sublimate, and the solubility of the substance varies with different solvents. The author also discovered that when heated with certain oils, corrosive sublimate undergoes chemical reactions and forms new compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Decomposition"}
