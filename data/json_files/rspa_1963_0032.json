The researchers found that increasing pressure reduces the rate of bromine uptake and that the limiting uptake is influenced by the applied pressure. The findings provide valuable information about the internal constraints in graphite and the formation of intercalation compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Intercalation compounds and Graphite chemistry"}
