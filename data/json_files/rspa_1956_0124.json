They compare their findings with similar worldwide studies and discuss the albedo of the earth and atmosphere at different seasons. The study helps in understanding the local energy balance and contributes to the International Geophysical Year 1957-58 project.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
