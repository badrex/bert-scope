They found that these systems exhibit unique properties, such as acting as semi-permeable membranes with a concentration gradient across them, generating a species of osmotic pressure. The study also highlighted the differences in the rheological behavior of these gels compared to Newtonian fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Rheology"}
