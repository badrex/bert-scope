They found that the molecular rearrangement process increases in importance relatively to the chain reaction with the ascent of the series and with pressure. The results do not support the idea of a constant order of reaction or a uniform transition from second order to first order for unimolecular reactions dependent on a single mode of activation by collision.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
