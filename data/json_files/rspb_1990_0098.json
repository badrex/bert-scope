This finding raises the possibility that the ubiquitous BK channel may play a role during pathophysiological events. The study demonstrates that ATP and cromakalim have similar effects on BK channels in different smooth muscle types, such as rabbit aortic, rabbit tracheal, and pig coronary artery.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
