They found that most of the transit peptide sequence is necessary and sufficient for transport into chloroplasts, but high efficiency requires domains from both the transit peptide and the mature small subunit protein. This research provides insight into the complex mechanism of protein binding, import, and processing in chloroplasts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
