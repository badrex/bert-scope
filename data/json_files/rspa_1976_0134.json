They show that intersections between potential energy surfaces can occur due to symmetry in one region of nuclear configuration space, leading to intersections in regions of higher dimension and lower symmetry. This behavior is demonstrated in octahedral complexes with spin-orbit coupling.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
