It highlights how their diet, rich in animal foods and a variety of uncultivated plant foods, contributed to their good health and lean physique. The low energy density of their diet, along with other nutritional qualities, protected them against obesity, non-insulin-dependent diabetes, and cardiovascular diseases. However, the author warns that if these communities continue to westernize, they may become susceptible to these health issues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Nutrition and Dietetics"}
