The research uses a variety of fibers with different crystallinities and examines their strength at various strain rates. The results show that the strength of both carbon and para-aramid fibers follows the Weibull distribution, with different behaviors observed in the scale parameter as a function of strain rate. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms governing the fibers' strength and can help improve the understanding of composite materials' rate dependencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
