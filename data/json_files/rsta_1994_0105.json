The authors apply this analysis to numerical weather prediction models, the El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon, and the problem of climate change, demonstrating its potential for improving our understanding and forecasting abilities in atmospheric and oceanic dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
