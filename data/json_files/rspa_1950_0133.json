They clarify the use of this scheme and provide correct expressions for elastic constants, emphasizing the importance of the equilibrium condition for defining elastic constants. The author also demonstrates the limitations of the general scheme and introduces a different technique for discussing problems related to stresses and elastic constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
