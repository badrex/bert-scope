Analytical and numerical methods were used to examine the effects of particle diameter, particle-number density, and diaphragm-pressure ratio on the flow's transitional behavior. The results provide insights into the interaction of gas and particles in dusty gas flows and help to understand the structure of stationary shock waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
