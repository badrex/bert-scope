It focuses on the changes in body shape and appendage development during the transition from nauplius to copepodid. The research highlights the unique morphological and behavioral features of different harpacticoid families and the importance of intermoult stages in tracing the origin and homology of larval and juvenile structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
