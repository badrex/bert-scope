The authors found that the strength of silica is highly dependent on testing conditions and can vary from 280 to 1500 N. They also discovered that factors such as heat treatment, specimen preparation, and the surrounding atmosphere significantly impact the strength of the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
