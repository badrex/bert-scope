{"revised_title": "Reversible Formation of Starch from Glucose-1-Phosphate: Enzymatic Mechanism and Inhibitors", "semantic_tags": ["Enzyme", "Starch synthesis", "Glucose-1-phosphate", "Phosphorylase", "Inhibitors"], "tldr": "The author discovered an enzyme called phosphorylase that can convert glucose-1-phosphate into starch. The enzyme is found in potato tubers and works by transferring a phosphate group to an acceptor molecule, which then forms starch. The reaction is inhibited by inorganic phosphate, heavy metal ions, and the products of the reaction, glucose and inorganic phosphate. This discovery helps us understand how starch is synthesized in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry", "article_id": "rspa_1941_0024"}
