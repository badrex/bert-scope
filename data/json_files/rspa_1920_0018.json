They discovered that the rate of gas evolution and total volume of gas produced are significantly influenced by the frequency of the alternating current. The authors also observed that the platinum electrodes change appearance and lose their ability to evolve gas over time, suggesting a relationship between electrode material and the electrolysis process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
