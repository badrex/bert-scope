Tillard observed a volcanic eruption off the coast of St. Michael's Island. The eruption created a large crater and produced black smoke and ash. The surrounding sea was also affected, with the depth decreasing near the eruption site. The author describes the eruption's violence, the sounds it made, and the heat it generated. The eruption destroyed fish and left behind a spongy, cinder-like material.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
