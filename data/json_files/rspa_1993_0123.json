By considering a coordinate system defined by the shock's motion, the author derives a first-order approximation that includes additional terms compared to previous theories. This new theory reveals a hierarchical wave structure and can be applied to problems like shock diffraction and blast wave propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
