He discovered that the crystals exhibit different colors when viewed by reflected or transmitted light, and the two images formed by double refraction have different color compositions. The salt also has a specific action on a particular red ray in the spectrum when exposed to polarized light.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
