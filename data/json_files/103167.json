He discovered the presence of numerous moving particles within muscle membranes and found that muscles lay their eggs on their shells. He also examined the ovaries and the unborn muscles within them, as well as the gut contents of muscles, which contained sand and other particles. This research provided valuable insights into muscle anatomy and reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
