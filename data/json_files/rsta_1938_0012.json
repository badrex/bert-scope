They investigate the effects of the Earth's magnetic field on wave-packets and the level of reflection in the ionosphere. The study is applicable to any plane-stratified doubly refracting medium and provides insights into the behavior of radio waves in the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
