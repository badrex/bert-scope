They calculate the linear and nonlinear contributions to the angle of rotation of a plane-polarized photon beam by a solution of optically active molecules and demonstrate that nonlinear processes can lead to an intensity-dependent contribution to the optical rotation angle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
