They discuss the factors determining the average velocities of solute atoms attracted to a dislocation and set up an equation for the concentration of solute atoms around the dislocation. The study compares the characteristics of plastic flow below a critical range with those of micro-creep in tin crystals and emphasizes the need for further experiments on micro-creep.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
