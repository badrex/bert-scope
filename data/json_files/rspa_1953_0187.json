They discovered that hydrogen causes an immediate increase in internal friction, which decreases over time. The findings suggest that there are various relaxation processes in the alloy, and the internal friction is related to the initial grain size. The research also shows that hydrogen reduces both Young's modulus and rigidity modulus of palladium.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Hydrogen storage"}
