It explores the factors that control the solid-state polymerization of disubstituted diacetylenes and the perfection of the resultant polymer crystals. The author also examines the physical properties of polydiacetylenes, including their electrical conductivity, optical properties, and photoconductivity. The article highlights the importance of studying polydiacetylene samples with different morphologies to understand how their physical properties are affected by sample morphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
