These compounds are synthesized through various reactions, including the distillation of urethanes with phosphoric anhydride. The author discusses the physical properties, boiling points, and reactions of these cyanates with water, alcohols, and ammonia derivatives. The phenyl and tolylic cyanates exhibit immediate reactions, while the xylylic cyanate has a slower reaction rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
