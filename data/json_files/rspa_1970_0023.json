They determined the magnetic hyperfine and electric quadrupole parameters and compared them with various molecular wavefunctions. This research provides detailed information about the molecular wavefunction and is important for understanding the structure and properties of diatomic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
