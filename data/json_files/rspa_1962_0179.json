The author investigates the transition probability and its dependency on rotational quantum numbers, finding that vibration-rotation interaction has a significant effect on rotational temperature and is especially important for certain bands. The study provides insights into the variation of transition moments with internuclear distance and offers corrections to rotational temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
