He conducts experiments to demonstrate the rapid circulation of substances through the body and the time it takes for a poison to penetrate the capillary vessels and cause general effects. The study highlights the importance of preventing poisons from entering the general circulation to avoid severe consequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Toxicology"}
