The model suggests that cell circulation within the grex serves as the propulsive engine for migrating grexes, with amoebae orienting their motion by cAMP chemotaxis. Experiments support the model's predictions and provide insights into the cell trajectories responsible for grex locomotion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
