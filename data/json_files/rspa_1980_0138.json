They analyze the transient creep following stress reductions and determine the friction stress as a function of temperature and directional solidification conditions. The results provide evidence for the operation of recovery-creep in both the composite and matrix alloys, and the friction stress and flow stress are found to be influenced by the matrix behavior and microstructure.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Composites"}
