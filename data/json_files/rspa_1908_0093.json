The researchers observed that all lines become broader under high pressures, with the broadening increasing as pressure increases. Two types of broadening were observed: series lines, which become faint and hazy under higher pressures, and non-series lines, which remain well-defined. The study also found that the most intense portion of each line is displaced from its position at atmospheric pressure, with the displacement being in the direction of greater wavelength. The displacement is continuous and linear with the pressure, and the rates of increase are different for different lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
