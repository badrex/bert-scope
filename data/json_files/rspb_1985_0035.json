The research characterizes motorneuron pools by four criteria: position in the rostrocaudal axis, median position, number of labeled cells, and position in the transverse plane of the spinal cord. The findings provide a map to assay neuromuscular specificity in experiments on limb regeneration in axolotls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
