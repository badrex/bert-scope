The authors describe experiments on auricles, showing that acetylcholine synthesis is related to contraction and that acetylcholine acts as a brake on the heart. They also explore the effects of drugs like paludrine on acetylcholine's action, suggesting that drugs can compete with local hormones for receptors in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology > Cardiology"}
