They highlight the unique features of the mammalian skull, such as the rupture of the side walls due to the pressure of the large lateral masses of the cerebrum and the development of the nasal organs, which set them apart from other animals like Sauropsida, Crocodiles, and Birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
