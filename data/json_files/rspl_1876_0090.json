This method involved exposing the germs to a low temperature for a brief period, killing the germs that were on the verge of becoming active while leaving the others intact. By repeating this process, Tyndall was able to completely sterilize even the most resistant infusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
