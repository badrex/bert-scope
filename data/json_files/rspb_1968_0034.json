They identified two types of synaptic contacts in the frog's inner plexiform layer, one with a synaptic ribbon and the other with a dense aggregation of synaptic vesicles. These findings suggest that bipolar terminals primarily synapse with amacrine processes, amacrine processes synapse extensively with other amacrine cells, and ganglion cells are driven primarily by amacrine cells. The study provides insights into the anatomical basis for the complex physiology of the frog retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
