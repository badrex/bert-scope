The study involves the use of symbols like O and D to differentiate and eliminate variables, leading to the development of a conic of 5-pointic contact. The results are compared with those of Mr. Cayley, demonstrating the identity of the expressions derived by both methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
