They discovered that the Erysiphe (\\#xE6;cidium) fungus is a condition of Puccinia magnusiana, and not a condition of Puccinia phragmitis as previously thought. The author also found that the Erysiphe (\\#xE6;cidium) fungus can be found on various plants, including Bumex hydrolapathum, obtusifolius, conglomeratus, and Bheum officinale.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
