They investigated the effects of replacing the native zinc atom with other metal ions and chemically modifying amino acid side chains. The results showed that the enzyme's dual specificity, as an esterase and peptidase, was influenced by the metal ion and the chemical modifications. The authors proposed a dual site model for peptide and ester binding and discussed the role of the metal in the catalytic process. They also explored the entatic state of metalloenzymes and the importance of suitable models for understanding their mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
