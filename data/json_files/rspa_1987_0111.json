They found that both octahedral and tetrahedral sublattices play a significant role in the conduction process, with both hopping and continuous diffusion modes contributing to ion transport. The study aimed to explore and demonstrate the physics of this intriguing superionic material and make predictions about its structure and transport properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
