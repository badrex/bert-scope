First, he describes the appearance of transparent objects, particularly saline crystals, when viewed through a microscope and illuminated by polarized light. Second, he presents a principle for accurate measurement of light intensity, which can be applied to photometry. He also suggests using similar methods for measuring quantities in other branches of physical science, such as high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
