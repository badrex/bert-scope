They found that after adrenalectomy, decerebration led to a decrease in liver glycogen and a rise in blood sugar levels. This suggests that the diabetogenic impulses set up by decerebration may act on the liver and muscle glycogen after adrenalectomy. The presence of the adrenal gland seems to be necessary for maintaining the functional integrity of the glycogenolytic nerve fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Endocrinology"}
