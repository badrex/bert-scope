He explains how he first suspected the presence of the element through spectroscopy and then details the methods he used to extract and analyze it. Thallium is a heavy metal with a high atomic weight, and it has unique chemical reactions, including the formation of two oxides and a chloride.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Elemental Chemistry"}
