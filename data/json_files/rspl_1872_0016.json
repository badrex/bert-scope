Norman Lockyer, discusses his research in spectrum analysis in connection with the solar spectrum. He examines the disappearance of certain spectral lines when using a specific method and identifies the longest lines as being reversed in the solar atmosphere. This discovery helps add zinc and aluminum to the list of solar elements and provides insight into the study of cyclical changes in the solar spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
