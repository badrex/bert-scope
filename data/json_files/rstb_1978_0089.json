Dolichyl phosphates are found to be involved in glycosyl transfer in all plant members studied. The process of O- and N-glycosylation of proteins in yeasts and hyphal fungi is also explored, with similarities to that found in green plants. The antibiotic tunicamycin is shown to inhibit the transfer of N-acetylglucosamine phosphate, blocking protein N-glycosylation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
