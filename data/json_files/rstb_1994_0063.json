They explain how these surfaces help fish in signaling information about their movements and remaining almost invisible from most points of view. The authors also discuss the effects of changing the orientation of these surfaces on the overall appearance of the fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Behavior"}
