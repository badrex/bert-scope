The authors discuss the disease's distribution, age distribution, and the role of the insect vector, the sandfly. They conclude that transmission is primarily through the bite of an insect, and the sandfly fulfills the necessary conditions to be the vector responsible for the disease's spread.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
