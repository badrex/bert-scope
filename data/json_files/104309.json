Stack, describes his observations of two mock-suns in Wittemberg and discusses the phenomenon of parhelia. He explains the formation of halos and parhelia through the refraction and reflection of light in the atmosphere. Additionally, Stack discusses a red Aurora Borealis observed in Europe, which he attributes to the reflection and refraction of light in the atmosphere's lower region filled with uniform-density vapors.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
