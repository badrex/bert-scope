It is found that breakdown results from the formation and growth of a vapor bubble in the liquid. The research suggests that vaporization is initiated by the development of points of zero pressure in the liquid, which is influenced by submicroscopic particle impurities. This theory predicts the breakdown characteristics of various liquids with low viscosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
