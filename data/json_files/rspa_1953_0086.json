They found that when the height of the crests of standing waves reaches about the wavelength, they become pointed in the form of a ridge. The experiments confirmed Penney and Price's predictions about the instability of two-dimensional waves and revealed the development of three-dimensional instability. The findings contribute to the understanding of fluid dynamics and wave mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
