The authors measure the torque on a crystal of aluminum in a uniform magnetic field and analyze the resulting oscillations to determine the periods of the high-frequency oscillations. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties and behavior of aluminum and contributes to the understanding of the de Haas-van Alphen effect in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
