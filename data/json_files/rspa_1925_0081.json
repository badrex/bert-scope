They propose a model of reaction centers on the catalyst surface and discuss the energy changes involved in the process. The findings provide insights into the non-uniform activity of catalyst surfaces and the role of adsorption films in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
