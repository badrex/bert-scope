They discuss various methods for finding equivalent ratios in different musical systems, and explore the importance of regular systems in forming symmetrical scales. The authors also introduce a notation system for representing musical intervals and discuss the application of different musical systems to various instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
