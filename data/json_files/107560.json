They explain the process of converting observed differences on the barometer's scale into feet of elevation and provide a detailed account of their measurements. This method allowed for more accurate elevation measurements and contributed to the understanding of mountain heights.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
