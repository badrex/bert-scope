The balance between gravitational and viscous torques determines their orientation, which affects their swimming direction. The research extends previous theories to predict the orientation of spheroidal cells in various flow conditions, providing insights into laboratory manipulation of algae trajectories and the development of collective behavior in their suspensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
