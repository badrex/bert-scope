They discovered that the strains had distinct morphological differences, with the Zululand strain being monomorphic and the Uganda strain being dimorphic. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the uniformity of T. brucei and highlights the importance of strain differentiation in medical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
