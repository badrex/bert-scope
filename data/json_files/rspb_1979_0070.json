They find that the average value of m (number of quantal packets) at normal nerve-muscle junctions is about 288, which increases to around 380 when considering temporal dispersion of quantal release. After treatment with diaminopyridine or tetraethylammonium, transmitter release is greatly enhanced, with values of m exceeding 104 found frequently. The authors also discuss the relationship between quantal content and neuromuscular facilitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
