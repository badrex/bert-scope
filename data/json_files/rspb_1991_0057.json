The researchers found that the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) is responsible for modulating the responsivity of a neural system in the superior temporal gyrus, which is the site of the distributed word store. This suggests that the DLPFC plays a crucial role in the intrinsic generation of words.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Cognitive Neuroscience"}
