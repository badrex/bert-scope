The study uses a combination of geophysical and geological surveys, including continuous seismic profiling, bottom sampling, and vibrocoring, to understand the bedrock morphology and structures within the overlying sediments. The findings provide insights into the formation and evolution of the bay and its surrounding coastal features."}
