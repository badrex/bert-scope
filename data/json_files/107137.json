They discovered that warm winds cause water at the surface to heat up and sink, increasing the depth of the pits. The author also found that water at the bottom of deep lakes remains at a constant temperature, supporting their theory that fluids are not good conductors of heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
