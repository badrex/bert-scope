The authors explore the challenges of finding variational principles in the Eulerian description and propose a potential representation for the Eulerian velocity to overcome these difficulties. They also demonstrate how this representation can be applied to electromagnetic fields and provide examples of its use in fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
