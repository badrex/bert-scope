They observed chromatolysis in ganglionic neurons, which involved central aggregation of dense bodies, displacement and indentation of the nucleus, and increased staining of the nuclear rim. The study also showed signs of phagocytosis of neuronal cytoplasm by sheath cells and evidence of sprouting from axons and cell bodies. The findings suggest that the neuron in chromatolysis undergoes a form of partial involution that may relate more to its transmitter and receptive functions than to processes concerned with regrowth of the axon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
