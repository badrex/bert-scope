It proposes that icy planetesimals from the outer solar system played a major role in creating the atmospheres of Mars, Earth, and possibly Venus. The study also suggests that cometary impacts could have provided the necessary conditions for the origin of life on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
