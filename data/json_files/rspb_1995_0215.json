They find that nectar spur morphology influences reproductive success and reproductive isolation, and that the evolution of nectar spurs is temporally linked with increased diversification in the genus Aquilegia. This supports the hypothesis that nectar spurs are a key innovation in plant evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
