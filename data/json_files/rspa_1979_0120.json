The author finds that the solids may slowly slide with respect to each other without ever slipping globally, and the sliding velocity can be changed by shearing the bodies. The problem can be solved in closed form when the separation and slip zones propagate along the interface with supersonic velocities, but the results contain too many parameters, and specific examples must be considered to assess the interaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
