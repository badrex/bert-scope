The longitudinal strengthening rods are identified as high, sharp ridges, supported by low-angled buttresses. The periderm ultrastructure consists of a dense network of short rods. The research provides insights into the skeletal structure and secretion process of the graptolite zooid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
