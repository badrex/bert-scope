Growth hormone-treated trout foraged closer to the water surface, resumed feeding earlier, and ate more food than control trout, increasing their susceptibility to aerial predation. This suggests that growth hormone transgenic fish may pose a threat to wild fish populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Endocrinology"}
