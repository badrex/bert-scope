They discovered that by inserting a plate of glass into a hollow glass prism filled with a highly refractive liquid, they could create interference bands. These bands were caused by the difference in retardation between the light passing through the thicker and thinner parts of the prism. The study also revealed that the bands were due to the interference of the two oppositely polarized pencils of light. This research provided valuable insights into the wave theory of light and the formation of spectral bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
