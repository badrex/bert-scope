He collected data on the daily urine and perspiration of himself and others, as well as the temperature using a thermometer. He found that the changes in excretions were influenced by the weather and that the mean diurnal and nocturnal perspiration were more equal during colder months. This research aimed to understand how the human body reacts to different weather conditions and improve overall health.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Human physiology"}
