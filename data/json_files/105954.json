He identifies the medal as being from Tarsus, the capital of Cilicia, and suggests that it was dedicated to Jupiter Tarsensis. The medal features a lion attacking a stag and has Phoenician words \"BAAL TARZ\" or \"BAAL TARS,\" which translates to \"Jupiter Tarsensis.\" Swinton provides a detailed analysis of the medal's design and inscriptions, offering insights into the Phoenician culture and history.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
