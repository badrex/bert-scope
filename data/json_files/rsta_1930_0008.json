By analyzing the periods and amplitudes of microseisms, the author explains their relationship with weather disturbances and proposes a new method for forecasting storms and the advance of the monsoon. This research provides valuable information for meteorologists and seismologists.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
