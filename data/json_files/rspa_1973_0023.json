They find that a radially compressed valence-shell form factor provides an excellent fit using Kubic Harmonics. The study also confirms previous estimates of anharmonic force constants and measures X-ray Debye temperatures for silicon at different temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
