They discovered three different modifications of monochloracetic acid and established three supersolubility curves and four solubility curves for the mixtures. The research showed that each modification of a polymorphous substance has a unique temperature for spontaneous crystallization in its mixtures with another substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
