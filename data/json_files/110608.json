{"article_id": "110608", "revised_title": "Improving the Manufacturing Process of Sulphuric Acid", "semantic_tags": ["Chemistry", "Acid-Base Chemistry", "Chemical Equilibrium", "Gas Laws", "Chemical Engineering"], "tldr": "The author investigates the relationship between the concentration of sulfuric acid and its affinity for water, aiming to improve the process of manufacturing sulfuric acid. The study also suggests that the obstruction to water evaporation in the open atmosphere is due to pressure rather than chemical affinity between the vapor and atmospheric air. The author proposes improvements in the manufacturing process, such as the regulated admission of steam into condensing chambers at constant high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Chemistry"}
