The authors analyze the data from anemograph records and barometer observations to determine the land and sea breezes' influence on these variations. They also discuss the double diurnal variation in the general movements of the atmosphere and its impact on weather predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
