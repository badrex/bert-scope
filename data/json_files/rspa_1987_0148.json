This transformation allows for a simpler representation of planetary magnetic fields using a set of five dipoles, improving the understanding and modeling of these fields. The method is demonstrated using the jovian magnetic field, showing a good agreement with the original model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
