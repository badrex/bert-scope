Simpson, discusses the benefits of taking the mean of multiple observations in practical astronomy to reduce errors caused by imperfect instruments and human observation. He presents a mathematical approach to calculate the probability of errors and demonstrates that using the mean of several observations significantly improves accuracy compared to relying on a single observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
