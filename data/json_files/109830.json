Oxyiodine has various chemical properties, such as decomposing into iodine and oxygen under heat and reacting with water to form oxyiodic acid. It also acts on metals, forming insoluble precipitates and combining with acids to create new compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
