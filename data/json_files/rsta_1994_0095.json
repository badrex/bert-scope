This theory enables the analysis of correlation dimension in Gaussian processes through spectral methods. The study re-examines the behavior of Gaussian power-law colored noise and demonstrates that the finite correlation dimension observed by previous researchers is a local quantity due to the non-ergodicity of the simulation model.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
