The authors argue that these particles could play a significant role in the deposition process, similar to the wet deposition process in the atmosphere. They discuss the importance of understanding the dynamics of nepheloid layers and the potential impact of particulate rain on sediment transport in the deep sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
