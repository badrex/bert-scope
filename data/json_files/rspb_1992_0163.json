They found that a combination of both subunits is required to form detectable GABA-activated chloride channels. These channels were blocked by bicuculline and potentiated by pentobarbitone. The study highlights the importance of subunit interactions in the formation of functional GABAa receptors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
