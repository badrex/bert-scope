The research focuses on internode length and how it affects the movement of shoot axes. The authors found that internode length is more sensitive to environmental factors than the birth rate of modules. Factors affecting internode length include the number and proximity of roots, shoot axis maturity, soil temperature, and other environmental variables. White clover moves through pastures by clonal growth, with an average movement of 13.3 cm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Ecology"}
