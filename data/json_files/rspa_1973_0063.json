They proposed a mechanism for vibrational relaxation and determined the average amount of energy removed per collision for mixtures of buffer gas and anthracene. The pressure dependence of the triplet yield upon excitation of anthracene at 347 nm was also investigated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
