They used two different methods to measure the atomic weight and found that the results agreed closely. The author faced challenges due to thallium's high position in the atomic weight scale and its tendency to oxidize. The research involved accurate weighing, precise glassware, and a vacuum to minimize errors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
