They found that the rate of oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide is proportional to the ethylene pressure and the first power of the concentration of adsorbed oxygen, while the rate of direct oxidation of ethylene to carbon dioxide is proportional to the ethylene pressure and the square of the adsorbed oxygen concentration. These results confirm the main steps in the reactions, which involve chemisorption of oxygen, reaction of gaseous or weakly adsorbed ethylene with oxygen, and isomerization of ethylene oxide to acetaldehyde followed by rapid oxidation to carbon dioxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
