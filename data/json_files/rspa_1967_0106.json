They introduce the concept of stability in epidemic processes and discuss the role of information retrieval processes in facilitating effective contact between susceptibles and infectives. The authors also apply Pontryagin's maximum principle to achieve optimal control of epidemic processes and establish the relationship between stability in epidemic processes and Lyapunov stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Communication Studies"}
