They discover that muscle fibers consist of two types of substances: a dim, ground substance and bright, rod-like particles called muscle-rods. The muscle-rods play a crucial role in muscle contraction, and their arrangement and form determine the appearance of the muscle fibers. The author also investigates the effects of polarized light on muscle fibers and concludes that the entire muscular fiber is anisotropous, except for the muscle-rods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
