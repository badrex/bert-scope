The study extends the Rayleigh model and maintains the Markovian assumption, allowing for a more accurate representation of the interactions between the piston and its environment. The results show that the equilibrium distribution function is not strictly Gaussian, but remains symmetrical in velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
