This technique uses high-power gas-filled flash discharge tubes to create a high concentration of free radicals, allowing for the use of absorption spectroscopy to investigate their reactions. The method is particularly useful for studying the chemistry of intermediate compounds and provides a powerful tool for understanding the behavior of free radicals in photochemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
