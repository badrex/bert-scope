The theory suggests that butterflies would have a selective advantage in flying at a constant angle to the sun, leading to changes in flight direction based on temperature gradients. The author tested this theory on Pieris rapae and P. brassicae, predicting and observing their flight directions in accordance with the theory. This new theory challenges the existing concepts of butterfly migration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
