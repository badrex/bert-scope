The author explains how the axonal cytoskeleton is assembled in the perikaryon and moves within the axon, providing for its renewal and the capacity of the axon to regenerate after injury. The study also explores the differences between axonal elongation and the locomotion of other migratory cell types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
