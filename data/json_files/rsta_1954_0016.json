The authors derive two independent dynamical relations between correlations from the Navier-Stokes equation and discuss the decay of isotropic turbulence at large Reynolds numbers. They also analyze energy transfer in large eddies, concluding that the large eddies are not permanent during decay, which is inconsistent with previous theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
