He assumes the aether to be a continuous, homogeneous, and incompressible medium with inertia and rotational elasticity. Larmor's theory provides a foundation for the electrodynamic laws and explains the relations between radiation and moving matter. The article also discusses the mechanical forces acting on matter in bulk and the mechanical constitution of a molecule."}
