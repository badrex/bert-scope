The results showed that neither the rhythm of the beating heart nor the excitability of the motor nerve was affected by increased atmospheric pressure. Additionally, magnetization did not affect the internal friction of torsionally vibrating iron or steel wires when deformations were small.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
