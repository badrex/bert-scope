They demonstrate how the orientation of molecules in a crystal can be determined using diamagnetic susceptibilities and X-ray diffraction data. This method provides valuable information about the shape and orientation of molecules within a crystal lattice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
