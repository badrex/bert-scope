The author, W. N. Hartley, explains how overexposure can cause strong lines to appear reversed and provides examples of this effect. He also suggests that this phenomenon is important for those studying solar physics and recommends using comparative exposures to confirm the accuracy of observations made using photographic representations of spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
