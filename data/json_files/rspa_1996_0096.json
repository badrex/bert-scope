It examines a chemical system with two reaction regions coupled via a linear diffusive interchange of a chemical species. The study focuses on the behavior of an excitable and a non-excitable reaction mechanism, and the effects of coupling them together.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Oscillators"}
