The author explores the instability of reacting gases with respect to wave motion and the development of transverse shocks from large amplitude acoustic waves in the reaction zone. The findings provide an explanation for the transverse acoustic waves and the spin phenomenon in detonation waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
