They found that extracts from urine of pregnant women and anterior pituitary tissue could induce ovulation in rabbits. The study also showed that a corpus luteum develops automatically after ovulation, indicating that a second stimulus, previously thought to be dependent on copulation, is not necessary for corpus luteum formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
