They derive the free-induction and spin-echo amplitudes for spins 1, 1/2, and S, and discuss the correspondence between the modulation patterns on these signals and the splitting and shift effects in steady resonance experiments. This study helps in understanding the components of the field-gradient tensor and the orientation of the crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Magnetic Resonance"}
