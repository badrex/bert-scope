They discovered that the amount of disturbance is not directly related to the amount of iron present, and that the magnetic susceptibility of rocks plays a significant role in the disturbances. The study aimed to determine the origin of local magnetic disturbances and their connection with iron-ore deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
