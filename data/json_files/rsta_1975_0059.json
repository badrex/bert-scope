Using reflexion seismic techniques and data from boreholes, the author reconstructs the palaeodrainage pattern of the river and discusses the relationship between the drainage system and tectonic patterns in the area. Evidence for the existence of a Late Pleistocene ice-sheet and its potential impact on the drainage system is also presented.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
