They discovered that the resistance increases as the square of the magnetic field, and in strong fields, it approaches a linear law. The author's hypothesis suggests that the disturbance produced by the structural imperfection of the lattice increases the specific resistance of an ideal metal by a value called the \"additional resistance.\" This research supports the idea of supra-conductivity and provides insight into the behavior of metals under extreme conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
