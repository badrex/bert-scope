The research reveals various skeletal abnormalities and anaemia in Ts heterozygous mice, which can be traced back to deficiencies in blood islands in the yolk sac of 8-day embryos. The primary effect of the gene is suggested to be anaemia, which leads to differential retardation of various organs and results in the observed abnormalities."}
