They discovered four types of visual pigment spectra with absorbance peaks at different wavelengths, providing insights into the variation of color vision in humans. The study also found differences in the red-sensitive cones of two subjects, which could impact their relative sensitivities to long-wave fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Color Perception"}
