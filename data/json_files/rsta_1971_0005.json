The authors find that these areas have distinct petrologic contrasts, with transform fault zones containing more plutonic and metamorphic rocks than adjacent ridge crests. The study suggests that fracture zones may provide a window into the deeper zones of the oceanic crust, revealing the composition of the lower crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
