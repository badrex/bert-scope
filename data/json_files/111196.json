He discovers that spermatozoa can penetrate the egg's outer layers and that their direct application to the egg's surface can lead to successful fertilization. Newport also examines the motion of spermatozoa and their relationship to their function, suggesting that their movement is an essential part of the fertilization process. He concludes that the spermatozoon's primary function is not just the addition of its substance to the egg but the application of a force or dynamic power that leads to fertilization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
