It discusses the dimensions of the basin, the proportion of new mafic and relict sialic rocks, and the possible causes of back-arc spreading within a global framework. The study also addresses the tectonic history of the region before and after the development of the back-arc basin.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
