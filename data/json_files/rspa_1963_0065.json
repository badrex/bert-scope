During the Earth's passage through a comet, a high-density region is created, and a downward jet of cometary material forms. The high temperatures within the jet vaporize most materials, and the most refractory substances form tektites. This theory explains the distribution of tektite fields and their formation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Astronomy"}
