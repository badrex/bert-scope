He demonstrates that every muscle is supplied with two nerves of different properties and that these nerves are essential for the brain to govern the muscular frame. The nervous circle allows the brain to receive information about the state and degree of muscle action, while the will's influence is conveyed to the muscle through motive nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
