It explains how gastrin stimulates gastric acid secretion and how the vagal nerve supply potentiates its release and action on the oxyntic cell. The article also describes the isolation and identification of gastrin peptides from various species and their diverse physiological actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
