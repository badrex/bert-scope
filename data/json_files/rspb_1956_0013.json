They discovered that repetitive stimulation enhances the action potential in nerves conducting at velocities less than 1.1 m/s. This phenomenon, called post-tetanic enhancement, is caused by hyperpolarization of the nerve after repetitive excitation. The authors suggest that this property is common to all mammalian non-myelinated nerve fibers and is responsible for post-tetanic facilitation in junctional tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
