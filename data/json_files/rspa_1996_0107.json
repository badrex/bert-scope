The authors use numerical simulations to study the interaction between the dynamics and chemistry of a reactive gas mixture, leading to the formation of quasi-steady structures, such as weak detonations and fast flames. These findings contribute to the understanding of detonation initiation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
