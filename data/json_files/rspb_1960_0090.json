The research shows that these processes are interconnected, with photosynthesis providing the energy required for nitrogen assimilation. The findings contribute to our understanding of how these algae convert light energy and nitrogen into organic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
