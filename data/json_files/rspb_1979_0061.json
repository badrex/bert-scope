The researchers found that nerve 6 contains two motoneurons that innervate neck muscles and sensory neurons that innervate hairs on the head. Nerve 7 contains sensory neurons from the labium's submentum and two neurons that innervate the salivary gland. The study suggests that these neuronal pathways control head movements during chewing and coordinate salivation with chewing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Invertebrate Neurobiology"}
