He demonstrates that both types of electricity exhibit attractions and repulsions, and produce magnetic phenomena, chemical decompositions, and physiological effects. Faraday also examines the electrical phenomena of magneto-electricity and compares them to those of voltaic electricity. He suggests that the power of chemical decomposition is directly proportional to the quantity of transmitted electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
