They found that the flow rate, heat current, and pressures at different points were dependent on the pressure difference. The flow was observed to be pressure-dependent and turbulent in nature, with the flow rate increasing as the pressure difference increased. The results showed a significant difference in behavior compared to flow through smooth channels, indicating that the flow through compressed powder is not frictionless.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
