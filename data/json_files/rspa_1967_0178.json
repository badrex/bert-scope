They observed a new system of absorption bands and performed a rotational analysis of the 0-0 band, leading to the ground state molecular structure. The study provides insights into the electronic transitions and molecular geometry of the radical.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
