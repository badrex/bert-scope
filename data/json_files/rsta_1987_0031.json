The enzymes can be used to replace chlorine-based oxidizing agents in pulp bleaching, reduce brightness reversion and increase mechanical pulp strength. Additionally, they can help in the degradation of pollutants such as dioxin and DDT, and enhance the utility of kraft lignin and lignosulphonates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biotechnology"}
