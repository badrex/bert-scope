The author derives inequalities involving the dispersion and expectations of operators and their commutators, providing a stronger version of the Heisenberg inequality. The results are applicable to any vector in Hilbert space and three self-adjoint linear operators.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra and Operator Theory"}
