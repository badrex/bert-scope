The results confirm the theoretical relation derived by Chandrasekhar, showing that the critical Rayleigh number for the onset of instability is affected by the magnetic field. The findings have implications for understanding thermal instability in astrophysical and geophysical contexts where both rotation and magnetic fields are present.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
