The authors conducted experiments with a horizontal channel and a planing plate to observe the formation of smooth and broken undular jumps. They found that the boundary between these two types of jumps occurs at a specific Froude number, and that Rayleigh's classical theory provides a fair approximation to the mean depth in undular trains of waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
