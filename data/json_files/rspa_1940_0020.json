The authors find strong positive adsorption over the entire range of concentrations, which contradicts the generally accepted theory based on the Gibbs theorem. They also discuss the importance of the submerged double layer in determining and modifying surface tension in dilute solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
