They develop a transformation to simplify the functional integral and expand the evaluation in terms of the coupling constants. The method is applicable to both strong and weak coupling constants and can be used as a basis for a covariant intermediate coupling approach to the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
