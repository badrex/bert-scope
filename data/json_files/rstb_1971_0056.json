It explores the role of enzymes, cell organelles, and proteins in the process, as well as the concept of exocytosis in releasing neurotransmitters. The author emphasizes the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration between physiologists, biochemists, and cytologists to understand the complex mechanisms of synaptic transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
