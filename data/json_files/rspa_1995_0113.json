It addresses errors in the original text, including incorrect equations and references, and offers corrected versions of the affected sections. The article also presents a new upper bound for the auxiliary function in a related model of diffusive crack initiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
