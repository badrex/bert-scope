This substance possesses the characteristic properties of tannin, such as precipitating gelatine and converting animal skins into leather. The author also found that this artificial tannin can be produced from vegetable, mineral, and animal coal, expanding the potential applications for leather production.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
