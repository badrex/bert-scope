The authors present probabilistic formulas for characterizing statistically significant sequence configurations and provide applications for detecting interesting regions in protein sequences, such as charge clusters, hydrophobic sections, and regions prone to modifications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
