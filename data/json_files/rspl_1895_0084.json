The authors, A. M. Worthington and R. S. Cole, captured 158 photographs of various splashes to analyze the formation of concentric ripples and the behavior of impacts with different objects, such as smooth, rough, or wet spheres. The authors hope that their findings will spark further investigation into fluid motion and the underlying phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
