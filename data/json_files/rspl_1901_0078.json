The results showed that exposure to liquid air had little effect on the bacillus's vitality but slightly modified its virulence. The study also found that the length of exposure did not impact the results and that immersion in liquid air did not produce different outcomes than simple exposure to its temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
