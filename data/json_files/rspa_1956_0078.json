They show that for large nuclear separations, these equations become the Hartree-Fock equations for appropriate valence states of separated atoms. An electrostatic interpretation of chemical bonding is introduced using optimum paired-electron orbital functions, and numerical computations by the electrostatic method are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
