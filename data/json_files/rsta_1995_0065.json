It discusses the impact of changes in water vapor flux convergence and precipitation minus evaporation on river runoff, ocean density, and sea ice production. The study also explores the potential effects of anthropogenic greenhouse warming on the Arctic atmosphere and moisture budget.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
