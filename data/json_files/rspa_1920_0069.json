They find that the addition of a large quantity of one element to a source containing a small quantity of another element does not cause the expected changes in the spectra, suggesting that temporary associations of atoms, in a chemical sense, are not responsible for the phenomena. The study also examines the mutual influence of hydrogen and helium atoms on each other, providing insights into the electric fields and resolutions produced by the proximity of charged particles of the same kind.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
