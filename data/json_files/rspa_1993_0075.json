They found that at low energies, the fullerene molecules reflect off the surface with little deformation, while at higher energies, the molecules can disintegrate on impact, causing sputtering and implantation of denser amorphous carbon beneath the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
