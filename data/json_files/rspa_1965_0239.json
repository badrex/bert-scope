It outlines the attenuation of solar radiation by different absorption processes, such as resonance transitions, direct dissociation and ionization, predissociation, and preionization. The article also reviews the available data for absorption cross sections of various species in the atmosphere and provides insights into the absorption continua of oxygen and nitrogen, which control the absorption processes between 100 and 400 km. The solar radiation spectrum and its intensity measurements are also discussed, highlighting the need for high-resolution studies of the complex oxygen and nitrogen spectra in the far ultraviolet region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
