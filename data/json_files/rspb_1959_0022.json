The research also reveals that mitochondria in newborn liver cells have a low population, which rapidly increases in step with respiratory activity. This understanding can help explain the liver's adaptation to the newborn animal's changing environment and its role in survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
