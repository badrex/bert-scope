The authors explore the direction of the transition moment of the carbonyl band of the peptide group and how it is influenced by mechanical interaction and orbital-following effects. They also mention the importance of X-ray analysis in studying the structure of proteins, using the example of haemoglobin molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
