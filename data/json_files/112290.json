By finding an integral of one equation, he demonstrates a procedure to either solve a single differential equation or find an integral of a single partial differential equation. This approach reduces the complexity of the original system and provides a more efficient way to find the common integral.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
