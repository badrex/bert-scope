The study supports the hypothesis that morphology is represented autonomously in both the semantic and lexical components of the system. Damage to these representations can result in morphological errors in transcoding tasks, and the co-occurrence of morphological and phonemic errors can be accounted for by several hypotheses, although their theoretical meaning remains uncertain.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Neuropsychology"}
