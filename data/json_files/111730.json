They find that sulfur's melting point changes when it transforms between different crystal structures, and that the presence of a viscous form of sulfur can affect the melting point. This research sheds light on the complex nature of sulfur and its various forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography and Solid State Chemistry"}
