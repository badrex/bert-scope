In a population of the ant acervorum, monogynous colonies produced a female-biased sex ratio, while polygynous colonies produced a male-biased sex ratio. The findings suggest that split sex ratios in L. acervorum stem from two processes: workers' response to the variation in relatedness asymmetry caused by variable queen numbers and sex-ratio compensation by monogynous colonies for male-biased production in polygynous colonies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
