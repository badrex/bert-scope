He explains the effects of different combinations of metals and fluids, and how chemical changes restore equilibrium. Davy also explores the accumulation of electricity in voltaic arrangements and the reactions that occur when the circuit is broken or changed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
