They compare the helical deformation of Love and the localized solution of Coin, identifying the energetically preferred mode, which switches from the helix to the localized mode early in the post-buckling range. The authors also predict dynamic jumps observed under various dead and rigid loading processes, leading to the writhing state. This research has implications for understanding the localization of buckling patterns in thin shells and offers insights into spatial localization in the nonlinear post-buckling of thin rods.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
