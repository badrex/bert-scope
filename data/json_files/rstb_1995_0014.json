The authors describe the mechanism of methyl-directed mismatch excision repair in bacteria and its homologous system in human cells. They also explain how defects in the mismatch repair system can lead to increased mutability and a predisposition to tumor development in certain tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
