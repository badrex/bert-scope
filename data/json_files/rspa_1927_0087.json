The authors found that the reaction is homogeneous and can be explained by a combination of unimolecular and bimolecular processes. The rate of reaction depends on the initial pressure of the dimethyl ether, with the reaction becoming more bimolecular at lower pressures. The authors also studied the influence of various gases, such as hydrogen, carbon monoxide, and nitrogen, on the reaction rate and found that hydrogen has a unique effect on the reaction, while other gases have no significant influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
