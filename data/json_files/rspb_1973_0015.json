Both moths store toxic substances in their bodies, making them unpalatable to predators. The research also discusses the relationship between Ctenuchid and Arctiidae moths and their preference for food plants containing cardiac glycosides or pyrrolizidine alkaloids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
