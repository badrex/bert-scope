They discovered that the main reaction can be represented by the equation 2CO \u2192 C + CO2. The authors also found that formaldehyde synthesis occurs when hydrogen molecules combine with carbon monoxide, which is different from the ammonia synthesis that requires a metal catalyst. This research helps to understand the behavior of molecules and atoms during electron collision and their subsequent reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reaction kinetics"}
