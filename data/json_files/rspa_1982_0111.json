The research examines coastal deposits' ages through radiocarbon dating of mollusk shells and barnacle plates to reconstruct the pattern of deformation over the last 35,000 years. The findings reveal a resultant slip vector for the last 7,000 years of 29 mm/year, with the Musandam Peninsula subsiding towards the north and east. The study also highlights the contrast between the tectonic stability of the lower Mesopotamian plains and the coast of eastern Saudi Arabia and the extensive normal faulting and some strike-slip faulting in the western Makran during the last 35,000 years.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
