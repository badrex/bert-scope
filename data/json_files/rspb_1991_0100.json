The p53 gene has suppressor and promoter functions in cell growth control, and its protein can adopt two conformations, which may be influenced by temperature and mutations. Different mutations affect the conformational equilibrium of the p53 protein, leading to various outcomes in tumor cell growth. Understanding these conformational changes can help in the therapeutic management of cancer cell growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
