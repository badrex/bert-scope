They found that the ratio of IFN-a to IFN-P transcripts varied greatly depending on the cell type. The levels of individual IFN-a RNAs were also very different, with IFN-a1, -a2, and -a4 RNAs constituting the major fraction of the IFN-a transcripts. The study revealed striking differences in the proportion of individual IFN-a mRNA species in different cell types, particularly between normal and leukaemic cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
