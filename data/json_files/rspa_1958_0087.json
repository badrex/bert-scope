They used a novel method to measure the absolute intensity of vacuum ultra-violet radiation using a fluorescent converter, photomultiplier, and scaler. The results showed that dissociation losses account for a large part of the energy balance, and the rate of dissociation of molecular hydrogen in an electrodeless discharge was measured by absorbing the atomic hydrogen formed and observing the rate of decrease of gas pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
