It explores the evolution of a remnant's X-ray emission, possible emission mechanisms, and investigates the structure and spectrum of various supernova remnants, such as the Crab Nebula, Cassiopeia A, and Puppis A. The article also examines the gas column density of the interstellar medium and its relation to X-ray emission.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
