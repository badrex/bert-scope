They demonstrate that temperature coefficients of adsorption and chemical reactions can mask the electronic properties of the material, leading to anomalous values for the work function and emission constant. The study provides a new interpretation of Richardson plots for composite surfaces and highlights the importance of considering temperature variations in surface equilibrium when analyzing thermionic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
