The meteor appeared as a dark column extending from the northwest to the zenith, with a pale yellow hue and black edges. It was visible for about 45 minutes before dissipating. The phenomenon was likely a water spout, and its appearance made a significant impression on the local population. A storm of rain and hail followed the meteor, which continued for two hours the next morning.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
