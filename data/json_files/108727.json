The process involved treating bromide of ethylene and propylene with cyanide of potassium, followed by further chemical reactions. This method provided a more understandable and productive process for obtaining these complex organic acids. The research also explored the potential for similar reactions to create other homologues of succinic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
