They found that the cells grow in a longitudinal direction and eventually form auxospores to counteract the decrease of cell size. The author also discussed the culture methods used and observed the variability in diatom shapes within pure lines. This research contributes to our understanding of diatoms' importance as food in the sea and their role in marine biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
