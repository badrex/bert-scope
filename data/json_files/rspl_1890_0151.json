They mention that the velocity for a vacuum is multiplied by the ratio of electric units in vacuum, agreeing with von Helmholtz's result. The author also highlights the limitations of electrodynamics within Maxwell's scheme and the importance of inductive capacity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
