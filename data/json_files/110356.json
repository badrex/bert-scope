He discovered that soft iron can retain its magnetism even after the electric current is stopped. The retention of magnetism depends on the unbroken contact between the ends of the horseshoe and its keeper. Watkins concluded that the phenomenon of the permanency of magnetism in soft iron can be explained as a case of complex induction between the soft iron horseshoe and the keeper.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
