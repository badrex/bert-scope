They consider exchange effects for all transitions between states involving the 1s and 2s, 2p levels. The calculations are carried out for various nuclear charge numbers, and the results can be used to estimate cross-sections for elastic and inelastic transitions in more complex highly ionized atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
