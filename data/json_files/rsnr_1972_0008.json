It highlights his support for theories that could be understood and tested, such as the Gamow-Gurney-Condon theory of decay and the prediction of Chadwick's experiment. Rutherford's strong authority and influence on the scientific community are also illustrated through anecdotes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
