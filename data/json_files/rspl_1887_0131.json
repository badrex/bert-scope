It traces the splanchnic origin of the heart, the formation of the mesocardium, and the course of the omphalomesenteric veins to the heart. The development of a septum, the septum transversum, and the formation of the ventral diaphragm between the liver and the heart are also discussed. The article also covers the appearance of other somatic veins, the infolding of the somatopleure and splanchnopleure, and the development of the umbilical veins and placenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
