They found no traces of protozoic life in any of the experiments, leading to the conclusion that no protozoa can be cultivated from healthy living tissues, malignant tumors, lesions of vaccinia and molluscum contagiosum, salamander's pancreas, and frog muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Research"}
