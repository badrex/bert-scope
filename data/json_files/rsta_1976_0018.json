They suggest that the approach to the modern tectonic regime became evident around one billion years ago. The study of metamorphic patterns from Brazil provides evidence for a substantial reduction in thermal gradients over the Proterozoic period. The authors propose that the reduction of radioactive heat production near the Archaean-Proterozoic boundary led to the thickening of stable granitoid crust and the formation of supercontinents. They emphasize the importance of large-scale crust-mantle mixing caused by subduction, crustal basement uplift, and weathering processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
