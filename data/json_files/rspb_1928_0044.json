They discovered that the rate of action of the oxidation-reduction mechanism is conditioned by the availability of acceptors for oxygen and hydrogen, and that the fermentation process can cause rapid death of the microorganisms. The experiment shows that hydrogen appears later in the fermentation than carbon dioxide, and that the fermentation of glucose can be divided into two phases: the first phase produces alcohol, formic acid, and succinic acid, while the second phase involves the decomposition of a non-reducing material that was synthesized in the first phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
