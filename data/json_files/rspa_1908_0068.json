After examining the heavier portions of gas remaining after fractional distillation of 120 tons of air, no positive results were found. It is concluded that if such gases exist, they must be found in the atmosphere, and they are either unstable or do not exist at all.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
