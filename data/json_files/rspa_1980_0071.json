The author, A.H. Cottrell, describes the research conducted on dislocations, their interactions with foreign atoms, and their role in the strength and plasticity of metals. The article also highlights the discovery of the yield point in structural steel and its explanation through the pinning of dislocations by segregated atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
