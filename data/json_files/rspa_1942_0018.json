They discovered that the atomic lattice of mild steel possesses a 'yield point' where the lattice spacing undergoes an abrupt expansion. This expansion is permanent and increases as the stress applied to the specimen increases, revealing a new mechanical property of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
