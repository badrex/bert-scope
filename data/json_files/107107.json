The membrana tympani can be injured by various causes, such as inflammation, external violence, or attempts to remove foreign objects. The author explains that deafness can occur when the Eustachian tube is obstructed, and he suggests puncturing the membrana tympani as a possible solution. This operation has shown promise in treating deafness caused by various factors, such as common colds, scarlet fever, venereal ulcers, and blood extravasation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Otolaryngology"}
