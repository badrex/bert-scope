It examines the dynamic and static response characteristics of various building shapes and explores the integration of meteorological factors, aerodynamic factors, and structural response characteristics in predicting the overall response of buildings to wind.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Wind Engineering"}
