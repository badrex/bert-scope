It discusses the use of linear elastic fracture mechanics and its extensions to non-linear materials, as well as the role of fracture parameters in characterizing materials and predicting their behavior under different conditions. The article also highlights the importance of understanding time-dependent and environmental factors, such as creep and fatigue, in the design of non-metallic structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
