Waller, conducted experiments to study the composition of steam and cloud vapors. He observed that the opaque vapors of condensed steam consist of minute globules or spherules of water, contrary to the generally accepted theory that they consist of small vesicles. Waller used a microscope to examine the globules and found them to be perfectly spherical, like shot or the globules of mercury. He also described various appearances presented under different circumstances and with different oily fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
