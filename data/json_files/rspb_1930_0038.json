They describe the extraction and preparation of these components from yeast and their role in the oxidation and reduction of cytochrome within living cells. The study provides insights into the respiratory mechanisms of cells and the behavior of oxidase and cytochrome in both artificial and living systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
