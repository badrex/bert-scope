They found that the presence of neutral salts can change the color exhibited by indicators in a solution, and this change can provide information about the dissociation of the indicator and other substances in the presence of neutral salts. The study focused on methyl orange as an indicator and used a photoelectric cell and an optical wedge to measure the absorption of light by the solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
