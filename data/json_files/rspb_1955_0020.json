The research shows that antibodies from immune rat serum can pass into the circulation of young rats up to 18 days old, while the capacity to absorb antibodies from the gut decreases rapidly after 21 days. The findings also reveal that antibodies from immune sera prepared in mice and rabbits enter the circulation of young rats, but those from cows and fowl do not. This research provides insights into the transfer of passive immunity in rats and the selectivity of the gut in admitting antibodies from different species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
