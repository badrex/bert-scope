The researchers found three main types of immature megakaryocytes, with varying nuclear lobes and cytoplasmic characteristics. The findings suggest that megakaryocytes possess a lobulated nucleus and show cytoplasmic differentiation from the time of their first endomitosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
