It shows that lactation can be prolonged indefinitely by providing a succession of young foster litters, leading to a steady state of milk production. The suckling stimulus also affects the oestrous cycle, causing a prolongation of the cycle length. The research also explores the possibility of restarting lactation after weaning and the impact of mating on lactation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
