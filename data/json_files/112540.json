They discuss the transfer of momentum during collisions and how compressibility affects the distribution of velocity in the colliding bodies. The author also explains how discontinuity in the tendency to compression in different parts of a system can lead to the transmission of a finite amount of momentum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
