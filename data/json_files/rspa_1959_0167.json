They introduce a dynamically meaningful frame of reference and formulate a differential equation characterizing apparent angular motion. The study focuses on the behavior of light and celestial objects, providing a theoretical basis for describing observed phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
