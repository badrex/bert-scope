They identify an error in de Sitter's calculations and correct it, resulting in a more accurate determination of the mass of a system of particles. This correction aligns with the theory of the equivalent mass of a system of continuous matter developed by Tolman, Whittaker, and others.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
