The author concludes that while a liquid's stability relies on gravitation, a gaseous mass' stability is influenced by elasticity and rotation. The paper also discusses the potential division of a nebula into two smaller ones and the regaining of stability during cooling.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
