The milk teeth are rudimentary and functionless but are completely calcified and distinguishable from the permanent teeth. This discovery sheds light on the Aardvark's evolutionary and systematic position within the mammal family tree.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
