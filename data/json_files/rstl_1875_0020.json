They used a 6-inch refracting telescope and a spectroscope with a diffraction grating to study the sun's spectrum and the positions of prominences. The observations provided valuable data on the sun's structure and behavior, which could be used in conjunction with other researchers' work to better understand solar phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
