They discovered that the core effect, excited by the atomic resonance line, is extinguished by a trace of hydrogen, while the wing effect, caused by molecular or quasi-molecular absorption, can tolerate any amount of hydrogen. This distinction confirms the difference between the core and wing effects and supports the connection between the core effect and atomic absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
