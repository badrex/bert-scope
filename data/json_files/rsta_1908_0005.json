The author discusses the competing forces of gravitation and elasticity and explores the effects of initial stress and strain on the planet's stability. The study concludes that the Earth is currently stable, but suggests that a smaller resistance to compression in the past may have led to instability, leaving traces in the distribution of land and water on the planet's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
