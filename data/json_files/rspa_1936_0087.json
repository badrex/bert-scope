They found that even small amounts of impurities can significantly alter the resistance and temperature coefficient, leading to a better understanding of the complex behavior of these alloys. The results help explain the discrepancies in earlier research and provide insights into the role of impurities in bismuth alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
