The core is untwisted, and the vorticity is proportional to the distance from the axis of symmetry. The core rotates with a constant angular velocity, and the velocity of the ring is periodic. The average velocity is smaller than the velocity of a ring with a circular core of the same cross-sectional area. The findings show that among all motions with given impulse and core area, the steady motion has the greatest kinetic energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
