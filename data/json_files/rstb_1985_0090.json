It highlights the importance of refining the stratigraphical framework for better correlation and recognition of synchronous events. The transition from marine to non-marine environments and the colonization of terrestrial areas are also addressed. The article emphasizes the diachronism in the cessation of marine conditions and its impact on biotic evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
