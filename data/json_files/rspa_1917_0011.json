They used a well-insulated apparatus and controlled conditions to minimize errors and improve accuracy. This research provided a more precise measurement of water's heat of vaporization, which is essential for understanding heat transfer processes and industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
