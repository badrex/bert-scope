They discuss the experimental setup and results, showing that certain types of particles can cause ignition at low radiation fluxes, and propose that these particles, which are likely to be present around industrial plants, can contribute to the high rates of propagation of unconfined vapour cloud explosions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Explosion and Fire Safety"}
