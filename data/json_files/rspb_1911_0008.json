They discovered that temperature played a crucial role in the development of the phenomenon, with agglutination occurring more prominently at lower temperatures. The study also found that sera from infected animals could agglutinate both their own and other animals' red blood cells, indicating the presence of both auto- and iso-agglutinins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
