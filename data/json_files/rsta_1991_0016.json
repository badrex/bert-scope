The text covers the relationship between theory and experiment in marine fluid dynamics, the validation of experiments, and the dynamics of both rigid and flexible ships. The author also highlights the importance of technologies such as microprocessors, computers, mechatronics, and optoelectronics in the development of these modelling techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Marine Engineering"}
