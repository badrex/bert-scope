They mapped 61 of these mutants precisely and located the rest approximately. The results showed that the sites of mutation were spread evenly across the genetic map, with only a few gaps. The study confirmed previous predictions about the genetic code and the reading of the genetic message in triplets of bases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
