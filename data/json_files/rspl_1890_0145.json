The research shows a marked quantitative diminution of impulses leaving the spinal cord, localization of direct transmission in the posterior column, and the development of direct and indirect paths in the individual columns of the cord. The study also highlights the obstruction offered by the efferent region to the transmission of impulses through the center.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
