It examines various forms of activity, including plane waves, and how the propagation of activity depends on cell properties. The mass of cells can exhibit behavior similar to living organisms, demonstrating trial and error learning, conditioned responses, and the ability to regenerate past events.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
