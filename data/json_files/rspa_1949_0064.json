The deformation is attributed to the progressive gliding of lattice planes in two configurations, one stable and the other unstable. The author provides a detailed explanation of the crystal movements and the underlying molecular processes involved in the deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
