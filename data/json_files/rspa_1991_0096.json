They derive asymptotic expansions for the critical Frank-Kamenetskii parameter and use numerical schemes to determine numerical values for the coefficients in the expansions. The results are compared with numerical solutions of the perturbed problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Reactor Design"}
