The research found that mice breed throughout the year, with higher productivity rates in corn-ricks and average rates in flour depots and cold stores. Mice in cold stores can breed in cold environments with temperatures never more than 15\u00b0F all year round. The study also provides insights into the mice's weight, sex ratio, and pregnancy rates in various habitats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
