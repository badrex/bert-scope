The authors reevaluate previous findings and argue that the high reflexion coefficients estimated for low-lying strata require a radical revision of our understanding of long-distance wireless communication. They conclude that these low-lying strata play a minor role in ionospheric alternation and refraction, leaving our ideas concerning normal wireless transmission processes undisturbed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
