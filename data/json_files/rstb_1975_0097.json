These butterflies visit and feed on these plants to acquire alkaloid precursors that are later converted into chemicals used for courtship and territory marking. The study focuses on the 1971 Royal Society expedition to the New Hebrides, where researchers discovered that the plants attracting male Danainae contain the alkaloid lycopsamine, which is a precursor to the dihydropyrrolizine derivatives found on male butterflies' hairpencils.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
