It analyzes clean-off reactions and displacement reactions, explaining how the rate and reaction kinetics are controlled by the total perimeter of the boundaries. The authors provide theoretical analysis and compare it with experimental data available.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
