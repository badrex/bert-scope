The researchers found that the platypus' cortex has alternating stripes of cortex representing purely mechanical inputs and combined electrical and mechanical inputs. Bimodal units responded more vigorously to electrical stimulation and had small dynamic ranges, suggesting a mechanism for localization of stimuli. The findings provide insights into how the platypus uses its unique electroreceptive abilities to locate prey underwater.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
