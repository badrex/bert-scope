The main photo-ionization process is identified, and the photo-ionization cross-section is measured for free electron energies from 20 to about 20. The results are compared with calculations by Dalgarno, and the technique of photographic photometry in the 1100 to 1 region is explained.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
