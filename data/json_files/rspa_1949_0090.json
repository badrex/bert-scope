The research focuses on the vertical turbulent flux and the vertical gradients of water vapor and heat content, leading to the evaluation of eddy diffusivities for water vapor and heat. The findings demonstrate the modification of eddy diffusivity by thermal stratification and the relationship between eddy diffusivity, vertical wind shear, and vertical temperature gradient. The results have implications for understanding natural land evaporation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
