{"article_id": "rspa_1959_0009", "revised_title": "Radioactive Monolayer Diffusion and Reaction Products", "semantic_tags": ["Radioactivity", "Monolayers", "Diffusion", "Surface chemistry", "Nuclear reactions"], "tldr": "The authors studied the diffusion of reaction products from a radioactive monolayer. They found that the diffusion rate depends on the nature of the reaction products and the surrounding medium. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of radioactive materials on surfaces and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
