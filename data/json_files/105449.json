The author, George Edwards, provides a detailed description of the bird's appearance, including its unique eye-like spots on the feathers, colors, and physical features. The bird's skin and a drawing were sent from Canton to John Fothergill, and Edwards uses these materials to create a figure and description of the bird.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
