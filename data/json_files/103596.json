Despite having had smallpox before, she was infected again through direct contact with the gentleman's skin. This case study highlights the effectiveness of close application of variolous matter for infection transmission and the possibility of a person having had smallpox being infected again through inoculation. The study also notes the difference in infection time between direct contact and inoculation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Infectious Diseases"}
