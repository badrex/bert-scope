This new form consists of diagonal or quasi-diagonal blocks, where each block has a repeated eigenvalue and an isotropic eigenvector. This canonical form is useful in various applications, such as wave propagation in continuous media and gravitational fields in the general theory of relativity.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra"}
