The author measures systolic and diastolic blood pressures and estimates blood volume using the Riva Rocci method and Haldane's method. The results show a relationship between blood pressure and blood volume changes, and the author proposes a formula to explain this interdependence. The study also discusses the effects of nitrous oxide and oxygen anesthesia on blood concentration and the role of venous tone in circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
