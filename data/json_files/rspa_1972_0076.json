They found that the phonon spectra remain mostly unchanged, while the electronic spectra show significant changes during the phase transitions. The theory accounts for the observed behavior, including the splitting of the doubly degenerate phonon modes and the coupling between lattice displacements and electronic states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
