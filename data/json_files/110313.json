The author, Francis Baily, expands on the work of M. Bessel and conducts experiments with various spheres to determine the correct factor for the additional correction. Baily also highlights the need for further experiments and improvements in pendulum design to ensure accurate results for determining the length of the seconds pendulum and the figure of the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
