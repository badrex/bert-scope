The authors, A. L. Hodgkin and F. R. S., explore the effects of sodium ions on various tissues and how they contribute to the transmission of nerve impulses. They also compare the effects of different substances on nerve fibers, such as choline, sucrose, and other quarternary ammonium salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
