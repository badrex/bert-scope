The theory is illustrated by calculations made for a single crystal of sodium. The author discusses the differences in shape between surfaces belonging to different lattice planes and the potential of this phenomenon to be developed into a method of determining the elastic constants of crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
