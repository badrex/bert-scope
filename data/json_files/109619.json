He discovered that roasted vegetable substances can be converted into an artificial tanning substance through a series of chemical reactions. The study also explores the connection between tannin and coal formation, as well as the process of converting different types of coal into the tanning substance using nitric acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and processes"}
