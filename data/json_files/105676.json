He used a marked post to record the water levels and observed the rise and fall of the tides. Maskelyne found that the greatest rise and fall of the water was about 13 divisions of the post or 39 inches, and the smallest rise and fall was around 7 divisions or 20 inches. He also determined that the mean time of high water happened 2 hours and 15 minutes after the Moon's passing the meridian, though this interval varied due to the sun's influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
