He observed that sap flows from the upper to the lower part of an exogenous tree through continuous vessels. Rainey also noticed that when leaf-buds are active, separations occur between the cells of the bark and the wood, which he believes play a role in the propulsion of sap and the descent of the cambium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
