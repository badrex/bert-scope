The embryos develop a stalked placenta and are enclosed in an epithelial sac, which is attached to the oviduct wall. The embryos move along the oviduct as they grow, with each embryo occupying a fixed position until organ systems are fully formed. This unique mode of placentation and embryo movement is found in neotropical Onychophora and is similar to the mammalian yolk-sac placenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
