They calculate the energy shifts due to electromagnetic vacuum fluctuations and the dipole self-interaction of the atom, finding that the shifts are proportional to the atom's static polarizability. The results show how the energy shifts vary depending on the topology of the universe and the atom's position within it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Field Theory"}
