It explains how some tools used for understanding chaotic dynamics can still be applied in this situation and introduces the concept of a family of attractors depending on fluctuating parameters. The article also explores the determination of higher characteristic exponents and short-term predictions for the time evolution of these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
