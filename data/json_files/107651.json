They aimed to study the effects of different environments on the pendulum's behavior and to improve timekeeping and navigation methods. The experiments provided valuable insights into the factors affecting the accuracy of pendulum-based measurements and contributed to the understanding of geophysics and astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
