This new method allows for a more accurate comparison of resistances to air motion and verification of flow laws without needing an anemometer. The author constructs and tests the apparatus, demonstrating its potential for use in studying ventilation and airflow in various settings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
