He observes that the shells are filled with a black, heavy substance that resembles metal. Upon heating and examining the substance, he concludes that it is actually sulphur. He hypothesizes that the snails were once living creatures that became trapped in a mineral-rich environment, where they were exposed to subterranean heat and sulphur. Over time, the sulphur infiltrated the snail shells and turned them into a sulphur-rich substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
