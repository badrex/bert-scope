They found that nitromethane decomposes into methyl radicals and nitrogen dioxide, while methyl nitrite forms an isomer that reverts to the stable form. The decomposition mechanisms involve various reactions, including recombination, disproportionation, and isomerization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
