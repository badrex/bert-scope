The authors introduce local constitutive equations for the rate of change of contact forces, the evolution of contact normals, the mechanism of local failure, and the density of contacts in a particular class. The overall response of a two-dimensional assembly of discs subjected to an overall shearing deformation is determined, and the stress-strain relations and the evolution of fabric and contact forces are in qualitative agreement with the observed behavior of granular materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
