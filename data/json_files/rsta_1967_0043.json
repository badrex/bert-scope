It explores the effects of solar radiation pressure and atmospheric drag on satellite orbits, as well as the relationship between solar activity and the Earth's atmosphere. The author also examines the various types of atmospheric variations, such as diurnal and semi-annual variations, and the structure of the upper atmosphere, including its composition and temperature changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
