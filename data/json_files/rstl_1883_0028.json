This unique crinoid has five simple arms and two distinct features not found in other Neocrinoids: large basals that completely separate the centrodorsal from the radials and an anal appendage. These characteristics make Thaumatocrinus renovatus an important find in the study of crinoids and deep-sea life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
