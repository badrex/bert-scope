The observations showed that the phenomena presented by sunspots are not due to radiation from a source like the one indicated by M. Faye's theory. The absorption hypothesis offers a partial solution to the problem of sunspots, and further detailed spectroscopic examination of the sun's surface may bring more knowledge about its physical constitution.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
