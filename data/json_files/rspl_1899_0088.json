They propose that the cell plate arises indirectly from the spindle fibers and that the primary cell wall is different from the secondary formations that follow. The author also suggests that the cell wall is fundamentally a mucilage secretion, with droplets or spherules composed of a substance that can be either hydrated as mucilage or dehydrated as cellulose.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
