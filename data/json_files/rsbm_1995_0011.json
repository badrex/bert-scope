His early work on the Troodos Massif in Cyprus played a crucial role in the development of seafloor spreading theory and the understanding of the oceanic crust. Gass's research led to Troodos becoming a model for \"obducted\" oceanic crust and mantle, which is now recognized in many other parts of the world.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
