They found that the rate of nitrogen fixation was low in the early morning, but increased and remained high for several hours around mid-afternoon before decreasing. Temperature fluctuations and light intensity were identified as factors influencing these changes. The study provides insights into the physiological functioning of nodulated plants and their response to environmental factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
