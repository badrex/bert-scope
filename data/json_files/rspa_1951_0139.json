They found that all four deuteromethanes were produced in the reaction, with CD4 being the most abundant product. The adsorption of deuterium was stronger than methane adsorption. The activation energies for the production of deuteromethanes were determined, and the adsorption of methane on the catalyst had an activation energy of about 11 kcal/mol. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanism and the role of nickel catalysts in the exchange of CH4 and D2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
