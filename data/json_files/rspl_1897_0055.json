They discovered that metals like uranium, zinc, cadmium, and magnesium can cause a change on the plates even in complete darkness. The author also found that the action can pass through various materials like gelatine, celluloid, and parchment, and that different papers have varying levels of transparency to this action.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
