The poem, written by John Morfitt, expresses conservative views and anti-scientific sentiments, showing how science was seen as a threat to the established order and religious beliefs. The author argues that this distrust of science played a role in the riots against Priestley and sheds light on the attitudes that shaped the event.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
