He found that when the nerves are divided and the ends are not displaced, digestion occurs if the animal lives for some hours. However, if the ends of the nerves are turned from each other, no digestion takes place. The application of galvanism to the nerves can cause a degree of digestion in the food contained in the stomach, and the animal does not suffer from dyspnoea when galvanized.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
