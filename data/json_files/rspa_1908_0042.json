They found that the secondary radiation depends on the atomic weight of the element and discovered a portion of the secondary radiation follows the ordinary law of reflection. The authors also investigated the intensity of the radiation in different directions and at various angles of incidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
