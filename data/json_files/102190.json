Vincent's Solution to Dr. Papin's Water-Raising Engine", "semantic_tags": ["Fluid mechanics", "Engineering", "Pump design", "Clockwork", "Barbers' tools"], "tldr": "Dr. Nath. Vincent investigates Dr. Papin's water-raising engine and proposes a solution using a vessel shaped like a pair of bellows or barber's puffs. The vessel, filled with water, can be operated by clockwork to produce jets and circulate water through the system. This design could potentially improve the efficiency of the engine.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Pump design"}
