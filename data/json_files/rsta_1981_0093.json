The author explains the development of high voltage and high current pulse technology, which has allowed for the reconsideration of the Z-pinch to attain dense fusion plasmas. The plasma focus, which resembles a Z-pinch after three-dimensional compression, has shown the potential for enhanced stability properties and high neutron yields. The article also explores other phenomena associated with the neutron emission, such as electron and ion beams, turbulence, and isotropic neutron production.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
