The research finds that the presence of particles increases the maximum flow-deflection angle and alters the flow quantities, such as pressure, temperature, and velocity. The analysis also reveals the formation of a pure-gas region along the wall surface and the effect of gas-particle interactions on the flow structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
