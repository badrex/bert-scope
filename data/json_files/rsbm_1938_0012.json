He discovered that high-vacuum tubes could emit X-rays, which he later used to create the first X-ray tube. Jackson also conducted extensive research on detergents, weathering of stones, and chemical reactions. His work in these areas helped improve laundry practices and the preservation of historical buildings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical research"}
