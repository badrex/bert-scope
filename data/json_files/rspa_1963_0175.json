They developed equations to show how perigee distance, orbital period, and eccentricity vary with time. The results can be used to determine the lifetime and air density at perigee, and are applicable to orbits with perigee heights between 150 and 1000 km.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Space Technology"}
