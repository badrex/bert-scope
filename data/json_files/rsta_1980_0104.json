The study finds that these impurities reduce the cohesive strength of prior austenite grain boundaries, promoting intergranular embrittlement. The research also highlights the importance of grain refinement and microstructure control in preventing embrittlement and improving material properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
