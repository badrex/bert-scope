The method allows for a more efficient calculation of a ship's stability, taking into account the center of buoyancy and the metacentre. This new approach can be used by anyone with a basic understanding of simple equilibrium, either algebraically or geometrically.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
