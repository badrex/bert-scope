It examines magnesium removal during anoxic diagenesis and in the basalt-seawater system, providing thermodynamic predictions for these processes. The study highlights the importance of understanding the magnesium budget in the oceans for steady-state models of ocean geochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
