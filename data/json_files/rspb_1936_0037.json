They found that the vagus nerves contain motor fibers for the stomach, while the splanchnic nerves have motor fibers for the entire duodenum and intestine. The study provides insights into the autonomic nervous system and drug reactions in fish, contributing to the understanding of fish anatomy and physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
