They discovered that a steady current of electricity can be obtained in air from electrodes at a low difference of potential when an independent current is maintained in the same closed vessel. This finding challenges the idea of a finite difference of potential between a gas and a metal in contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
