It presents the symmetry properties of sets of structures, both non-polar and polar, and the matrix elements that come into energy calculations. The author evaluates the energy parameters for work with polar structures using the work of part I and the conclusions of this part.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
