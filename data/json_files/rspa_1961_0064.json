The authors use various methods, including Mellin transforms, Wiener-Hopf technique, and Carleman's method, to solve the equation and provide expansions of the lift derivatives. The findings can be applied to practical applications of jet-flap schemes for lift and thrust production on aerofoils.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
