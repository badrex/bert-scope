This micrometer has several advantages over previous models, including no aberration, no defects from imperfect materials, and the ability to measure the diameter of a planet on both sides of the zero point. The device is suitable for use with reflecting telescopes and could lead to further improvements in telescope design.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics"}
