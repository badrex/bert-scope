They found that X-ray irradiation at low temperatures produces centers and trapped electron centers in undoped and hydrogen-doped crystals. The rate of generation of electron centers in hydrogen-doped crystals is greater than in undoped crystals. The study provides insights into the production of defects in alkaline earth fluorides and the behavior of trapped electron centers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
