The study focuses on nucleophilic addition at alkyne clusters, leading to carbon-carbon bond formation. The author presents various examples of reactions and their outcomes, including the formation of new compounds and the reduction of CO ligands. The research provides insights into the mechanisms and reactivity of these clusters, which can be useful for further development in the field of cluster chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
