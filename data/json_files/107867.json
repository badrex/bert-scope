They discovered that the magnetism destroyed by the removal of a portion has a considerably greater ratio to the whole magnetism developed than the mass removed has to the whole. This finding suggests that there is an accumulation of magnetism arising from the mutual action of the particles upon each other, and continuity has a much greater influence than mass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
