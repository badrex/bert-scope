It discusses exact results and short-wave approximations, and mentions computations that overlap with those in a previous paper by B. Jeffreys. Lady Jeffreys also points out a correction to an equation and a transposition in a line of S2.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mathematical Physics"}
