They describe the properties and reactions of these compounds, such as their flammability, density, and decomposition when exposed to water. The author also mentions the possibility of a pentadic condition of the boron atom, similar to nitrogen, phosphorus, and arsenic.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
