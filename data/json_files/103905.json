The fish had a thick, brown skin with white spots, and a semilunar hole on its head, similar to a porpoise. It was believed to feed on carcasses and had a prominent tooth, which some thought was a horn. The fish's length was measured at 17 feet 9 inches, and its greatest thickness at 14 feet.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ichthyology"}
