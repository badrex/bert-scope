They explain the method of hydrostatic weighing to determine the specific gravity of solids and fluids, which can be used to calculate the weight of a cubic foot of a substance or find its size given its weight. This information can be useful for understanding the properties of materials and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Density and Specific Gravity"}
