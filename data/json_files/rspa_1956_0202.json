The authors analyze the energy levels and wave functions of the additional electrons in the ion and consider the interactions between the electrons and the surrounding molecules. They also study the optical absorption spectrum of plutonyl ions in various compounds and find that the dominant terms in the Hamiltonian are of the type and. The results provide insights into the behavior of plutonyl ions and their potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Uranium chemistry"}
