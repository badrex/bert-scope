This new system considers the variation of one, two, or three bar lengths and examines the transmission properties of the linkages. The author applies this classification to various animal systems, such as skull elevation and jaw protrusion mechanisms in different species, the coral crushing apparatus of parrotfishes, and catapult mechanisms in feeding pipefishes. This approach provides a better understanding of the mechanical properties of linkages and offers insights into possible evolutionary changes in biological linkages.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
