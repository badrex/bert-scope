The research investigates the behavior of various metals, including lead, copper, and iron, and shows that they all follow the same general laws of flow. The findings reveal that the flow becomes more viscous as the temperature increases, and small impurities do not affect the general type of the extension curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
