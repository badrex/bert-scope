Despite facing health challenges, he authored a widely recognized textbook on heat and thermodynamics and conducted groundbreaking research on the accommodation coefficient and adsorption of gases on metal surfaces. His work has had a lasting impact on our understanding of adsorption processes and heterogeneous catalysis."}
