The study finds that the degree of asymmetry in these secondary sex traits is larger than in other traits not subjected to sexual selection, and there is a negative relationship between the degree of asymmetry and the size of the weapon. This demonstrates that horn and spur size may reliably reflect male quality as determined by the degree of fluctuating asymmetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
