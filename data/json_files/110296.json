He demonstrates that the Earth's magnetic field can induce electrical currents in conductive materials, such as copper and iron. Faraday also explores the potential applications of this discovery, including the possibility of harnessing this energy for electrical machines. He further examines the relationship between the motion of magnets and conductors and the production of electric currents, establishing the principles of electromagnetic induction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
