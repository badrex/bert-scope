He explains that these phenomena can be understood through a general principle, which allows for the calculation of the tints of colored rings and the behavior of double refraction. This principle is based on the principles of mechanics and can be applied to even the most complex crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
