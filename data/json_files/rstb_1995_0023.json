The researchers compiled a 163-character morphological database and molecular sequences from large and small subunit ribosomal RNA genes. Their findings provide insights into the relationships of higher taxa within the echinoid group, contributing to a better understanding of their evolutionary history.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinodermata"}
