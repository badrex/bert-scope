The method involves using a capillary tube filled with a solution of a salt and a buffering cation, with two reservoirs containing anions and cations. By applying a constant current, ions in the sample move and separate based on their mobility. The technique offers advantages over zone electrophoresis, such as sharper fronts and the ability to detect ions in low concentrations. The separation can be followed by measuring temperature differences along the capillary tube, providing a qualitative and quantitative analysis of the sample.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
