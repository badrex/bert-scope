The study focuses on plasma properties, density, confinement time, and plasma-wall interaction. The research aims to establish the conditions necessary for studying a reacting plasma, with the ultimate goal of achieving controlled nuclear fusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
