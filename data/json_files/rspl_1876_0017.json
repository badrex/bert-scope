They discovered that the striae, or layers, of the discharge have a proper motion along the tube, and that these striae can be classified as flake-like or flocculent. The author also found that the number and behavior of the striae depend on the resistance of the tube, the duration of the current, and the electromotive force.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
