The authors use X-ray analysis to examine the alloys and find that the magnetic properties of these materials depend on their heat treatment and composition. They also discover that the alloys with a superlattice structure have a higher magnetization intensity than those with a disordered structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
