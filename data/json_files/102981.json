The growths hardened into horns, grew up to 2 inches long, and fell off after several months before regrowing. The author, Dr. Rich. Wroe, shares this medical curiosity with the Royal Society and sends them samples of the horns for further study.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Dermatology"}
