He analyzed various sources of error that could affect the measurements and discussed the importance of temperature control and the use of precise instruments. Kater's method allowed for more accurate measurements of pendulum length, which was essential for timekeeping devices of that time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
