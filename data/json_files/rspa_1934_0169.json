The author conducts experiments using a specialized apparatus and golden syrup, observing the effects of viscosity, surface tension, and flow speed on drop deformation. The results provide insights into the mechanics of emulsion formation and the role of these factors in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
