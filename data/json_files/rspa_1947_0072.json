The authors estimate the cooling by considering radiation equilibrium and the removal of solar energy after sunset. They discuss different methods for calculating the cooling and present the results in a table. The study also examines the factors affecting the cooling, such as air mass movements and the presence of water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
