They used an ionization chamber and a magnetic analyzer to analyze the ions and found evidence of diatomic mercury molecular ions (Hg2+) being formed by the attachment of excited atoms to normal atoms. This discovery reconciles the chemical evidence of mercury vapor being monatomic with the band spectra evidence of its presence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
