They used intracellular recording of endplate potential and current in glycerol-pretreated frog sartorius muscle and concluded that the post-tetanic depolarization is accompanied by membrane fluctuations resembling typical 'acetylcholine noise'. This indicates that the prolonged depolarization arises from the continued action of a residue of acetylcholine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
