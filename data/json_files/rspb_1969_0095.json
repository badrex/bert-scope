They found that the usage of adenosine triphosphate (ATP) per pulse decreased at higher rates of stimulation, and that little ATP was used by muscles in hypertonic solutions. The results suggest that activation heat and the heat of shortening are not associated with ATP splitting.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
