Pultney provides a detailed account of several plants that exhibit this behavior, including the Trifolium pratense album, and notes that this may be related to the process of pollination. He also highlights the importance of further research on this topic to understand the underlying mechanisms and potential applications in botany.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
