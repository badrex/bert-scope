The research reveals significantly enhanced levels of local backscattered power from the crest regions of small-scale breaking waves, consistent with Bragg scattering from organized hydrodynamic surface disturbances generated in the breaking zones. The findings contribute new physical insights into the high wavenumber region of the surface height spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
