They found that the lipids of this micro-organism are metabolically stable and that chromatophores originate from the cytoplasmic membrane. The specific radioactivity of the phospholipid of the chromatophores was the same as that of the adapted cells, indicating that no distinction can be made between different parts of the cytoplasmic membrane system with respect to the labeling of the lipids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
