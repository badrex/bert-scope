The results showed that the oscillation occurring while the moon is below the horizon has the same amount at both stations, but the oscillation occurring while the moon is above the horizon has twice the amount at the lower station and half the amount at the upper station. This finding is difficult to explain by any theory depending solely on the attraction of gravity and agrees with previous conclusions for the solar diurnal oscillation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
