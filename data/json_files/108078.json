These actions are caused by tidal currents and waves, which move shingles along the coast. The author also explains the order in which pebbles are found on the beach, depending on their dimensions, and how this order can be used to distinguish the effects of waves from those of currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Coastal Geology"}
