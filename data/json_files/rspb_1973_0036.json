The research shows that the determination of cyclic AMP content in spermatozoa is a sensitive indicator of sperm activity, useful in detecting the onset of declining motility and other changes associated with sperm senescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
