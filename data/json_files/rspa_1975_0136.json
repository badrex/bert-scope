It shows that the magnetization function is a solution of Legendre's modular equation of degree 3 and can be expressed explicitly in terms of an algebraic hypergeometric function. The study also reveals the behavior of the magnetization near the critical point and non-physical singularities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
