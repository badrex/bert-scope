They found that the transition temperature of the impedance decreases and the magnitude of the change is reduced when the liquid is subjected to pressure. The results support Landau's theory of a Fermi liquid and the existence of zero sound in helium-3.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
