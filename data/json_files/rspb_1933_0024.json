They discovered that these worms have a Galenic circulation in their capillaries and that their blood vessels are rhythmically contractile. The study provides insights into the anatomy and physiology of these worms and their respiratory and circulatory systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
