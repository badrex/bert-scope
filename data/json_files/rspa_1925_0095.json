The author, T.H. Havelock, explores how the resistance at different speeds depends on the draught and how interference effects due to bow and stern waves are affected by changing draught. The study shows that these interference effects become less significant with decreasing draught, but the maxima and minima occur at practically the same positions. The findings provide valuable insights for ship designers and help in understanding the relationship between draught, wave resistance, and ship performance."}
