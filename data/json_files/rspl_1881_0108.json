They found that the electrical resistance of metals can be temporarily altered by longitudinal stress, and that permanent extension can affect the temporary alteration of resistance. The study also revealed that stress applied in a direction transverse to the current can produce alterations in resistance opposite to those resulting from longitudinal traction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
