The organ consists of large, cup-shaped bodies with three distinct layers: the lining, a thick median striated layer, and an outer cortical layer. The organ's structure and function provide insights into the biology and electrophysiology of fish nervous systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
