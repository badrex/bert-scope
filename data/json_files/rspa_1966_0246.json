They found that the intensity of the afterglow is proportional to the concentration of oxygen and sulphur monoxide. The reaction between sulphur monoxide and nitrogen dioxide was also investigated, and it was found to be very exothermic. This research provides a better understanding of the reactions of SO in discharge flow systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
