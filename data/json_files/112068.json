The author discusses the difference between disjunct and pulsative tones, the role of beat frequency in creating discord, and how combining compound tones can create artificial qualities of tone, or musical chords. The article also explores the concept of the \"real root\" or fundamental bass of a chord, which may differ from the supposed root assigned by musicians.", "scientific_discipline": "Music Theory > Acoustics"}
