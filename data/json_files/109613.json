He also found other interesting substances, such as iridium and osmium, and made observations on the ruby-like crystals found in the ore. Wollaston's experiments led him to consider palladium as a new simple metal and he named it after the planet discovered by Dr. Olbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
