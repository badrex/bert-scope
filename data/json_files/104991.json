He used microscopes to study the intricate structures of snowflakes, which he found to be hexagonal in shape. Nettis discovered a wide variety of snowflake shapes, including hexagonal lamellae, oblong hexagonal particles, and slender hexagonal spiculae. His work provides a detailed account of the fascinating world of snowflake formations and their unique structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
