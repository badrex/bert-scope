The research focuses on symmetric bending and the relevant loads, revealing that despite similar dimensions and operating conditions, these ships display different stress distribution patterns along their hulls. The findings suggest that designing for the strength of the midship section may not be sufficient for all ships, and further investigation into the effects of environmental conditions on stress distribution is needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
