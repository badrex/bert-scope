The researchers found that 16.9% of the insect species surveyed were infected with Wolbachia, with double infections occurring at higher frequencies than expected. The results suggest that Wolbachia may play a significant role in rapid speciation in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
