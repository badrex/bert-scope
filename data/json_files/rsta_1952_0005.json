The authors develop a mathematical model for the problem, considering incompressible potential flow and neglecting viscosity, ground friction, and turbulence. They present numerical solutions for the early stages of the motion and discuss the implications for the collapse of fluid columns, such as the base surge observed during atomic weapon trials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
