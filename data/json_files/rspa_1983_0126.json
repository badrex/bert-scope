They find that a vortex with an aerofoil-shaped boundary is a possible region of solution and determine the corresponding angular velocity, strain rates, and stability conditions. The study uses complex notation and conformal mapping theory to analyze the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics > Fluid Dynamics"}
