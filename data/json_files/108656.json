Based on the unique characteristics of the skull, such as the absence of median vomerine teeth and the presence of double zygomatic outer arches, the author concludes that the Placodus belongs to the class Reptilia, specifically with affinities to the Lacertian order and the extinct genus Sinosaurus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
