The authors found that hydrogen indirectly affects the rates of other reactions taking place, and they developed a method to analyze the complex gas mixtures produced during the experiments. The results showed that the rate of formation of condensate and the rate of disappearance of ethane were influenced by the presence of hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
