They found that the heart is more dependent on its oxygen supply than skeletal muscles, which can function independently for short intervals. The stimulation maximum of lactic acid in the heart is lower than in skeletal muscles, indicating that the heart cannot accumulate much lactic acid before it starts to function improperly.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
