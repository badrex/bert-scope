Crace-Calvert's research investigates the role of oxygen in the development of putrefactive vibrios and the process of putrefaction. The experiments show that oxygen is essential for the growth and life of vibrio-life, while other gases like nitrogen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid have a lesser impact. The study also explores the transformation of monads into vibrios and their eventual change into microzyma, providing insights into the complex world of microbial life and putrefaction processes."}
