Norman Lockyer, reports on the observations and discussion of the total solar eclipse that occurred on April 16th, 1893. The study focused on the solar physics aspects, including the corona and prominences. The author used various instruments and techniques, such as prismatic cameras and spectroscopes, to analyze the eclipse and its phenomena. The study provided insights into the nature of the corona and the continuous spectrum, as well as the brightness and distribution of the arcs and lines observed during the eclipse.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
