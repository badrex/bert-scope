They found the equivalent weight of chlorine to be 35.195, which is slightly higher than previous calculations. This method allowed for a more accurate comparison between chlorine and hydrogen, potentially reducing systematic errors in atomic weight determinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
