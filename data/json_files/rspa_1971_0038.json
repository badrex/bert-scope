They develop a mathematical model to predict the compression of the cylinder and demonstrate its application in determining the material properties of soft elastic materials like gelatin. The study also shows that gelatin behaves more like a Mooney material than a material with a quadratic form for the strain energy function.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
