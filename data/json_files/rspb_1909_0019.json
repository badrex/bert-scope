The author demonstrates that the correlation coefficients remain constant across generations and are influenced by the dominance principle. The findings suggest that the relationship between gametic and somatic constitutions may be more complex than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
