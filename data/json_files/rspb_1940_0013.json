F. Mohamed and J. Proudman aimed to study the hydrography and chemistry of the area. They collected data on temperature, salinity, and dissolved oxygen at various depths and locations, revealing complex currents and the presence of a minimum oxygen stratum in the Red Sea. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the oceanography of the Red Sea and its surrounding regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
