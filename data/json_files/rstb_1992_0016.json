The authors present data from plant fossils, including evidence of eaten leaves, borings, wound reactions, and leaf mines, as well as arthropod gut contents and coprolites. They discuss the evolution of plant-arthropod interactions and the importance of the fossil record in understanding these relationships.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
