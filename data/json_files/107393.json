These sheep were initially bred in America and were expected to be valuable due to their inability to jump fences. However, they have some disadvantages, such as difficulty in driving them to market and smaller, less saleable carcasses. The author also mentions the decline of the Ancon breed due to the introduction of Merinos, which are better feeders and have higher-quality fleeces.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Genetics and Breeding"}
