The authors analyze the relative absorption cross-sections and discuss the observed photoabsorption structure, including the spin-orbit splitting of the core and the auto-ionized Rydberg series. The study provides insights into the electronic structure and properties of lanthanide elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
