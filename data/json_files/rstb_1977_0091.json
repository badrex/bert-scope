Doppler experiment and its findings. They explore topics such as gravity waves, traveling ionospheric disturbances, F-region winds, and the correlation between geomagnetic pulsations and rapid oscillations observed in the ionosphere. The discussion also touches upon the influence of varying earth currents and the importance of the angle between the Earth's magnetic axis and the direction of the Sun on magnetic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
