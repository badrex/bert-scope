They introduce a variational principle to overcome the rank deficiency in the derived element stiffness matrix and provide general formulae for deformation, membrane action, and rigid body movement. The study concludes with the development of a triangular finite element that recovers arbitrary rigid body movements, inextensional deformations, and membrane actions, anticipating its widespread application.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Analysis"}
