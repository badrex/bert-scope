They describe the rod-like and spherical forms of these organisms and their presence in different environments. The author also addresses the criticism of these long forms being made up of smaller spherical or coccoid bodies, providing evidence against this view. The existence of large forms in both organisms is highlighted, and their presence in older lesions and lymph is mentioned.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
