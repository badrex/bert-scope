The experiments reveal that the concentration of carbon dioxide in the mixed phase can be significantly higher than expected from Dalton's law, especially at high pressures and low temperatures. The results show that the behavior of this system is consistent with a binary system near the critical point of the more volatile component when the second component separates as the solid phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Solubility and Phase Equilibrium"}
