He used a mixture of diluted vitriolic acid and strong fuming nitrous acid, and added snow to lower the temperature. Walker discovered that he could successfully freeze mercury and observed its properties, paving the way for further research in cryogenics and temperature measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Cryogenics"}
