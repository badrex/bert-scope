They find that the model captures the overall evolution of oceanic and atmospheric variables for a canonical warm event when certain conditions are met. The model behavior is sensitive to ocean mixed-layer physics associated with external winds, and the authors discuss the possible causes and termination of the warm event based on model results and observations of the Asian monsoon.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
