The results show that non-equilibrium states, such as using cells from 24-hour glucose-exhausted cultures, can lead to distorted cell properties. Continuous culture methods provide more accurate equilibrium values for cell properties. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the economy of the cell and the factors affecting its growth and division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
