The process involves converting coal to methanol, which is then converted to high-quality gasoline using a zeolite catalyst. The MTG process offers a more cost-effective and environmentally friendly alternative to existing coal liquefaction methods, such as the Fischer-Tropsch process. The article also highlights the chemistry behind the MTG process and the potential for future development and expansion of this technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy and Fuels"}
