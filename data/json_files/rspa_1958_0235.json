They found that the magnetic moments per atom of the alloys vary linearly with composition, and the reduced magnetization-temperature curves show a continuous decrease in fullness with increasing copper content. This study provides a more accurate understanding of the magnetic properties of nickel-copper alloys compared to previous research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
