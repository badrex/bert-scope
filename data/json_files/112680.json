The observations include measurements of deflection, vibration, and dip, which are used to calculate the horizontal, vertical, and total forces. The author, J. A. De Souza, discusses the instruments, methods, and corrections used in the measurements, and provides the values of the magnetic moment and the earth's horizontal magnetic intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
