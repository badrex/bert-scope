It discusses high-mass and low-mass binary systems, their properties, and differences in X-ray behavior. The article also highlights recent observations of three galactic X-ray sources, H1705-25, and SS Cygni, and their implications for understanding the nature of these sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
