Rho regulates the assembly of focal adhesions and actin stress fibers, while Rac is involved in actin polymerization at the plasma membrane and activation of a membrane-bound NADPH oxidase in phagocytes. These proteins play a crucial role in various cellular processes, including phagocytosis and cell signaling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
