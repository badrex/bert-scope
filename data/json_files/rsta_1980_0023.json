The author emphasizes the importance of oceanographic, tectonic, and climatic controls in determining facies successions on continental slopes and rises. The study provides new evidence on the role of gravity-controlled mechanisms, such as turbidity currents and debris flows, in sediment transport on these margins.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
