Blackett, investigates the energy-range relation for cosmic-ray particles by comparing the energy spectrum of the rays before and after passing through an absorber. The study allows for the determination of the relation between the range and energy of the particles, providing insights into the energy loss and absorption of cosmic rays. The findings suggest that particles with energies between 5.5 and 1500 MeV suffer an energy loss due to radiation and shower formation, which is larger than the ionization loss itself.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
