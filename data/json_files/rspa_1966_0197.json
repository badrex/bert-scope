The author demonstrates how these quantities arise from solving the Einstein field equations and how they are related to the multipole moments of the source distribution. The study focuses on the axisymmetric case and the general static situation, providing insights into the behavior of isolated sources in empty space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
