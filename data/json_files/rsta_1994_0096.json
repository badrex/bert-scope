The authors propose a new approach to predicting and analyzing chaotic stochastic systems, using modern statistical developments to construct pointwise predictors and predictive intervals/distributions. They also discuss the challenges of predicting chaotic systems and the importance of understanding the sensitivity of conditional distributions to initial conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
