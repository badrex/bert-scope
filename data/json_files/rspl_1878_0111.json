They compare the skull structure of lizards to that of snakes, tortoises, crocodiles, and birds, highlighting similarities and differences. The study provides insights into the evolutionary relationships between these species and contributes to the understanding of vertebrate morphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate morphology"}
