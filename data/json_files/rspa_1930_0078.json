The authors find that in a three-dimensional disturbance, the pattern is eventually destroyed, with vortices either coming together or losing their identity due to the spread of vorticity. The study provides insights into the behavior of vortices in fluid dynamics and their applications in engineering and environmental sciences.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
