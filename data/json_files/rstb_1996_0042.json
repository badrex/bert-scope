It highlights the importance of neurotrophic support in diabetic neuropathy and suggests that correcting these deficits should be a primary therapeutic target. The study also demonstrates that intensive insulin treatment and exogenous NGF administration can help normalize these deficits in rodent models of diabetes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
