The reaction is found to be first-order in both reactants, with an activation energy of 68.3 kcal/mol. The strong CN emission accompanying the reaction is mainly due to the reaction between oxygen atoms and cyanogen. The results provide insights into the overall chemical reaction and help understand the behavior of CN radicals in different reaction systems."}
