They calculate the probability of penetration and explain the role of Coulomb repulsion and proton-neutron interaction in the deuteron. This research helps to understand nuclear reactions and improve the understanding of nuclear forces and binding energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
