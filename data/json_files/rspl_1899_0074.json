The author investigates the growth and morphology of nodules in various legume genera, as well as the bacteria within them. They also study the effects of different environmental conditions on the nodules and the plants' ability to fix nitrogen. The author concludes that the presence or absence of nitragin is just one factor in a complex problem, and other factors like soil and atmospheric conditions, as well as the symbiotic action of the host plants, must be considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
