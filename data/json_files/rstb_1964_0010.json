The research reconstructs the formation of steep-sided valleys, or coombes, and their associated chalk debris deposits. The findings provide insights into the Late-glacial and Post-glacial periods, including the effects of climate change and human activities on the landscape.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
