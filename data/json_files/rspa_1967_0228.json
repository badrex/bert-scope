They found that impure crystals follow the relaxation time approximation, while purified crystals do not. The results suggest that longitudinal magnetoresistance can be used to detect the presence of diffusive scattering and provide insights into the form of electron scattering in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
