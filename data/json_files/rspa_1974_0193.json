They found that the active catalyst is a ruthenium subcarbonyl containing five carbonyl ligands per ruthenium triad. The results showed that but-l-ene isomerization occurs in the absence of molecular hydrogen, and the mechanism involves a hydrogen abstraction-addition process and the formation of an allyl intermediate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
