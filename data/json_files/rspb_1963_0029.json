The DNA mass remains relatively constant during most of the growth cycle, while the cell size and RNA mass show significant changes. The findings support the greater constancy of DNA mass and provide insights into the bacterial growth process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
