The authors analyze the requirements for commercial production offshore, considering factors such as cost, reservoir quality, and the likelihood of finding suitable geological conditions in deep water. They conclude that deep water areas do not have the potential to produce as much oil and gas as land and shallow-water areas, and that although deep water will contribute to hydrocarbon production, it will not significantly impact the imminent shortages of oil."}
