The research also investigates the mode of termination of afferent fibers from the motor cortex, globus pallidus, and deep cerebellar nuclei. The findings reveal similarities and differences in the ultrastructure of the two nuclei and provide insights into their synaptic organization and connectivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroanatomy"}
