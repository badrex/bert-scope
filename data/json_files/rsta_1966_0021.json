The authors develop a theoretical model and apply it to Windermere, comparing their results with observed fluctuations in the thermocline. The research provides insights into the interaction between wind and water in stratified lakes, contributing to the understanding of lake dynamics and water movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology and Limnology"}
