It highlights the contributions of W.L. Bragg and the author's own experiences in applying the Fourier method to copper sulphate pentahydrate. The method allowed for more accurate and detailed analysis of crystal structures, revolutionizing the field of crystallography.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
