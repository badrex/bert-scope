They discovered a novel phenomenon where there is little or no variation in the force component parallel to the Earth's axis during the afternoon hours. This phenomenon was observed in XZ diagrams, which represent the diurnal force changes projected on the vertical plane containing the astronomical meridian.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
