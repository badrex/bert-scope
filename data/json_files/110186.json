He tested the shocks given by living torpedoes through various circuits and found that they did not decompose water or produce magnetic effects. Davy concluded that the Torpedo's electrical organs function similarly to a weakly charged Voltaic pile with an impermeable fluid conductor.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Marine Biology"}
