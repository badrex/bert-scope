They discovered that fleas can transmit the parasite through a cyclical method, where the flea acts as a host for the parasite's development and multiplication. This method is different from the direct method, where the flea only serves as a physical means of transmission. The study provides insights into the biology and transmission of the parasite, which can help in understanding and controlling diseases caused by trypanosomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
