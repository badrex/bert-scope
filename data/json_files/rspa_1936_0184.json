They observed the behavior of magnetic fields in both types of supraconducting bodies and confirmed the law of constant flux. The results showed that persistent currents can flow in multiply connected bodies, while simply connected bodies have zero constant flux.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
