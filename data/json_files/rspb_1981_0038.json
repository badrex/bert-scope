These syndromes have implications for human health, including increased sensitivity to DNA-damaging agents, neurological diseases, and impaired immune responses. The author also explores the connection between DNA repair deficiencies and the development of skin cancer, as well as the potential role of DNA repair in immune system function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
