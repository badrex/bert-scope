It focuses on the structural and acoustic edge-noise when the control surface is modeled by a semi-infinite, thin elastic plate that can support bending waves. The author provides numerical results for steel plates in air and water, showing that when the frequency is smaller than the coincidence frequency, bending wave power exceeds the total sound power generated at the edge, making secondary scattering a dominant source of acoustic radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics and Acoustics"}
