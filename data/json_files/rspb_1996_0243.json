Two experimental habitats were arranged: a homogeneous one with free-floating cells and a structured one with cells forming layers on a solid medium. The results showed that bacteria adapted not only to the habitat structure but also to nutritional conditions. Evolution in a non-homogeneous environment produced a greater variety of adaptations, suggesting that specialization may result in fitness trade-offs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
