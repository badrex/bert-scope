It explores theoretical calculations for predicting turbulence near the upwind face of a building and velocity in the building's wake. The article also surveys various experiments on flow around models in wind tunnels and natural wind simulations, highlighting the importance of understanding wind effects on building design and its impact on the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Wind Engineering"}
