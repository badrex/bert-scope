The authors analyze the synaptic inputs to motoneurons and examine how different types of responses, including resistance reflexes and elicited responses, are controlled by central commands and interneuron combinations. The study reveals the importance of sensory integration and interneuron interactions in coordinating leg movements and generating coordinated responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
