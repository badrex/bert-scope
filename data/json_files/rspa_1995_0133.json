They find that their developed model provides better predictions than Han & Yin's (1993) model, which contains an error. The study includes comparisons with experimental and numerical results for two cases of shock-wave interaction, demonstrating the improved accuracy of the new model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
