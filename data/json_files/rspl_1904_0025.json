They find that the electrical conductivity of these solutions cannot measure their acidity or ionization, as other ions besides hydrion can have significant concentrations and velocities. The author also shows that amphoteric electrolytes do not follow Ostwald's dilution law, and their ionized proportion remains constant regardless of dilution. This study highlights the limitations of using electrical conductivity measurements to determine the dissociation constants of amphoteric electrolytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
