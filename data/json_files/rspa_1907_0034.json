The author finds that the ionization is directly proportional to the pressure and that the energy spent per ion is independent of chemical combination. The study also shows that the chemical bond affects the ionization per cubic centimeter in certain gases, such as hydrogen, and the energy spent per ion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
