They find that the pressure increases rapidly at first and then oscillates with diminishing amplitude, eventually reaching a constant value. The motion of the fluid around the sphere is similar to that of a spherical source generated on the axis of a rotating liquid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
