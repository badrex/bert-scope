He found that the compound consists of a mixture of azote and chlorine. The author also analyzed the compound's reaction with various solutions, such as muriatic acid, nitric acid, and sulfuric acid, and its effect on mercury. This research helped determine the composition of the detonating substance and its potential applications."}
