These teeth are rootless, ever-growing scalpriform incisors, which are different from other known species. The author compares the teeth's microscopic structure to that of other marsupials and rodents, finding a closer resemblance to the wombat. The discovery of Sceparnodon contributes to the understanding of the extinct marsupial fauna of Australia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
