The authors explore two models of the saturated layer at the interface and their effects on the oxidation process. They also consider the role of surface reactions and the influence of the gas/oxide interface on the oxidation rate, providing insights into the behavior of various metal systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
