The authors extend the iterative Fourier-series solution of Dean's simplified Navier-Stokes equations to calculate the dispersion and compare their results with experimental measurements and theoretical work. The study shows that secondary flow can produce a more uniform distribution of velocity over the fluid than in Poiseuille flow, and it highlights the importance of convection in the dispersion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
