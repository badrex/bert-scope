The authors describe the band systems, analyze the energy levels, and discuss the intensity of the bands. They compare their findings with wave mechanics and provide a detailed analysis of the Zeeman effect, excitation potentials, and the influence of helium admixture on the bands. The study contributes to the understanding of molecular spectroscopy and atomic and molecular physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
