The authors take into account various objections and modifications to the Bloch theory, providing a more complete and consistent quantitative account of the transport properties of these metals. While the theory does not give exact numerical agreement with observations, it offers a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the conductivities of monovalent metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
