The experiments reveal a new type of derangement where a nucleus at early diplotene changes directly into a pollen-grain resting nucleus. The findings show that heat treatment affects chromosome behavior, leading to the formation of diplochromosomes and various types of abnormal pollen grains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
