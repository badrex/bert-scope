They discovered that the undischarged nematocyst thread has a screw-like shape due to helical pleats in the membrane, which transforms into a smooth cylinder during discharge. The thread's structure and dimensional changes during discharge were analyzed, providing insights into the function and mechanics of nematocyst discharge in this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
