Kenner's research focused on aromatic nitrocompounds, spiro-compounds, and the formation of compounds containing a seven-membered ring. His work on diphenyl derivatives and nitroso-compounds led to important discoveries in stereochemistry and the understanding of the structure of diphenyl and its derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
