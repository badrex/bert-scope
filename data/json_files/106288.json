He suggests that drowning falls under the category of a temporary suspension of life's actions, and that restoring breathing can help revive the heart's motion. Hunter also discusses the relationship between the stomach and the rest of the body, as well as the different types of violent deaths.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Resuscitation"}
