They measured the dissipation of space charge following the growth of impulse corona discharges and determined the spatial distribution and magnitude of the space charge, along with the associated electric field. The results provide insights into the behavior of corona space charge and its impact on the development of high voltage sparks in asymmetric electrode configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
