{"article_id": "104067", "revised_title": "The Influence of Water and Soil on Tulip, Narcissus, and Hyacinth Flowering", "semantic_tags": ["Botany", "Plant growth", "Horticulture", "Flowering", "Soil composition"], "tldr": "The author conducted experiments to understand the factors affecting the flowering of tulips, narcissus, and hyacinths. They found that the presence of soil in the water slowed down the flowering process and that the tulips and narcissus needed to be placed on the glasses earlier than hyacinths for optimal results. The author also noted that using fresh roots every year would yield better results. This method allows people without gardens to grow these flowers in their chambers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
