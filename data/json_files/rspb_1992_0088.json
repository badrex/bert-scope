They found that only 56% of synapses made by glycine-utilizing amacrine cells showed glycine receptor immunoreactivity. This indicates that only a portion of the postsynaptic sites contacted by these neurons can respond to glycine, suggesting that a neuron containing multiple neuroactive substances can selectively affect postsynaptic elements by means of heterogeneous receptor localization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
