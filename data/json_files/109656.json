He transposed portions of bark between different tree species and observed that new layers of cortex and alburnum were generated, but no part of the bark was converted into alburnum. Knight also noted the differences in bark qualities and the lack of transmutation in the progressive formation of alburnum in young oak shoots.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Biology"}
