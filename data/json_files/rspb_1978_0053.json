The research shows that spermatozoa from poor-quality semen undergo peroxidation faster than those from normal ejaculates, and that seminal plasma contains a factor that counteracts the toxic effects of both endogenous and exogenous lipid peroxidation. The findings suggest that lipid peroxidation could be used as a basis for a biochemical method of semen quality appraisal.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
