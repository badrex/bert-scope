He discovered that albumen coagulates at the negative pole due to the separation of alkali, and that electrolysis can detect larger quantities of albumen than heat alone. This research led him to question whether mucus might be a compound of albumen with soda.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
