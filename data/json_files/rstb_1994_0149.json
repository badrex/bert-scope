The research demonstrates a trade-off between reproductive effort and the ability to resist parasitic infections. It shows that pre-breeding nutritional status correlates positively with reproductive success and negatively with susceptibility to parasitism. The findings suggest that the interaction between parasitic infection, nutrition, and reproductive effort can be an essential mechanism in shaping life-history variation in avian populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
