Primary reflexions are diffuse and temperature-sensitive, while secondary reflexions are structure-sensitive and only present in type I diamonds. The intensity of the primary reflexions varies from one diamond to another, while the secondary reflexions are more consistent. The authors also discussed the temperature sensitivity of the reflexions and the use of diamonds as monochromators.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
