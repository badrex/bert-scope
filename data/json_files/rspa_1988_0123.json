The method involves propelling a droplet in a near-vertical trajectory and releasing the combustion chamber and instrumentation into free fall when the droplet reaches the apex. Results are described for toluene and heptane droplets, and the technique allows for the observation of the entire burning history from ignition to burnout or extinction. This method provides valuable insights into droplet combustion mechanisms and helps improve our understanding of fuel burning under realistic conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric and Space Science"}
