The authors used two main methods, the electrically heated wire and the cooling thermometer, to determine the conductivity. They discuss the importance of maintaining constant temperatures and overcoming challenges in their experimental setup. The results provide insights into the thermal properties of carbon dioxide and its applications in heat transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
