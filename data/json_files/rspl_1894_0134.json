They analyze the carbon dioxide expired and oxygen absorbed in each form using experiments and bell-jars. The results show that each form of breathing has a different impact on the respiratory ratio and the body's carbon dioxide and oxygen levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
