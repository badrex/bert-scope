The authors analyze the flow using linearized equations of motion and obtain asymptotic solutions for small and large Reynolds numbers. They also consider non-periodic distortions of the walls at arbitrary Reynolds numbers and provide examples of shear and pressure gradient distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
