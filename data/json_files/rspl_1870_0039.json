The results show that the average pressure at any point of a fluid is equal to a constant diminished by the product of the density into half the square of the velocity. This theorem helps to clarify ideas in the field of hydrodynamics and offers new experimental illustrations for the study of vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
