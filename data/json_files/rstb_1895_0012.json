They demonstrate this through experiments where leaves transpire against pressures higher than the atmosphere, showing that the leaf is capable of generating the necessary tensile stress to raise columns of water. This theory explains the curious structure of the conducting tissues of trees and is in agreement with previous research on the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
