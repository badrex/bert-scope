The authors explain that platelet adhesion and aggregation can be influenced by surface features such as hydrophobicity, hydrophilicity, and hydrogen bonding capacity. They also explore the use of drugs that alter platelet function, such as cyclo-oxygenase inhibitors and drugs that increase cyclic AMP levels, to suppress platelet-biomaterial interactions and reduce thromboembolic complications in patients with artificial heart valves, arterial grafts, and other prosthetic devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
