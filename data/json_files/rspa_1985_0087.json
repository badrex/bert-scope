The study assumes the fluid is irrotational, isentropic, and acts as a test fluid without self-gravitation. The Lagrangian of the system is found to be the pressure, and the article explores the dynamics of fluctuations and the conservation of the Noether current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativistic Fluid Dynamics"}
