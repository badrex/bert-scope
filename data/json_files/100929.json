Cassegrain", "semantic_tags": ["Telescope design", "Optics", "Catadioptrical Telescope", "Refraction", "Isaac Newton"], "tldr": "In this article, Isaac Newton and M. Cassegrain discuss the design of the catadioptrical telescope. Newton explains the disadvantages of Cassegrain's design, such as the loss of light due to reflection and the difficulty of forming a precise shape for the convex mirror. He also highlights the limitations of other telescopes with similar designs. The article concludes that the catadioptrical telescope may not be practical due to its shortcomings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
