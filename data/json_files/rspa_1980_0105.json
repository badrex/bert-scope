The authors use a modified Garrett-Munk spectrum with a continuous range of vertical wavenumbers to describe the irregularities caused by internal waves and derive the transverse autocorrelation function. The theory is compared with experimental observations, showing satisfactory agreement in general features.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
