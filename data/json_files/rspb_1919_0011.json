Tetani in Wounds and Prophylactic Inoculation", "semantic_tags": ["Bacteriology", "Tetanus", "Serology", "Prophylactic Inoculation", "Wound Infections"], "tldr": "The author investigated the distribution of serological types of B. tetani in wounds of men who received prophylactic inoculation. They found that the administration of anti-toxin corresponding to one type may not confer immunity against all types of B. tetani. The study also showed that the prevalence of different types of B. tetani in wounds of men with and without tetanus can provide insights into the pathogenesis of the disease and the effectiveness of prophylactic measures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
