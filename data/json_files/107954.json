The author's findings contradict previous theories by the Hunter brothers and other anatomists, suggesting that the placenta consists solely of umbilical vessels covered by membranes and adheres to the uterus through fibrous connections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
