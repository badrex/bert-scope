They found that the tsetse-fly can transmit trypanosomes through its proboscis and that the infection is caused by contamination of the proboscis. The authors also discovered two distinct types of trypanosomes in the digestive tracts of the tsetse-flies, which they named Trypanosoma grayi and Trypanosoma tullochii.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
