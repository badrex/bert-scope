They used the pulsed field method to measure the effect and found a remarkable similarity between the Fermi surfaces of AgZn and PdIn. The results also showed good agreement with band structure calculations on CuZn and AgZn. The Fermi surface consists of a hole sheet in the first band and a multiply connected electron sheet in the second band.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
