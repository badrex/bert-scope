The authors analyze observations of stars Na 1, Ca 11, Mg 1, and 5 Ori using four models of the interstellar medium. They calculate the ionization equilibrium and chemical abundances of sodium, calcium, and magnesium, considering the effects of the diffuse ultraviolet radiation field and background stars. The results show the importance of understanding the ionization balance and chemical abundances in the interstellar medium for astronomical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
