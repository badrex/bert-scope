He explains how lightning can reverse the polarity of compass needles and suggests that better conductivity could prevent damage from lightning strikes. Franklin also shares his methods for firing gunpowder using electricity and describes his experiments with electric charges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
