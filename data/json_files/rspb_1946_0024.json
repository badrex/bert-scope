They found that the membrane resistance and capacity, axoplasm resistance, and external fluid resistance play a significant role in the nerve fiber's response to weak currents. The results provide insights into the structure and function of nerve fibers and may be useful for understanding various biological processes, such as growth, secretion, and respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
