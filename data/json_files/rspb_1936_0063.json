The authors propose that viruses are obligatory parasites that multiply either in or on living cells. They use photodynamic inactivation to study the behavior of viruses in infected animals and determine the time of their entry into susceptible cells. The results show that the protection afforded by living cells to different viruses varies in degree and that viruses need a certain amount of time to penetrate the host cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
