T. Desaguliers describe their experiments on light and colors, focusing on separating and refracting the spectrum. They explain how to successfully separate the colors of light using a prism and a darkened room, and discuss the differences in refraction between different colors. They also demonstrate how the colors in the spectrum can be further separated and manipulated using prisms of different materials and shapes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
