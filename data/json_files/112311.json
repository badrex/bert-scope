Akin, explores the electromotive force of thermo-electric couples and how it depends on the nature of the metals and the temperatures of the junctions. Akin also discusses the influence of the texture and chemical nature of substances on thermo-electric functions and the possibility of thermo-electric inversions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
