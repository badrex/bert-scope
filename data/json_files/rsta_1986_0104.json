The authors recast the basic conservation equations in an Eulerian form and identify various quantities in the conservation equations through weighted averages. Applications to various water wave problems under gravity are discussed, including steady-state solutions for surface disturbances and a detailed study of nonlinear stern waves over infinite depths.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
