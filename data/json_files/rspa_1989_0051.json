The antiphon can produce two memory mechanisms: the repeated cycling of a message through encoding, noisy transmission, and decoding, and the Hopfield net. The antiphon is more physically explicit and easier to analyze than the Hopfield net, and it allows optimization of graph statistics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Optimization"}
