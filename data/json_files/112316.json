W. Hofmann, discovered a new compound called hydrazobenzol, which is isomeric with benzidine. Hydrazobenzol has different properties from benzidine, such as solubility and reaction behavior. The author explains the process of creating hydrazobenzol from azobenzol and its conversion back to azobenzol under various conditions. This discovery expands the understanding of isomerism and chemical reactions in organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
