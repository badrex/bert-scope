They analyzed the vibrational structure of the phenyl spectrum and found two fundamental frequencies at 671 and 890, corresponding to the and frequencies of the state of benzene. The main products of the reaction were diphenyl and other substituted diphenyls, indicating that phenyl radicals disappear mainly by dimerization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
