They identified four distinct postsynaptic components and found that the postsynaptic sites of optic nerve fibers are located in four layers of the superficial part of the optic tectum. The study also describes some electrophysiological properties of each of the four classes of synapses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
