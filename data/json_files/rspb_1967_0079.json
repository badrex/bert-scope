The periodicity is maintained by a combination of passive and active phases, with microfilariae evenly distributed in the blood during the night and accumulating in the lungs during the day. The cycle is oriented to the host's 24-hour rhythm, and different species of microfilariae respond differently to various stimuli to maintain their rhythms. The article also discusses the role of oxygen tension and body temperature in controlling the periodicity and the evolutionary fitness of this behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
