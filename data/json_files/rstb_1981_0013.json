The author presents various methods to determine extinct hominids' diets, focusing on the analysis of tooth microwear. By examining the microwear patterns on fossil hominid teeth, certain diets that have been proposed for them can be ruled out. This research helps to refine dietary hypotheses and better understand the dietary adaptations of our ancestors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
