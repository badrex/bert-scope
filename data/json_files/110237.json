He discovered that there was considerable electrical action in the mine of Huel Jewel in Cornwall and that the intensity of the electric currents differed in different places. This discovery could be useful for miners in determining the relative quantity of ore in veins and their directions. The author also observed that the intensities of heat, electricity, and magnetism increase with depth and that these phenomena are intimately connected.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
