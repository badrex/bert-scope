The importance of carbon substrates like C4 dicarboxylates in supporting nitrogenase activity is highlighted, as well as the role of the host legume in regulating nitrogen fixation. The article also touches upon the assimilation of fixed nitrogen, the glutamine synthetase-glutamate synthase cycle, and the regulation of nodule metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
