Dynamic recrystallization occurs during deformation, while static recrystallization happens when deformation is discontinued but the elevated temperature is maintained. Both processes play a significant role in refining grain size and improving the material's properties. The article also highlights the conditions under which these recrystallization processes are likely to occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
