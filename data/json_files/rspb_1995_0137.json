They applied the test to the 'zebra' element in the fushi tarazu gene of the Drosophila melanogaster species group and found significant evidence for adaptive substitutions. This test can be applied generally to investigate adaptive evolution in the control of gene expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
