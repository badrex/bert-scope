He discovered that these eels give birth to live young, contradicting the common belief that all animalcules are produced from minute eggs floating in the air. Sherwood's findings challenge the understanding of reproduction in these tiny creatures and raise questions about their origins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
