The study reveals that all bands have a similar structure, consisting of three series. However, the third series does not align with the quantum theory's predictions. The findings provide insights into the nature of band heads and the behavior of helium's spectrum, contributing to the understanding of atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
