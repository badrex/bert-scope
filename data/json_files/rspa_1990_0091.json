The algorithm first solves the shallow-water equations to obtain surface elevation and depth-averaged velocity components, then uses these as input to compute the velocity profiles from the momentum equations. The algorithm is tested on several model problems and found to be accurate and efficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
