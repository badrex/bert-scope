They discovered that the presence of a heat-stable fever-producing substance (F.P.B.) in the water, rather than bacterial infection, is the main cause of fever. This substance is responsible for both \"water fever\" and \"salt fever\" and can be found in water even when it contains a low number of organisms. The authors also found that the fever caused by injecting glucose and saccharose was not significant when the solutions were made with pure water.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Infectious Diseases"}
