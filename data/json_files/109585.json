They observe the formation of globules and radiated spheroids during the cooling process, which provide insights into the arrangement of particles in the basalt. The author also discusses the similarities between igneous and aqueous formations and their impact on the debate over the origin of basalt.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
