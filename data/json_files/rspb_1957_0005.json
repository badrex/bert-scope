They used Bateman's equation and calculated the values of the reaction constants for various times. The results showed that with a certain range of values, the differences in reaction rates were insignificant. This study provided insights into the reaction kinetics of carbon monoxide with haemoglobin in sheep.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
