The authors use various comparative methods to analyze reproductive traits and discuss the potential benefits of well-resolved phylogenies for understanding plant reproductive adaptations. They emphasize the importance of considering both ecological and evolutionary factors in studying plant reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
