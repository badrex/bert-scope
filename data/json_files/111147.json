They propose representing the translation of a directed magnitude by a product and apply this concept to the proof of the Parallelogram of Forces and the determination of the effect of forces on a rigid body. This approach allows for a more efficient and concise representation of statics principles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
