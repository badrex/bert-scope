They found that the enzyme catalyzes the formation of oxaloacetate from phosphopyruvate and potassium bicarbonate. Acetyl-coenzyme A significantly stimulates the enzyme activity, suggesting an allosteric regulation mechanism. This study provides insights into the physiological regulation of PEP carboxylase in E. coli and its role in maintaining the tricarboxylic acid cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Metabolism"}
