He worked at Imperial College, where he presided over the postwar expansion of the mathematics department. Jones studied the behavior of electrons in metals using quantum mechanics and made important discoveries about the properties of metals and alloys. His work had a significant impact on the field of solid-state physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
