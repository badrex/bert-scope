They found that after the transformation, pseudo-single crystals were generally obtained, with the 6-axis showing a marked persistence compared to the original 6-axis. The a- and c-axes often underwent rotation about the original direction of the 6-axis. The study provides insights into the geometric and thermodynamic aspects of the transformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
