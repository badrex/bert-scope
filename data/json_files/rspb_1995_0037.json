The authors develop a mechanistic model that demonstrates how signal relay, chemotactic movement, and adaptation orchestrate the collective modes of cell signaling and migration in the aggregating cell layer. The model predicts the observed sequence of aggregation and explains the effects of certain experimental manipulations on pattern formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
