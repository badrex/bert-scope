They discovered that the coefficient of magnetization for ferric and ferrous salts in solution depends only on the quantity of iron per cubic centimeter present. The results showed that ferric salts have a higher coefficient of magnetization than ferrous salts. The effect of temperature on magnetization was also investigated, and the findings were represented by curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
