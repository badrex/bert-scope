They use the concept of atomic polarization and polarizability to determine the energy of interaction between atoms at a large distance apart. The study provides a relation between the van der Waals constant and the polarizabilities of the two atoms, which can be used to estimate the van der Waals energy in various atomic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
