The author explains the three types of antigenic specificities: isotypic, allotypic, and idiotypic. The article explores these specificities in rabbits, mice, and humans, and how they are controlled by genes and their alleles. The author also discusses the distribution of allotypic specificities in different immunoglobulin classes and subunits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
