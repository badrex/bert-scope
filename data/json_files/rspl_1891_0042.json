The authors conducted experiments using tuning forks and a disk siren, finding that single vibrations can be heard even when they do not produce a distinct tone. They also discovered that a series of vibrations with a short duration can still produce a tone, challenging the idea that a series of waves is necessary for sound production.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
