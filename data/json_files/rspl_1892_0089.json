They found that the heart rhythm varies directly with the temperature of the surrounding medium, and certain drugs like caffeine and digitalin can affect the heart's rhythm and strength. These findings provide insights into the physiology of the embryonic heart and its response to environmental and chemical factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
