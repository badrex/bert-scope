They also discovered that the lift on a bent plane is much greater than on its chord, making bent planes more efficient. As the length of the front plane increases, the total lift decreases, but the lift-to-drift ratio increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
