They review dislocation damping models and consider an organized microstructure with dislocations inside subgrain walls, explaining the magnitude and frequency range of seismic attenuation. The model provides a physical framework for understanding the relationship between the quality factor and viscosity through the dislocation microstructure of the mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
