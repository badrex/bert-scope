They used a simple apparatus and various thermometers to measure the temperature changes. The results provided a rough method for estimating the absolute rate of conduction and contributed to the understanding of ice's conductive properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology and Cryology"}
