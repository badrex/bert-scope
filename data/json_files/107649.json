He discovers that the elasticity of these vapors increases significantly with temperature, making them powerful sources of mechanical energy. This research has implications for practical applications, such as using changes in temperature to produce mechanical motion without the need for large amounts of fuel.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
