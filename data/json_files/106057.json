The instrument is made of ivory or wood and can be used with jars or batteries. It is a significant improvement over previous methods of measuring electricity, providing greater accuracy and ease of use. The author also shares some of the electrical experiments performed by Henly, including the imitation of earthquake effects using lateral force of explosions and the electrification of sealing wax using a tin foil rubber.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
