They provide explicit results for one barrier and an infinite system of uniformly spaced barriers, and discuss various physically illuminating approximations. This model can be generalized to different pore shapes and is proposed as a convenient model for fitting experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
