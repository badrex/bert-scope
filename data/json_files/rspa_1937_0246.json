The authors, W. Payman and D. W. Woodhead, use photographic records to study the atmospheric disturbance and mode of breakdown of the explosive cartridge during detonation. They also examine the solid particles sent out by the detonating explosive and how they affect the shock wave and expansion of gases. The study provides insights into the behavior of shock waves and explosion products from different types of explosives, such as Rounkol No. 2 and Celmonite.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
