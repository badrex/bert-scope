It discusses how mechanical signals, such as touch and wind, affect plant growth and development by elevating cytosolic calcium concentrations. The authors also investigate the involvement of intracellular calcium in the perception and transduction of mechanical signals in plants, using molecular genetic approaches. They highlight the importance of understanding how calcium mediates specific responses to different signals and the need for targeted screening protocols to isolate vital components of the mechanical signal transduction pathway in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
