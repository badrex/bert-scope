They treat the charged liquid and its environment as a heterogeneous system in thermodynamic equilibrium and consider the effects of a small virtual variation in the shape of the conducting-liquid surface. The derivation applies to the static equilibrium situation and provides a deeper understanding of the thermodynamics of voltage sources and capacitance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
