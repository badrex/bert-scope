They discovered that solar heat causes the formation of flowers-shaped figures within the ice, which are composed of water. The author also found that ice is optically uniaxial, with the axis being perpendicular to the surface of freezing. The experiments have implications for understanding absorption and the molecular structure of ice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
