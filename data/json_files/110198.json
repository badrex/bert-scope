He reviewed previous works on the subject and conducted experiments to determine the forces required for dragging different materials along a horizontal surface and the angle at which a plane needed to be inclined for a body to slide down. Rennie found that friction varies depending on the materials, their pressure, and the extent of their surface contact. He also studied the effect of unguents on friction and provided detailed results in a tabular form.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
