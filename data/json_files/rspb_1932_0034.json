The experiments showed that the induced melanistic traits were inherited in subsequent generations. This study aimed to understand the occurrence of melanism in Lepidoptera species in industrial areas where plants might be contaminated with metallic fumes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
