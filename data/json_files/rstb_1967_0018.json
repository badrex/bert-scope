The algae's abundance and composition were examined in over ninety snow samples, revealing no significant differences in species composition or metabolic activity between red, yellow, and green snow. The author also investigated the vertical distribution of the algae and measured their carbon dioxide fixation, suggesting that the increase in cell numbers at the firn snow surface is more a result of concentration due to ablation than cell multiplication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
