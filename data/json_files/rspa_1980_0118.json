They use large-activation energy asymptotics to derive a theory that shows the relation between the mass flux of reactants through the flameholder and the burnt-gas temperature. The flameholder's conductance plays a significant role in the equilibrium between the flame and the flameholder, affecting the flame's behavior and stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Combustion and Flame"}
