They discovered that when iron and nickel are subjected to magnetic force, their resistance to electric conduction changes. The resistance of nickel decreases when magnetized transversely and increases when magnetized longitudinally, while the resistance of iron decreases when magnetized longitudinally and increases when magnetized transversely. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between magnetism and conductivity in materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
