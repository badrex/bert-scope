Hevesy's work on radioactive isotopes as tracers in biological processes and his discovery of the element hafnium are discussed. Thomson's contributions to atomic physics, particularly his investigation of the wave properties of the electron, are also mentioned. Lastly, Peters' research on the role of vitamin Bx in tissue metabolism and his discovery of the synthetic compound B.A.L. are celebrated. These scientists' work has significantly impacted the fields of biochemistry, atomic physics, and practical therapeutics."}
