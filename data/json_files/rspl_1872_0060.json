Norman Lockyer, conducted experiments to study the effect of light on the resistance of selenium and its connection with the solar spectrum. He discovered that selenium's resistance decreases significantly when exposed to sunlight, and the effect is most pronounced in the red rays. This research contributes to understanding the solar spectrum and the behavior of elements under different light conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
