G. Lillie during Captain Scott's Antarctic expedition. The plants are determined to be of Mesozoic age, either late Triassic (Rhaetian) or early Jurassic period. The discovery of these plants contributes to understanding the geological age and the possible connection of New Zealand to the Gondwana supercontinent.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
