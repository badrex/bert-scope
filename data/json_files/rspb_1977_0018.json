They found that a protein with the same immunological determinant as pig plasma amine oxidase is present in the connective tissue of all organs studied. This discovery highlights the close relationship between plasma and connective tissue amine oxidases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Histology"}
