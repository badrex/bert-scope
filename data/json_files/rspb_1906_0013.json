They discovered that the appearance of colored flowers is due to the presence of two factors from distinct allelomorphic pairs, while hoariness is determined by the coexistence of two other factors. The researchers found that the Mendelian system explains the observed results, and \"reversion\" is an orderly phenomenon caused by the meeting of factors from complementary allelomorphic pairs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
