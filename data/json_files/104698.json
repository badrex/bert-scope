Baker, Mr. William Arderon describes the extreme heat experienced in Norwich during July 1749. He provides thermometer readings and details how the heat affected the environment and people. The hottest day recorded was July 11th, with temperatures reaching 11 degrees above the heat of human blood in direct sunlight. Arderon also compares this heatwave to the one in 1748, noting that the 1749 heatwave was more gradual and less intense.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate"}
