It describes the method used, which involved applying pocky matter to a blister created by a small vesicatory. The author mentions that those who were inoculated recovered, and most had only a small number of pustules. The experience in Geneva led to the conjecture that the incision should be deeper when using older pocky matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Public Health"}
