They found that the production and maintenance of the amorphous phase is under biological control and may play a role in pH regulation and metal ion sequestration in plants. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of amorphous biominerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
