Short's telescopes were used in various astronomical observations, including the first observation of a lunar eclipse by George Graham and Short himself. Short also collaborated with John Harrison on the problem of longitude and was involved in the testing of Harrison's timekeeper, H4. Despite facing competition from John Dollond's achromatic telescope, Short's work continued to be recognized and appreciated by the scientific community.", "scientific_discipline": "History of Science > Astronomy"}
