They found that attaching severed roots of the brachial plexus to another root or a nerve not belonging to the plexus could help restore muscle function. The author also investigated the distribution of nerve fibers in the roots of the plexus and discussed the importance of understanding this distribution for successful anastomosis procedures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
