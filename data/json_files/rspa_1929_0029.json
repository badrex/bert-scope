The author found that there are upper and lower temperature limits for the photosynthetic process, and the temperature coefficient is similar to that of the living alga Chlorella. The results support the view that the complete activation of carbonic acid occurs in two stages: partial activation by adsorption on the catalyst surface and a second activation by visible light.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
