It demonstrates that the set of derivative strings of a given degree and length over a manifold forms a vector bundle associated with a principal bundle of nth-order frames. An analogous result is shown for differential strings. The article also reviews non-holonomic and semi-holonomic jets and explains how derivative and differential strings can be obtained from semi-holonomic jets of certain tensor fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
