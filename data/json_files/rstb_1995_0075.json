It finds high heritability estimates for various color pattern elements and reveals negative genetic covariances between the elytral spot and pronotal spots. The results suggest that natural selection may act to optimize the combined anti-predator effect of the color patterns by regulating melanin production rates. The study also finds no evidence of sex-linked gene expression for color pattern, although female color patterns may be influenced by maternally inherited factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
