They concluded that the cloud chamber data is consistent with Janossy's counter data and the theory of meson production proposed by Heitler and Peng. The study also provided insight into the possible production of small groups of mesons in succession, which could explain the observed phenomena of penetrating showers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
