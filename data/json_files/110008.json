He presents three drawings of seal skulls from different locations and suggests that the variation in teeth form may be due to the different types of shellfish they consume. This study aims to help identify and differentiate between seal species when encountering their fossil remains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Comparative anatomy"}
