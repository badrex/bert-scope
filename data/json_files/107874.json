Through a series of experiments, he determined the atomic weight of chromium and the composition of its green and brown oxides. He also found a method to convert chromic acid into green oxide and discovered a new compound, hydrosulphuret of chromium. These findings contributed to the understanding of chromium chemistry and atomic weight determination."}
