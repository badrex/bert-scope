They discovered that B-type horizontal cells show strong tracer coupling between their dendritic trees and axonal arborizations, suggesting that these cells are electrically coupled. This finding establishes a similarity in coupling patterns between axon-bearing horizontal cells in mammalian and non-mammalian retinae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
