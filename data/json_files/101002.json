They observed that sap ascends in trees due to factors like gravity and tree posture. The authors also discovered that the ascent of sap is not solely due to the narrowness of pores, as water in glass pipes would not fall out again by its own gravity. They found that the sap ascends through the wood and between the bark and the tree. The authors also studied the effect of environmental factors like temperature on sap movement and observed that cold weather slows down the movement of sap.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
