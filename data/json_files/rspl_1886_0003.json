They discovered that the thyroid gland plays a crucial role in controlling mucin metabolism and hemapoiesis. The removal of the gland causes symptoms similar to old age, such as wasting, atrophy, and falling out of hair, decay of teeth, and dryness of the skin. The study also found that the temperature at which animals are kept after thyroidectomy influences the course of symptoms, with higher temperatures prolonging the duration of life and modifying the symptoms."}
