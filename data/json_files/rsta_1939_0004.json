The authors conducted precise measurements using interferometry and Fabry-Perot etalons to determine the refractive index of air under controlled conditions of temperature, pressure, and composition. The research aimed to improve the accuracy of previous measurements and provide a better understanding of the relationship between refractive index, density, and dispersion of transparent media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
