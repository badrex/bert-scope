The authors calculate the electrostatic energy of the interlayer and examine the influence of interlayer ions and water molecules on the intercalation process. The study provides insights into the energetics of intercalation compounds and the factors affecting the incorporation of water molecules and exchangeable cations within the interlayer of silicates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography and Mineralogy"}
