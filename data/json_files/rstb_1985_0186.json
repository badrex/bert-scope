The authors summarize what has been learned about the developmental potential and lineage of cells in the early embryo, focusing on the different tissues of the later conceptus and postnatal mouse. They also explore the use of genetically determined presence versus absence of cytoplasmic malic enzyme activity as a marker system for investigating cell deployment within certain tissues of the conceptus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
