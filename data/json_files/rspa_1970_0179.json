The research extends previous theories to include larger corner angles and provides numerical solutions for various angles, revealing that the pressure fall downstream of the corner becomes relatively less as the angle increases. The findings contribute to a better understanding of boundary layer behavior in complex flow situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
