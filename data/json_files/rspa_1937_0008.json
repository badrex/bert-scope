They found that the central component of the spectrum was split into three due to even isotope displacement, and they analyzed the fine structures of thirty-six lines in the region XX 6800-4320. The results showed satisfactory agreement with previous studies, providing insights into the atomic structure and properties of platinum isotopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
