The research finds that typical mineral lubricating oils do not exhibit elastic properties and their behavior can be explained by considering viscosity in terms of pressure, temperature, and location. Two other oils with higher initial viscosity and pressure coefficient of viscosity show anomalous behavior, suggesting they may be viscoelastic.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
