They discovered that the characteristic bands in the flame are due to molecular sulfur (S2) and sulfur monoxide (SO). Additionally, they detected carbonyl sulfide (COS) in the flame, which could help determine its presence or absence in the CS2 flame.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
