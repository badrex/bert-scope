It shows that at most 2 transonic states can be exceptional, and there are precisely 4 combinations of exceptional transonic states involving only 3 of the 6 types. The study provides necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of these combinations and offers a complete characterization of exceptional transonic states in elastic materials with hexagonal symmetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Elasticity"}
