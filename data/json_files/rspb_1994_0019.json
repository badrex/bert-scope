They consider the effects of interference and resource depletion on density-dependent mortality and use this model to predict the population decline resulting from habitat loss. The study highlights the importance of understanding individual interactions in predicting the consequences of environmental changes on populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
