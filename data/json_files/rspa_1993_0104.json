They apply the Lagally theorem to determine the induced velocity of self-propulsion and demonstrate the results for prolate and oblate spheroidal shapes. The study shows that non-spherical shapes can propel themselves persistently through the fluid due to resonant interactions between shape and volume modes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
