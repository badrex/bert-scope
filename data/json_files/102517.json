Cassini's observations led him to believe that there has been no significant alteration, while others disagreed. The article also mentions the role of the Meridian Line in calculating refractions and the importance of accurate observations for astronomical studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
