The author, W.M. Bayliss, examines the behavior of particles in protoplasm under dark-ground illumination and discusses the implications of this phenomenon in cell biology. The study also investigates the effects of electrical stimulation on protoplasm, revealing the reversible gelation as a regular condition of cell activities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
