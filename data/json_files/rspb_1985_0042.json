These generalizations include the species scaling law, link scaling law, and link-species scaling law. The model assumes that species are ordered in a cascade or hierarchy, where a given species can only prey on those below it and be preyed on by those above it. The model successfully accounts for the observed generalizations and provides a simple explanation for the structure of community food webs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
