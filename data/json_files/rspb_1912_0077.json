They found that liver press juice can reduce methemoglobin and decompose hydrogen peroxide, suggesting the presence of both catalase and reductase enzymes. The study also showed that the reducing activity of the juice decreases over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
