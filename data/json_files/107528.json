F. Mornay discovered a massive block of native iron in Brazil, which had been resting on a bed of similar material. The block was 7 feet long, 4 feet wide, and 3 feet thick, and was magnetically charged with well-defined poles. Mornay analyzed the iron's properties and shared samples with other scientists, sparking further research into the origins and composition of this unique mass.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
