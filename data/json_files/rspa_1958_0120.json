They explore the relationship between the ionization potential of the metal atom and the azide's explosive properties, as well as the role of heat in initiating explosions. The study highlights the importance of understanding the differences in bonding and decomposition mechanisms between inorganic azides and organic azides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
