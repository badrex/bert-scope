The analysis, which is computer-assisted, provides a quantitative description of exopodite beating patterns and cycle durations. The results show that beating patterns are consistent across all three stages, with stage III having shorter cycle durations than stages I and II. The research contributes to understanding the control mechanisms of rhythmic activities in developing lobster larvae and their implications for neurobiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
