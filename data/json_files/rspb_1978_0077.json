The research demonstrates that the endosymbiotic cyanobacteria are within host cell vacuoles and have a highly reduced prokaryotic cell wall. The study also shows that the host, Cyanophora paradoxa, is an obligate phototroph, meaning it relies solely on photosynthesis for its nutrition. The findings suggest a well-integrated mutually obligate symbiosis between the two organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
