It explores the carbon-bearing material in these stars' outflows, the chemistry in their extended envelopes, and the role of solid dust grains in the mass loss process. The study focuses on the carbon-rich stars losing a large amount of mass, which serve as a fascinating laboratory for understanding celestial carbon chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrochemistry"}
