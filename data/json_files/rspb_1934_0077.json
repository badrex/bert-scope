They found that the strength of the Orbeli response, which occurs when sympathetic nerves are stimulated, is dependent on the concentration of a chemical intermediary and the sensitivity of the muscle's motor end-organs to the intermediary. The author also discovered a relationship between a muscle's adrenaline sensitivity and its response to sympathetic stimulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
