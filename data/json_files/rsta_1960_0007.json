The authors discuss the harmonic oscillations of model atmospheres and the representation of the wave system generated by an explosion as a Fourier integral. They also explore the energy partitioning in a blast wave and the efficiency of rising motion in producing gravity waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Meteorology"}
