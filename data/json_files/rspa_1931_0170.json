They propose a geometrical interpretation of the term in the wave equation, which involves the radius of the universe and the number of electrons in it. This interpretation provides an alternative expression for the cosmical constant and suggests that the mass of an electron is an interchange energy with other charges in the universe, suitably averaged.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
