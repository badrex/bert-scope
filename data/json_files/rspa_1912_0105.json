They discovered that the bulk of the effect is due to a direct transformation of the energy of the cathode rays into characteristic X-rays, while the indirect action suggested by Barkla and Sadler is a small remainder. The direct and indirect effects happen simultaneously when the speed of the cathode rays exceeds a definite value.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
