It mentions Mr. Heaviside's work on rotational aether, Professor J. J. Thomson's method of representing electric fields, and Professor Oliver Lodge's search for a magnetic field's effect on light velocity. Additionally, it highlights William Gannon's research on copper electrolysis in vacuo and Arthur Schuster's communication on the same topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
