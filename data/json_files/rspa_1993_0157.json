They use conformal mapping and Laurent series expansion of complex potentials to analyze the problem. The resulting expressions are universal and applicable to various loading conditions and geometries. The study provides general explicit forms of the complex potentials in both the transformed and physical planes, which can be used to solve more complex problems involving inclusions and defects in materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
