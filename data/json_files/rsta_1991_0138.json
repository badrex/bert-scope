The authors find that the outflow is significantly larger than the volume of fluid released by compaction processes. They also discuss the influence of fluids in subduction zones, including the role of deep water convection and the smectite-illite transformation in water production.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Geophysics"}
