They observe that the gas's lines do not vary equally, suggesting the presence of multiple compounds. The author also notes the behavior of the gas in a vacuum tube, with lines appearing and disappearing at different stages of heating. This study contributes to the understanding of the composition and behavior of gases in minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
