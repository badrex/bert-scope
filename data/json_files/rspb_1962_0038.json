They found that three of the organisms, including Nocardia coeliaca, Pseudomonas sp., and Micrococcus sp., effectively degraded the side-chain of the acids. The study provides insights into the metabolism of phenoxyalkanecarboxylic acids by microorganisms in soil.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
