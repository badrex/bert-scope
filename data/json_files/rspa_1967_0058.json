The author explains how circular dichroic bands can be related to the helical conformation of polynucleotides and how the exciton theory can help explain the optical activity of these structures. The article also explores the conformation of dimers and oligomers, providing insights into the structure of polynucleotides and the potential applications of circular dichroism in studying them.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
