The study found that the ovary plays a crucial role in the process, and the mechanism involves the production of a luteotropic substance by the developing embryo's trophoblast, which in turn affects the corpus luteum and leads to the disappearance of the X zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
