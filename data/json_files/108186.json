They discovered that the force originating from the active zinc center diffused evenly over the entire sphere, and the distribution of the force remained the same regardless of the position of the generating metal. The author also found that increasing the surface area of the generating metal had a minimal effect on the overall force.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
