The platypus is sensitive to electrical waveforms that mimic the electromyogenic potentials of fleeing prey, and it responds with a directionally tuned reflex. The research also discusses the integration of electro-sensory capacities into foraging strategies and platypus husbandry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
