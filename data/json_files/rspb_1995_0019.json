The dynamics depend on the rate of beneficial mutations and the strength of natural selection. This study complements experimental studies of adaptation and divergence, providing insights into the predictability of evolution and the potential for divergence within populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
