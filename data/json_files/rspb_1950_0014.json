The division discovered that sheep grazing on deficient soils suffered from a dual deficiency of cobalt and copper, which could be resolved by supplementing their diet with these elements. This research led to improvements in the health and productivity of sheep in challenging environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Nutrition"}
