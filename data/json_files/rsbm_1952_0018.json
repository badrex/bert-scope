He made significant contributions to the fields of electrodynamics, quantum mechanics, and mathematical physics. His work on diffraction problems and collaboration with Felix Klein on the theory of spinning tops are considered classics in their respective fields. Sommerfeld's influence on the younger generation of scientists and his dedication to both pure and applied mathematics made him a pioneer in modern theoretical physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Theoretical Physics"}
