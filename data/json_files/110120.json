He found that a magnetic needle exposed to the sun's rays came to rest more quickly than when exposed to shade. This discovery indicated a magnetic influence in the solar rays, which was not due to changes in temperature. The author also discussed the effect of temperature on the needle's magnetism and compared it to the influence of the sun's rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solar Physics"}
