They found that low Sherwood and Nusselt numbers reported in previous studies could be caused by intraphase diffusion in the washcoat. The study provides insights into the steady-state kinetics and temperature profiles of CO oxidation in tubular wall reactors, which can help improve the efficiency of catalytic combustion reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
