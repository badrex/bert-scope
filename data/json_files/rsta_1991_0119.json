The authors develop an elementary step model that accounts for the oscillations and demonstrate that it can be applied to this system. The model considers the interactions between gas-phase and surface concentrations, providing a better understanding of the synchronized behavior of metal particles on the catalyst.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
