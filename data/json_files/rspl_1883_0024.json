They prepared pure metallic glucinum and used a modified Regnault's method of mixtures to obtain accurate results. The specific heat of glucinum was found to be around 0.06, which helped in determining its atomic weight. Additionally, a new type of crinoid, Themmatocrinus renovatus, was discovered at a depth of 1,800 fathoms in the Southern Sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metal chemistry"}
