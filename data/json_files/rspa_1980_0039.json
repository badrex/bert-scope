The study includes excitation and ionization by single-electron collisions with neutral molecules, considering both electron attachment and detachment. Fluid-type momentum equations describe the motion of positive and negative ions and electrons. The analysis reveals that the radial distribution of negative ions in the column is significantly different from that of positive ions and electrons, due to the inwardly directed drift velocity of negative ions. The high concentration of negative ions near the central region of the discharge column depends on the ratio of attachment to detachment rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
