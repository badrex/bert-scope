The authors examine the effects of physical dimensions, initial temperature, and liquid depth on the rate of flame spread. They also explore the impact of varying the channel width and the addition of small percentages of water as a diluent. The research provides a better understanding of the mechanisms controlling flame spread and has implications for fire safety and the design of fire-resistant materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fire Science"}
