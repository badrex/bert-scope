They found that the Schwann cell is the source of acetylcholine packages that evoke miniature end-plate potentials in denervated muscle. The presence of the Schwann cell is necessary but not sufficient for the production of miniature potentials at denervated end-plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
