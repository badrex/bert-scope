They use statistical mechanical methods to study the effects of lateral interactions between near-neighbour particles on the desorption kinetics while the adlayer stoichiometry varies continuously during a desorption sweep. The study provides insights into the desorption behavior of nitric oxide adlayers on transition metal surfaces, which is important for understanding the underlying processes in observed spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
