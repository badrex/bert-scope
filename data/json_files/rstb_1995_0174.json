The researchers developed four models with different types of orientation-contrast-sensitive modules to mimic the functionality of certain cortical cells. Model 4, containing both types of orientation-contrast-sensitive modules, successfully accounted for human performance in segmentation and detection tasks. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms of early visual processing and the development of artificial models for image analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Processing"}
