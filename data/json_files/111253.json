Lowe, introduces a new method of propagating plants using collodion to seal the base of cuttings, reducing the risk of failure and improving the success rate of plant propagation. The experiment shows that cuttings treated with collodion had twice the success rate compared to traditional methods. The author also mentions the potential benefits of this method in pruning, budding, and grafting, as well as its effect on preserving the freshness of cut flowers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
