They present a theoretical treatment based on a proposed criterion for crack formation, assuming that cracks form when the negative hydrostatic pressure component of the applied stress reaches a critical value. The theory successfully predicts the observed dependence of cracking stress on the rubber's Young's modulus, its virtual independence of rubber strength and extensibility, and the general form of the observed variation of cracking stress and crack disposition with the thickness of the test-piece.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
