The researchers found that proteins preferentially adsorb to charged oil/water interfaces, causing flocculation of oil droplets. The flocculation is pH-dependent and can be reversed by changing the pH. The adsorption and desorption process can change the structure of the protein molecule, as demonstrated with haemoglobin. The study also shows that this mechanism can separate proteins and has potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloid Chemistry"}
