They found that the nuclear spin of sodium could be established by resolving the hyperfine structure lines in a strong magnetic field. The results were compared with quantum mechanical theory, showing perfect agreement up to the limit of experimental accuracy. This study provided a more accurate test of the theory over a greater range of field strengths than previous research on thallium."}
