They use experimental data to calculate the number of magnetic carriers and compare the results with the saturation magnetization. The study helps in understanding the behavior of ferromagnetic materials and choosing the appropriate theoretical approach for each substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
