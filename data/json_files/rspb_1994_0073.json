The patient's spectral responses and color naming for stimuli presented to their 'blind' hemifield were examined, revealing normal spectral response characteristics. The patient was able to perform forced-choice color discrimination with large stimuli, even without conscious perception of color, suggesting the presence of 'blindsight.'", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Perception"}
