They determined relative cross-sections for producing mercury ions in specific energy states and found that autoionized states above the 2 * * *D| limit decay to the 2Sj and 2 *D j states of the ion with approximately equal probability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
