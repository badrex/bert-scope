The authors describe the crystal structure of papain, its active site, and the role of its disulfide bridges. They also compare papain's structure to other proteolytic enzymes like chymotrypsin and subtilisin, highlighting their common features.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure and Function"}
