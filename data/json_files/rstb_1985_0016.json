The animals were tested in a naturalistic environment with multiple objects and were found to have exceptional learning and memory capabilities. They demonstrated the ability to create cognitive maps and use win-stay, lose-shift strategies when searching for food. These findings suggest that tamarins have advanced cognitive abilities that may be related to their unique foraging strategies in the wild.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
