The authors identify various elements present in the flames, including rubidium, caesium, calcium, copper, silver, and gallium. They also study the differences in the spectra of flames from open-hearth and cupola furnaces, providing insights into the chemistry of these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
