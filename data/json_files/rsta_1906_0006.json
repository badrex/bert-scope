They used advanced apparatus to measure the pressure, volume, and temperature of the gases, as well as the amount of water formed and the heat generated during the explosion. The research aimed to improve understanding of the properties and behavior of these explosives, which could be useful for their practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
