This method involves using a table and two solutions to interpolate the hour-angle, altitude, and azimuth. The author finds this method to be easier and less fatiguing than the traditional method. They plan to publish a paper with practical directions and examples to help others assess the usefulness of this method.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Navigation"}
