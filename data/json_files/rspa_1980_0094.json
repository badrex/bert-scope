The study assumes a large shear layer Reynolds number and considers both nonlinear and viscous flow in the critical layer. The complex wave amplitude is shown to satisfy a nonlinear evolution equation, which is essential for understanding the behavior of waves in shear layers. The findings have implications for the growth and development of instability waves in fluid dynamics."}
