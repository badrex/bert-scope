The results show that the low-temperature specific heat of ferromagnetic alloys can be represented by an equation that includes electronic, lattice, and spin-wave contributions. The findings indicate that the presence of a spin-wave contribution is less certain for nickel-copper alloys due to the greater scatter in the values. For nickel-iron alloys, a spin-wave contribution is more evident, with values similar to those deduced by other methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
