The authors discuss the two-stage subsidence model, which involves rapid initial subsidence due to crustal thinning and loading, followed by a more protracted thermal stage as the lithosphere relaxes to equilibrium thickness. They analyze the genetic significance of different facies associations in terms of various basin formation models and evaluate the significance of sedimentary thicknesses in terms of lithosphere thickness.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Sedimentary basins and sequences"}
