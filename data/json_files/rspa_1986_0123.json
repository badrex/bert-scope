The four main types of shock-wave reflection - regular, single-Mach, complex-Mach, and double-Mach - were observed and analyzed. The results provide insight into the complex-flow fields and help establish the transition boundaries between different types of shock-wave reflections. The study also highlights the importance of real-gas effects in non-stationary shock-wave systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
