The author explores how the fossil record can provide insights into present-day biotic losses and highlights the importance of understanding extinction patterns in the context of the Big Five mass extinctions. The article also examines extinction metrics and their limitations, as well as the challenges of estimating species-level extinction using reverse rarefaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Biodiversity"}
