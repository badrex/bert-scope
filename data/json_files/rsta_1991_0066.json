They suggest that the turbulent wall region can be divided into hierarchies of eddies with different length scales and velocity scales. The attached eddy hypothesis is consistent with dimensional analysis results and can explain the mean velocity, turbulence intensity, Reynolds shear stress, and turbulence energy spectra in turbulent boundary layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
