They discovered that heat-contraction is caused by the heat-coagulation of different proteins in the muscle tissue. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of muscle contraction and the role of proteins in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
