They apply this model to the major transitions in evolution, such as the origin of protocell genomes and the emergence of metakaryotic cells. The reformulation uses standard branching processes to analyze the full dynamics of the population of compartments, allowing for a more rigorous understanding of related problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
