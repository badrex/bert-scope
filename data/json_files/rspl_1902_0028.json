They found that land, its thickness, contour, height, and nature significantly reduce the maximum distance of signaling. The author also observed that the curvature of the Earth has no effect on the signals at the distances covered in their experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telecommunications"}
