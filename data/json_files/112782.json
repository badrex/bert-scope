The study focuses on the measurements of univalve shells and the relationships between the elongation of the radius vector, the linear expansion of the generating figure, and the translation or slipping of the spiral on the central axis. The findings reveal five possible combinations of these factors, leading to different shell forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
