They find that the constants representing electron currents are influenced by the nature and pressure of the surrounding gas. A linear relationship exists between these constants and the gas pressure, which applies to both electron and ion emissions. This research provides a better understanding of the behavior of metals in various gaseous environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
