The theory is based on Schr\u00f6dinger's equation and considers assemblies with multiple types of recognizably distinct systems. The author also discusses the calculation of the equilibrium state, external reactions, entropy, and temperature in this new form of statistical mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
