It discusses the role of slope turbulence, internal waves, and mixing processes in influencing phytoplankton growth. The study reveals that increased mixing at the shelf-break leads to a wider separation of isopycnals, resulting in a more favorable environment for phytoplankton growth due to the release of nutrients and light energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
