The results show that motor and sensory fibres have different sensitivities to potassium channel blockade, with ventral roots showing a decrease in the effects earlier in the maturation process. This indicates differences in the functional organization of potassium channels in motor and sensory axons, which may have implications for coding properties between these two classes of axons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
