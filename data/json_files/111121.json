He discovered that the plant contains two main compounds: scoparine, a diuretic principle, and sparteine, a volatile organic base with narcotic properties. The research also found that a greater number of plants can yield nitropicric acid than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
