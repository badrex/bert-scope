The author examines the process of learning and imitation in birds, focusing on the example of the Chaffinch and the Tree Pipit. The article also explores the complex duet patterns of the Tropical Bou-bou Shrike, Laniarius aethiopicus, and how these patterns are worked out between mated pairs during a long practice period. The author suggests that these duets reveal a highly sophisticated ritualization of song patterns, with details that are largely unrelated to innate factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
