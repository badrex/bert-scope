They found that the energies of excitation in both molecules are almost equal, and the frequency of the symmetric valence vibration of SeO2 is similar to that of SeO in their respective ground and excited states. The study provides insights into the constitution of diatomic molecules and the periodic system of elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
