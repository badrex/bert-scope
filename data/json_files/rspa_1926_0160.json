They use X-ray analysis to determine the arrangement of silicon and oxygen atoms in tridymite, finding that it has a unique structure distinct from quartz and cristobalite. This research contributes to the understanding of silica polymorphism and its various applications in industries such as glass and clay.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
