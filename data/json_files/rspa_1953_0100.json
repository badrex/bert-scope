They applied the calculation to the case of air and compared the results with experimental data. The study supports the view that photo-ionization does not play a predominant role as a secondary ionization process leading to the electrical breakdown of air at values of the spark parameter em mm Hg in uniform fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
