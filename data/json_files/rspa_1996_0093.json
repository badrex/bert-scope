The author derives an expression for the radiation resistance per unit span for a general velocity distribution on the plate and provides detailed analysis for the simplest case. The results can be applied to estimate the flow of acoustic energy into the fluid for complex interacting structures, such as aircraft in air.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Acoustics and Vibration"}
