Aston worked with J.J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory, where he made important discoveries in positive rays and helped develop the parabola method for identifying different atoms and atomic groupings. He also conducted research on the dark space, rare gases, and the potential distribution in that region. Aston's work laid the foundation for the development of mass spectrometry and his discoveries had a significant impact on the field of atomic physics."}
