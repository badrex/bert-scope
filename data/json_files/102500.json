The instrument allows for precise readings down to the thousandth part of an inch. Gray also suggests a similar improvement for thermometers, requiring a longer microscope and a longer tube to avoid the influence of the thermometer's warm effluvia on the observer's judgment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Measurement and Instrumentation"}
