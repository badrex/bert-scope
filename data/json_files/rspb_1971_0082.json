They discovered that during dark-light adaptation, the retinula cell bodies move away from the cone and form a crystalline tract. This movement is crucial for the beetle's vision and helps them adjust to different lighting environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
