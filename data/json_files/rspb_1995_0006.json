They discover multiple evolutionary attractors, including a system with two prey and two predator species in an alternating pattern. This pattern is maintained indefinitely and demonstrates complex oscillations in both evolutionary and population dynamics. The authors also observe predator and prey chasing behavior, which they attribute to Red Queen dynamics and surrounding and escaping behavior in cyclic phenotype space.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
