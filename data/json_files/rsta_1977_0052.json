The authors find that high-Ti basalts are hybrid liquids resulting from the assimilation of subcrustal Ti-rich material by a parental magma of low-Ti type, while low-Ti basalts originate as a spectrum of partial melts from a previously differentiated olivine-pyroxenite lunar mantle. The study provides insights into the chemical and mineralogical composition of the Moon's surface and its geological history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
