The divers experienced minor symptoms of high-pressure nervous syndrome during compression but no major medical or physiological issues at maximum depth. Three decompression sickness incidents occurred, all successfully treated. The study highlighted the need for improvements in breathing equipment, thermal protection, and communication to ensure diver safety during high-pressure dives.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
