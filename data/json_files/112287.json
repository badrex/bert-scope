They observed that metals like wrought iron, cast iron, and steel undergo significant changes in form, while metals like tin, brass, gun-metal, and zinc show slight expansion. The results provide insights into the behavior of metals during heat treatment and contribute to the understanding of material science and metallurgy.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
