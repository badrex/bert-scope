The authors consider various factors that can affect the analysis, such as specimen preparation, microscope operation, and background extrapolation. They determine the composition of the metastable precipitation-hardening phase in the temperature range and show its non-stoichiometry, which is essential for understanding the strengthening behavior of Al-Li base alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
