They conclude that crust-stretching and folding are most significant in continental areas, particularly along coastlines with rapid slopes towards ocean depths, where earthquake and volcanic activity is prevalent. This study sheds light on the evolution of the Earth's surface and the formation of older rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
