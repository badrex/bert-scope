They analyze the efficiency of the recoil engine and the steam engine, comparing their performance and efficiency. The author concludes that the recoil engine is not efficient and suggests that the water wheel and pressure engine are better alternatives in certain situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical engineering"}
