They highlight his experimental approach and his influence on the understanding of atomic structure, radioactive decay, and the study of elementary particles. Rutherford's work laid the foundation for the application of wave mechanics to the nucleus and the development of new experimental techniques, such as the cloud chamber and counter-controlled cloud chamber.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
