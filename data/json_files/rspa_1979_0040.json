They found that the relaxation times assigned to the micellization-dissolution process could be obtained from the traces of conductance changes in a wider concentration range than previous methods. The results showed that the relaxation times decreased with increasing concentration and increased with temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Chemistry"}
