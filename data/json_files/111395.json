The placenta has an annular form and resembles the annular or zonular placenta of the Hyrax and Cat. The author also discusses the foetal membranes, umbilical cord, and allantois, highlighting the presence of numerous flattened oval or subcircular bodies on the inner layer of the allantois. The study emphasizes the combination of two forms of the placenta in the Elephant, which has implications for placental classification in mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy and Reproduction"}
