They also provided indirect evidence that the activity of other infra-red absorption bands, if present, is too small to be demonstrated experimentally. This research contributes to the understanding of the behavior of light in quartz and the potential for future study in this area.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
