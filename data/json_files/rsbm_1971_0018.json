He worked closely with Geiger and Rutherford, assisting in experiments that led to the discovery of the nuclear structure of the atom. Marsden's work on the scattering of alpha particles and the projection of hydrogen particles through hydrogen gas helped support Rutherford's nuclear theory. Despite his early death, Marsden's impact on the field of physics remains profound.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
