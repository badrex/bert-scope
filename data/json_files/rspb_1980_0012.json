They found that the cross-bridges between actin and myosin interact with approximately one-third of the actin monomers and have a strong preference for a particular orientation. The study provides a formal description of the structure of rigor muscle and helps interpret the diffraction pattern.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Structure and Function"}
