{"article_id": "rspb_1980_0126", "revised_title": "Neuroactive Peptides and Their Role in Thirst and Sodium Intake", "semantic_tags": ["Neurotransmitters", "Thirst regulation", "Sodium appetite", "Angiotensin II", "Renin-angiotensin system"], "tldr": "This article discusses the role of neuroactive peptides, particularly angiotensin II, in controlling water and sodium intake. It explains how angiotensin II, when injected into the brain, causes normal drinking behavior in various vertebrates, including mammals, birds, reptiles, and fish. The article also explores the involvement of angiotensin in hypovolaemic thirst and the potential role of other peptides in regulating these behaviors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
