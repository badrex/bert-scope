They explain the mathematical relationships of cyclic quantities and demonstrate how iron-cored electromagnets can help overcome the difficulties caused by varying permeability and hysteresis of the iron. This method leads to the development of more accurate electromagnetic instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
