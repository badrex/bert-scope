The author, E.J. Stone, analyzes the data and finds a close agreement between the curves of temperature and solar spot frequency, suggesting that a common cause may be responsible for both phenomena. The study also discusses the potential impact of systematic errors in the temperature measurements and the possible indirect relationship between temperature and solar spots.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
