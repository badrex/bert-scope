They identified new lines in the spectrum and analyzed the series lines using Ritz equations and Paschen's frequency formula. The study helped in understanding the characteristics of the mercury arc spectrum and the role of the lamp type in determining the spectrum's nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
