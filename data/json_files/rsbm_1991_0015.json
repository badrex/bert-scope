Born in 1903, Kolmogorov's early research focused on the descriptive theory of sets of points, Fourier series, and the convergence of summable functions. He later became known for his work on Markov processes, the strong law of large numbers, and the law of the iterated logarithm. Kolmogorov's foundational paper on probability theory, based on measure theory, introduced concepts such as elementary events, random events, and random variables. His lifelong friendship with Aleksandrov and his collaborations with other mathematicians, such as Khinchin and Frechet, played a significant role in his career. Kolmogorov's impact on the development of stochastic process theory and the analytical theory of branching processes is also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Probability Theory"}
