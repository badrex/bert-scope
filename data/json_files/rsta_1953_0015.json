The authors provide a new notation for symbols describing the irreducible representations of special unitary groups and tabulate the coefficients required for the calculations. This form of wave functions is suitable for evaluating two-body interactions and has been used in investigations on the effect of non-central forces on the levels of p-shell nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
