The camera uses a narrow beam of cathode rays, which pass through two fine pinholes and strike a crystalline target, creating divergent beams that ultimately strike a photographic plate. This device allows for the observation and analysis of electron diffraction patterns, providing valuable insights into the behavior of electrons and their interactions with crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
