The author, Peter W. Barlow, conducts experiments on various steamships and analyzes the impact of paddlewheel design on a vessel's speed and efficiency. He concludes that resistance is nearly proportional to the square of the velocity and provides recommendations for improving steam navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Engineering"}
