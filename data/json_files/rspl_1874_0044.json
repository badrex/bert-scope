The observations were made using a heliometer constructed by Fraunhofer, and the results were used to determine the precise instant of contact and the accuracy of the chronometer. The author also discussed the challenges faced during the observation and the importance of accurate timekeeping in astronomical studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational astronomy"}
