They propose a micro-chemical method using ammonium sulphide to detect iron in chromatin of various cell types. The study shows that iron is present in chromatin, but it is not combined as an albuminate. The author also mentions the potential applications of these findings and the need for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
