The authors study spark ignition and time lags, providing a method to determine the probability of electron emission and the work function of emitting sources. Their findings are important for understanding the initiation of discharges in various practical applications, such as spark ignition, surge and lightning arrestors, Geiger counters, and electrical contacts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
