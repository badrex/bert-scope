This new arrangement is especially suitable for use as a line-thermopile and offers simplicity and cost-effectiveness in construction. The author also describes a method to carry delicate Thomson cells without risking damage to the silk fiber suspension.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
