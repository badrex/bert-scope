The experiments reveal that mercury's strength increases at low temperatures, and its load-extension diagrams exhibit characteristics similar to those of other metals. The research also highlights the importance of considering the duration of tests at low temperatures due to the effect of \"creep\" on metals' tenacity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
