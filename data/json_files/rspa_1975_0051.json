They show that the free energy per spin can be written explicitly in terms of an algebraic hypergeometric function and derive recurrence relations for the coefficients in the low-temperature expansions. The study establishes the critical behavior of the free energy, internal energy, and specific heat in the neighborhood of the critical point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
