He described the appearance of a bright column of light with a uniform steady color, which sometimes vanished and reappeared. He also noticed three pyramids of light with a sea-green color emerging from clouds in the north-northwest. This observation contributed to the understanding of atmospheric and geomagnetic phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
