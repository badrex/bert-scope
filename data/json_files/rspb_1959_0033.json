They discovered that the cell wall consists of numerous lamellae made up of crystalline microfibrils embedded in an amorphous matrix. The microfibrils contain both glucose and xylose residues, and the cell wall can be stretched reversibly. The findings have implications for understanding the term cellulose and its composition in different organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
