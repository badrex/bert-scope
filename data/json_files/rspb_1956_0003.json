The main structural component of the wall is found to be cellulose II (mercerized cellulose) organized into microfibrils. The X-ray diagram closely resembles that of the green alga Ulothrix flacca. The wall is lamellated, and periodic inclusions appear to be cytoplasmic. The site of wall formation is suggested to be deeper in the cytoplasm. This research contributes to understanding cell-wall organization in red algae, which is important for the study of other plant groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
