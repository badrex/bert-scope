They discuss the incorporation of multiple glass plates into one block and suggest that this process is analogous to regelation in ice. The author also explores the molecular constitution and physical nature of glass, comparing it to a solution of different substances and a crystallizable salt in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Glass Physics"}
