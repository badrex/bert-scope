They found that the principal susceptibilities obeyed the Curie-Weiss law above a certain temperature, while at lower temperatures, one susceptibility became independent of temperature, and the other two increased rapidly. The magnetic ellipsoid rotated significantly as the temperature decreased. These findings have implications for the crystalline field theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
