The observations revealed evidence of stellar wind-driven accretion in some sources and provided insights into the nature of these binary systems. The data also detected new sources not previously identified by other satellites, suggesting that many unidentified sources in the Milky Way may also be in close binary systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > X-ray astronomy"}
