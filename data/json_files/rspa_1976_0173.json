Detailed calculations are provided for air and water flows, and the analysis is extended to predict heat transfer rates on plates of rectangular planforms. The study improves previous theoretical predictions and offers a better understanding of the flow's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Mechanics"}
