They discovered that the spectroscopic properties of sPCP depend on the apoprotein's structure and that two distinct forms of chlorophyll a are present in each holoprotein. This study provides insights into the molecular topologies of sPCP and their role in light-harvesting and energy transfer in dinoflagellates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis and Plant Physiology"}
