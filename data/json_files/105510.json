These coins were found in a collection brought from the East by Dr. Pococke. Swinton examines the workmanship and design of the coins, comparing them to other Parthian and Sassanian coins. He suggests that the coins may have been minted in a neighboring province under Parthian control and could provide valuable insights into the history of the Parthian Empire. The coins feature Greek and unknown characters, which may point to their origin. Swinton shares his findings with the Royal Society, hoping that they will contribute to the understanding of these historical artifacts.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
