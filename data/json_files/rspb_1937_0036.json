They found that certain carcinogenic hydrocarbons, such as 1:2:5:6-dibenzanthracene, significantly inhibited the growth of tumours, while non-carcinogenic hydrocarbons had no such effect. This research contributed to the understanding of how cancer-causing substances can influence tumour growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Oncology"}
