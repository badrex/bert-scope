The authors found that the rate of evaporation from these suspensions is affected by the presence of protective agents, such as rubber or cellulose nitrate, which prevent particle aggregation. The results show that suspensions with separate particles exhibit constant viscosity, while those with aggregates have a rapidly increasing viscosity at low rates of shear. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of non-aqueous suspensions and their potential applications in various industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
