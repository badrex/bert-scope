The research reveals that the axial skeleton is primitive, lacking expanded costal plates and accessory zygapophyses found in later cynodonts. The shoulder joint's mechanism indicates that the forelimb did not generate significant locomotory forces. The hindlimb was capable of both sprawling and erect gaits, with proficient aquatic locomotion also occurring. The study of Procynosuchus contributes to understanding the dual-gait mechanism's evolution in cynodonts, bridging the gap between primitive sprawling and obligatory erect gaits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
