Berthon to measure a ship's speed accurately, regardless of the water's depth, pitching, or rolling. It works by using two columns of water and air to balance the pressure on the mercury in the glass tube, ensuring the height of the column depends solely on the ship's velocity. The device also indicates the vessel's true course or leeway, making it a valuable tool for navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ship technology"}
