The structure of TBP, TBP bound to a consensus TATA element, and the ternary complex of transcription factor IIB (TFIIB) recognizing TBP bound to a TATA element are analyzed. TBP is found to induce a dramatic conformational change in the DNA, and its structure resembles a molecular \"saddle\" that sits astride the DNA.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
