They employed more complete trial wave functions than previous calculations, resulting in an approximate binding energy for the triton. The study also examined the dependence of binding energy on the nature of the exchange operator, the difference in binding energies of tritium and helium-3, and the magnetic moments of tritium and helium-3.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
