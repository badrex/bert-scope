They found that the minimum audible amplitude for a sensitive ear is 0.7 / qa, which refers to a telephone of usual construction with a diaphragm fundamental of about 580. This research helps improve our understanding of sound measurement and audibility.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
