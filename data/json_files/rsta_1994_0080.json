These materials can form thermodynamically stable thermotropic ordered phases with two-dimensional long-range order and short-range order along the chain direction. The article explores the influence of molecular structure, molecular mass, and side-chain length on the temperature stability and phase behavior of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
