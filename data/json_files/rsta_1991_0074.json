The detector focused on three-dimensional information, high granularity, precise vertex determination, and particle identification. During its first year of operation, DELPHI recorded 138,000 hadronic decays, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 6.3. The experiment provided valuable insights into particle physics and high energy physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
