The authors discuss the potential of cloned antigens as tools for analyzing the host-protective immune response and selecting candidate vaccine molecules. They also explore the use of recombinant DNA technology to produce individual proteins for a defined antigen vaccine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
