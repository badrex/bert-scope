These contractions accelerate the flow of blood in the veins, while the valves prevent the backward movement of blood. The study of these unique features in bat veins could provide insights into understanding blood circulation and potential applications in medicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
