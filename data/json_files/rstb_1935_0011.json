The author suggests that human selection may have played a role in creating situations where dominant traits are more common in poultry than in other species. The research explores the origins of the experiment and the factors responsible for crest, polydactyly, and barred plumage in particular.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
