The author investigates the influence of heat on the chemical force within a voltaic circuit and how it can cause variations in the electric current. The experiments demonstrate the impact of heat on the electrolyte and the potential differences between metals in different temperature conditions. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of electrochemical reactions and their applications."}
