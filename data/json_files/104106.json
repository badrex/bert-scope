He observes the fountain's regular increase and decrease in water flow and discusses the possible factors influencing these phenomena. Atwell's observations and conjectures provide insights into the behavior of springs and contribute to the understanding of natural phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology"}
