They found that specimens quenched from 600\u00b0C reordered rapidly below 160\u00b0C, while specimens quenched from 300\u00b0C had a slower reordering process. The different behavior after quenching from 600\u00b0C is attributed to a higher concentration of quenched-in vacancies. The results indicate that quenched-in vacancies and short-range order both contribute to the changes in properties of quenched \u03b1-brass.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Order-Disorder Phenomena"}
