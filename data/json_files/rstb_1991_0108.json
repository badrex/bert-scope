The authors develop and test multivariate models to understand the basis of diet selection for montane and savannah baboons. They find that food selection is positively related to protein and lipid content and negatively to fiber, phenolics, and alkaloids. The study highlights the adaptability of baboons in various habitats and their ability to extract nutrients from different food sources, making them successful in their environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
