They discovered new electronic transitions and term values in the gold atom, confirming the accuracy of Bohr's model of electronic orbits. The study also revealed the significance of inverse D triplets in the spectra of copper, silver, and gold.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
