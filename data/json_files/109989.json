The substance forms white acicular crystals and is analyzed by passing its vapor over red-hot oxide of copper. The authors conclude that the compound consists of one portion of chlorine and two of carbon, and it bears a resemblance to other chlorides of carbon in its physical and chemical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chlorine compounds"}
