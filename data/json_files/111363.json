He discovered two methods of reproduction, agamic and ephippial, and described the male organs and the development of the eggs. The ephippium provides protection to the ephippial eggs until they hatch. Lubbock also discussed the phenomenon of parthenogenesis in Daphnia and compared it to other cases in the Articulata group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
