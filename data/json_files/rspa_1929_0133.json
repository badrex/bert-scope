The authors analyze the conditions of continuity and energy to determine the chance of penetration, finding that it depends on whether the energy of the incident particle is equal to a characteristic energy of the nucleus. The study also highlights the resonance effect in the penetration process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
