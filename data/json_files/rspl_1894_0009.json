It corrects a mistake in the magnetic declination and inclination observations made at various locations. It also includes experimental investigations on the effective temperature of the sun and information about certain alloys. The corrected value for the magnetic declination is 23'30' instead of 20'30'.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
