They argue that a large proportion of genetic variability is neutral or nearly neutral at the protein or DNA level. While frequency-dependent selection exists, it is not a significant factor in maintaining genetic variability, except in special cases. The driving force of evolution is mutation rather than selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
