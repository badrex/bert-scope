The assumption of random mixing is used to relate the thermodynamic properties of the mixture to those of a reference substance, following the law of corresponding states. The theory can account for mixing effects in non-polar liquid solutions and is applicable to gases and liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
