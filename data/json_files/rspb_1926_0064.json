They find that the iron compound of hematoporphyrin behaves like hematin, requiring a nitrogenous substance for the formation of hemochromogen. The study also shows that carbon monoxide-hemochromogen resembles carbon monoxide-hemoglobin more when a nitrogen compound is present.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
