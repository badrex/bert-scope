The authors develop a spatial stochastic process to describe objects in the image, such as stars and spiral galaxies, and apply this theory to images of spiral galaxies. The goal is to improve schematic reconstructions and automate galaxy classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Galaxy Classification"}
