The author compares various titration methods, including formaldehyde, alcohol, and acetone, and concludes that the Van Slyke method is preferred for colored biological extracts, while the formaldehyde (phenolphthalein) titration is better for colorless ones. The study also investigates the effect of pK on the efficiency of decolourants like norite and lead acetate and finds that lead acetate at pH 6 is preferable. The article highlights the importance of understanding the zwitterion conception for interpreting titrimetric methods in biological samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
