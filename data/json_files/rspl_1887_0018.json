Thomson, discusses the formation of coreless vortices when a solid object moves through an inviscid incompressible fluid. He explains that if the fluid pressure is greater than a certain threshold, the fluid will remain in contact with the moving solid. However, if the pressure is reduced, the fluid is thrown off the solid, causing a disturbed motion. The author also explores the possibility of coreless vortices forming and being shed off behind the solid as it moves through the fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
