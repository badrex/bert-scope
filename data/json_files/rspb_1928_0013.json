They found that X-ray exposure caused degeneration of oocytes and follicles, leading to sterilization. The study also showed that the corpora lutea in sterilized ovaries became permanent structures but did not retain their oestrous-inhibiting power for long. This research provided insights into the effects of radiation on reproductive systems and the potential consequences of sterilization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
