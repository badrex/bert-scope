The authors present a two-layered model to analyze the propagation of gravity waves on sheared flows and discuss the behavior of particles in these waves. The findings can be applied to various barotropic flows, including atmospheric gravity waves and flows of compressible and incompressible fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
