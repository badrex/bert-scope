They use a combination of ensemble averaging and multiple-scattering techniques and find that for the Dirichlet case, the effective boundary condition becomes mixed, while for the Neumann problem, the normal derivative on the smooth surface equals a suitable combination of first- and second-order derivatives tangent to the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
