They found that the specific activity of the protein fraction increased for several hours as methionine was taken up from the amino-acid pool. There was a considerable variation in specific activities among different animals, possibly due to individual differences in diffusion and dose administration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
