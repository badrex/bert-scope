They analyzed the structure and connections of retinular cells, monopolar cells, and their synapses within the lamina cartridges. The dragonfly's unique ommatidium structure and synaptic configurations were examined, providing insights into the neural organization and visual information transfer in dragonflies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuroanatomy"}
