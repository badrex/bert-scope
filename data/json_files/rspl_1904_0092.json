The paper vibrates irregularly due to the irregularity of the blows from the tuning fork, resulting in a complex sound. This phenomenon can be observed when the paper is lightly touched by the vibrating fork and does not remain in contact throughout the vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
