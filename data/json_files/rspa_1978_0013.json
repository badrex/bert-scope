They distinguish between inequivalent and equivalent chromophores and calculate the differential scattering intensities for each case. The leading contribution to the differential intensity involves the interference of second- and fourth-order probability amplitudes, which depends on the group separation between chromophores.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
