They found that when sulphur is purified and protected from exposure to air, it gives reproducible viscosity values. The less common crystalline form of \"Mother of Pearl\" sulphur also separates easily from the purified sulphur and exhibits stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
