Males display two types of flight, one with rapid wing flapping and another with extended wings in a \"sailing-flight.\" During the latter, males expose their anal brushes, which are scent-producing organs. When a female approaches, the male and female engage in an aerial dance before mating. The author suggests that the scent organs play a crucial role in attracting females and that the rapid wing vibrations during flapping-flight may help release and distribute the scent.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
