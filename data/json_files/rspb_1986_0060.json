They found that Gabor functions, which are the product of a Gaussian envelope and a sinusoid, provide a good description of the receptive-field profiles to a first approximation. However, their analysis does not support the notion that simple cells generally fit into even- and odd-symmetric categories.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
