They found two distinct lineages and two clades within the western lineage, which correspond to different ancestral refugia. This study demonstrates the relevance of molecular phylogeography for identifying conservation units and managing endangered populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Conservation Genetics"}
