The committee recommends conducting studies on the brightness of stars, actinometric observations, and spectroscopic analysis of the solar spectrum, including the red protuberances and the corona. They also suggest purchasing telescopes and spectroscopes for these observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Eclipses and Atmospheric Research"}
