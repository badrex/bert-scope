The authors explain the various specializations of the exoskeleton that stiffen the thorax and provide the 'click' mechanism triggering take-off. They also discuss the importance of the link-plates in aligning hook and socket devices and describe the muscles involved in the flea's jump.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
