The resistivity of these metals is determined in the temperature range between 1.5 and 20 Kelvin, and the results are compared with theoretical predictions. The resistivity of sodium closely agrees with theory, while other alkali metals show deviations, suggesting that small impurities may cause anomalies in their resistivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
