The sheep was able to move and feed with the horn, which weighed 26 pounds. The horn was flexible and hollow, allowing the sheep to adjust it as needed. The sheep's unique horn was the result of a preternatural growth that replaced its normal horns. The stuffed skin of this sheep, along with its horn, is now in the museum of the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Anatomy"}
