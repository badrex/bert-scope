The suspension is prepared by mixing colloidal graphite with water and sodium hydroxide, followed by filtration and dilution with blood serum or acacia solution. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in frog's web perfusion experiments and discuss the limitations of using this technique in intact animals due to intravascular agglutination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
