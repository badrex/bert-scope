They determined the limit of observation set by thermal agitation on moving-coil galvanometers and galvanometer amplifiers. The study covered the Brownian motion of a galvanometer with an appreciable inductance in its circuit and a galvanometer amplifier containing two galvanometers with arbitrary conditions of damping. The results confirmed Ising's result and the theoretical investigations, showing that the theoretical limit can be consistently attained in practice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
