They found that light treatment caused cross-linking of the long-chain molecules, leading to increased resistance to stretching and insolubility. The crystalline structure of polychloroprene remained unchanged, with the unit cell possibly being orthorhombic and containing four chloroprene units.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
