They found that space irradiances beneath the leaf surface were 1.5-2.0 times greater than the incident light, indicating efficient light trapping. The study showed that light microenvironment, leaf anatomy, and photosynthesis are closely related in M. sativa leaves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
