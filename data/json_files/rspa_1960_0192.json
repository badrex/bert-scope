The authors found that the electrical resistance and thermoelectric power of graphite decrease when it forms crystal compounds with alkali metals. The results indicate a significant difference between the effects of electron donor and acceptor groups on the electrical properties of graphite.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
