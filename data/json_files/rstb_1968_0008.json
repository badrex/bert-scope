The results show a significant decrease of unbanded snails from pre-iron Age samples to present-day ones, suggesting that climate affects the frequencies of banding morphs, with unbanded and mid-banded snails being favored by better summers than those currently experienced in Britain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
