By transplanting tissues from animals of different ages into other animals, researchers can analyze the changes that occur in various systems as they age. The author presents four experimental situations that demonstrate the usefulness of this method, including ovarian grafts, skin grafts, and the study of immune responses in aging animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Aging research"}
