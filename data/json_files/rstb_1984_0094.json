They found that the mature P and a subunits contain 642 and 993 amino acids, respectively. The single-chain precursor protein, preproC3, has a molecular mass of 186,484 Da and consists of 1,663 amino acid residues. The study also revealed potential carbohydrate attachment sites and compared the murine C3 sequence with human C3 cDNA data.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Genetics"}
