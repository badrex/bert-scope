The model reveals that the introduction of perceptual error can lead to the evolution of discrete, \"all-or-nothing\" signals. This research provides a strategic explanation for the typical intensity observed in many animal displays and can be applied to various instances of quality advertisement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
