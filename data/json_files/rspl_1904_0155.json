The author finds a strong correlation between the two, suggesting that the absence of rainfall in the previous autumn has a significant impact on wheat yield. A linear equation is proposed to represent this relationship, and the results are compared to actual yields for 21 years, showing a high level of accuracy in the model.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Climate"}
