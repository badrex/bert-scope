The authors find that below a certain temperature, the position and shape of the Raman-active phonon can be explained by third- and fourth-order anharmonicity. At higher temperatures, additional scattering develops on the low-energy side of the phonon, which is accounted for by a theory of defect-induced scattering that considers both anion vacancies and interstitials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
