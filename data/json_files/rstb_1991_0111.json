It examines the relationship between primate feeding behavior and encephalization, and how different diets affect brain size and cognitive abilities. The study finds that fruit and animal diets can fuel larger primate brains, while folivorous diets with low energy and high toxicity may constrain available energy and basal metabolic rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
