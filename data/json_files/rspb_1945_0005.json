The researchers discovered two independent excitabilities with different chronaxies, which are essential for understanding the nerve cord's activity and response to stimuli. The findings contribute to the knowledge of earthworm physiology and neurophysiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
