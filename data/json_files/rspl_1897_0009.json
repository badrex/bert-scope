The authors found a significant change in the deposits at a depth of 115 feet, consisting of shingle and sand, which they believe were deposited under different conditions than the delta deposits. The determination of the geological age of these deposits is considered a problem of great importance and interest.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
