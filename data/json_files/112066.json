The author, Lionel S. Beale, describes a previously undiscovered plexus of nerve fibers in fungiform papillae and the connection between these fibers and the nervous tissue. He also discusses the relationship between nerve fibers and other tissues in the frog's body, as well as the process of muscle growth through the movement of nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
