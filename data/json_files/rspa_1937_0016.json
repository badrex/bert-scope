They found that the absorption coefficient is proportional to the pressure, and the continuous long-wavelength wing is interrupted by discrete bands. The results support the sixth power distance law of the polarization potential, and the discrete bands are attributed to transitions between quantized states of the mercury atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
