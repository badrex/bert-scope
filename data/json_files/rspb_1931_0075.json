They found evidence of parasynapsis, a pairing between homologous end-segments of chromosomes, and observed the behavior of chromosomes during meiosis. This research helps to understand the genetic structure and breeding behavior of Oenothera plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
