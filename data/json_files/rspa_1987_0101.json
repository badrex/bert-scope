The author discusses the relevance of low-order model systems and their limitations, as well as the importance of understanding the mechanisms behind the appearance of chaos in these systems. The study includes examples of convection in two-dimensional thermosolutal systems and the complications that arise when multiple spatial structures are involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
