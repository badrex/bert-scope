The author uses a stratigraphic division based on deep-sea sediments in the Atlantic to analyze the sequences of permafrost, loesses, fossil soils, slope sheets, fluviatile sediments, vegetation, glacial deposits, and landforms. The study reveals the impact of climate continentality on the evolution of permafrost, vegetation, and soils, as well as the history of glaciation in Europe.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Palaeogeography"}
