They found that while silica is not essential for plant growth, it can partially replace or enhance the effects of phosphoric acid in the soil. The addition of soluble silica to certain plots resulted in increased crop yields, suggesting a potential role for silica in cereal nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
