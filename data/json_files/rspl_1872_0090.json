They identify and analyze different color components in plants, such as chlorophyll and xanthophyll, and study their properties and interactions with light. This research contributes to the understanding of plant life and the role of pigments in photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
