Monocular deprivation causes LGN neurons in deprived laminae to be smaller in cross-sectional area than those in non-deprived laminae. However, reverse suture can counteract this effect, with the size difference between laminae being abolished within 6 days after reverse suture performed at the age of 1 month. This research shows that the morphological recovery in the LGN correlates with studies on the width of ocular dominance'stripes' in the visual cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Development"}
