The researchers found that both parasites cause chronic infections in orang-utans and can be transmitted through blood and mosquito bites. The study also discusses the evolution of primate malarias and their relationship to their hosts, as well as the potential risks of these parasites infecting humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
