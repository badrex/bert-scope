It presents a theoretical analysis of how pressure changes, both self-induced and externally applied, affect the reaction rate and explosion times in condensed explosives. The study aims to provide a general analytical basis for understanding the complex phenomenon of hot-spot reactions and their role in shock-wave initiation in solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
