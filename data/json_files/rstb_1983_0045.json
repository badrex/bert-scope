The author explains how phosphorylation of the initiation factor eIF-2 controls protein synthesis under various conditions, such as haemin concentration, double-stranded RNA, cellular stress, and thioredoxin system failure. The article also explores the molecular mechanisms behind the inhibition of protein synthesis and the involvement of the recycling factor (RF) in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular and Cellular Biology"}
