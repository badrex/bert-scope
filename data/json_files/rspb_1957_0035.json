They found that the velocity constant of dissociation is simply proportional to the number of combined ligand molecules. The results support the view that the kinetics of reactions of ligand molecules and haemoglobin molecules are subject to simple statistical principles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
