They designed an apparatus to measure viscosity in absolute terms and tested it on over 70 liquids. The results showed that molecular weight, isomerism, and substitution affected viscosity, and that some liquids containing molecular complexes did not follow the established rules. The authors also found that temperature played a significant role in viscosity, with water and alcohols having larger temperature coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
