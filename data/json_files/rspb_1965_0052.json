Mice from two different stocks were kept at -3\u00b0C and 21\u00b0C, and their food consumption, body weight, and reproductive success were compared. The results showed that mice from both stocks at -3\u00b0C had lower body weight, consumed more food relative to body weight, and had fewer offspring with higher mortality rates compared to mice at 21\u00b0C. The old-stock mice, with generations reared in the cold, had better reproductive success and food efficiency than the new-stock mice. The study suggests that cold adaptation may improve reproductive success and food utilization in mice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
