The authors demonstrate that using a mixture of ligands, such as EGTA, HEDTA, and NTA, ensures that the metal ion is highly buffered at any calibration point. This approach provides better precision and covers a wider calibration range compared to previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
