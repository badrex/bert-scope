They found that the paralysis following diphtheria is closely associated with the disease and is likely caused by a ferment produced by the Bacillus diphtherias, which digests the body's proteins into albumoses and an organic acid. These substances produce the symptoms of fever and paralysis due to nerve degeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
