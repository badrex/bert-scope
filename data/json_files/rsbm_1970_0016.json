Born in Vienna, she worked in Berlin with Otto Hahn, where they made significant contributions to the field of nuclear physics. Meitner faced challenges as a woman in a male-dominated field but continued to make important discoveries throughout her career. She later became the head of the physics department at the Kaiser-Wilhelm Institute for Chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
