The authors develop a thermomechanical theory of shells that accounts for electromagnetic and thermal effects, using a two-dimensional continuum model known as Cosserat surfaces. They discuss various applications of the theory, including piezoelectric plates and elastic wave guides.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromechanics"}
