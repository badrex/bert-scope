They used experimental results from Occhialini and Powell to check the predicted angular distribution of scattered particles and determine the mass of the meson. The total scattering cross-section predicted by the theory agreed with empirical results. This study is important for understanding the interaction between neutrons and protons and the nature of nuclear forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
