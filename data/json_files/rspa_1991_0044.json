{"article_id": "rspa_1991_0044", "revised_title": "Adjustments to SI Units and Fundamental Physical Constants", "semantic_tags": ["SI Units", "Fundamental Physical Constants", "Time and Frequency", "Voltage and Resistance Units", "Thermometry"], "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism", "tldr": "The article discusses recent changes in the values assigned to the national representations of the SI units of time, temperature, potential, and resistance, as well as the implications of recent work on fundamental physical constants. It also covers the improvements in measurement accuracy and the changes in the definitions of SI units, the realization of units, and the addition of new derived units and prefixes. The article highlights the importance of maintaining a standard representation of the unit with a much greater degree of constancy than before, using atomic or quantum properties. It also discusses the changes in the assigned absolute values of voltage, resistance, and other standards to achieve worldwide uniformity and remove differences between countries. Finally, the article mentions the improvements in the accuracy of fundamental physical constants and the need for further evaluations."}
