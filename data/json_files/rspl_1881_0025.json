The author discusses previous attempts and experiments in bone transplantation, and suggests that bone can grow after transplantation and potentially provide practical results. The study highlights the importance of understanding the elements of bone best suited for transplantation and the need for proper blood supply to ensure successful transplantation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Surgery"}
