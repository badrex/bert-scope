The unusual growth was examined by the Philosophical Society of Oxford, who found it to be thickest around the base of the heart and gradually thinner towards the apex. This growth was found to be compressing the heart and lungs, causing difficulty in the ox's movement and breathing. The discovery provided valuable insights into the anatomy of oxen and the potential for unusual growths in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
