They used a Dolezalek electrometer with a Weston cell to create a uniform scale value and improve insulation. The device was tested and found to be effective in measuring small differences in potential, making it useful for atmospheric measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric and Electromagnetic Physics"}
