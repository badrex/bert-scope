They explain the point-to-point projection of the retina onto the cortex and how the macula region occupies a larger portion of the striate area compared to peripheral regions. The study provides evidence for a precise projection of the retina on the visual cortex, which is essential for understanding vision and its disorders.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroanatomy and Neurophysiology"}
