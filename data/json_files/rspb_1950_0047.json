They discover that the nuclear membrane consists of two layers, an outer porous layer and an inner layer, and provide insights into their composition and arrangement. This study contributes to the understanding of the nuclear membrane's structure and properties in various cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
