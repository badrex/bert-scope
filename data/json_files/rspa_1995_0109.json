It explores the effects of electronic Zeeman energy, magnetic hyperfine interaction, and nuclear Zeeman interaction on the nuclear levels. The author also suggests alternative experimental methods, such as hole-burning experiments, nuclear orientation, and dynamic nuclear polarization, to study europium vanadate's nuclear interactions and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
