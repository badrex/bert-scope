They discovered a complex system of canals and foramina that connect the tympanic cavity to the palate, which is more intricate than previously thought. This study provides insights into the hearing and sound conduction mechanisms in these reptiles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Osteology"}
