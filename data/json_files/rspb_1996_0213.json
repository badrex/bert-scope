First-time mothers always produce single offspring, while multiparous females produce both singletons and twins. As maternal rank increases, females tend to produce a sequence of offspring types: F, FF > M > MF > MM. This differs from Williams' prediction, as FF are produced by females of lower rank than M. The study suggests that dominant females have much to gain from producing exceptionally good males, as single males are born heavier than other types of calves, and investment in males increases with maternal rank.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
