They conducted uniaxial stress experiments to determine the band's properties and found that it is a transition between ground and excited electromechanical states of a trigonal center, coupled to vibrational modes. The results support the nitrogen-vacancy model for the center's structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
