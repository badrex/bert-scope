The results showed that isolated snails had reduced reproductive output compared to paired snails, suggesting that an absence of social facilitation, rather than inbreeding depression, may play a role in reducing reproductive output of isolated snails.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
