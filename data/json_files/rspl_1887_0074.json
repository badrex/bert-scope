They found that the virus resides in the cerebrospinal substance and peripheral nerves, not just in the salivary glands. The authors also investigated the effectiveness of Pasteur's treatment for rabies and found that it can confer immunity in rabbits but is difficult to determine its effect in dogs due to their extreme refractoriness to infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Infectious Diseases"}
