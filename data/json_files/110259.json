They attempted to analyze the influence of the moon on barometer fluctuations by classifying observations based on the moon's age and comparing results with those from the Paris Observatory. The author also investigated the effect of wind direction on barometer readings and found that it had a greater impact than other factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
