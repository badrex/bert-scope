They investigated the conditions under which different spectra can be best experimentally isolated. They discovered new spectra, including the low-pressure CO band spectrum and the comet-tail bands, and analyzed their wave-lengths and intensities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
