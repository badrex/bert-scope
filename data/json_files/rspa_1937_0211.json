They found that the reaction kinetics were influenced by factors such as molecular orientation, intermolecular spacing, and the presence of reaction products. The results showed that the velocity of reaction could be significantly altered by changing the surface pressure and the nature of the film. This research provides insights into the interfacial reactions and the factors affecting their rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
