They found that the parotid secretion of some \"harmless\" Colubrines is poisonous when injected subcutaneously, suggesting a gradual evolution of venom in snakes. This study contributes to understanding the venom apparatus of venomous snakes and its evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
