They focus on the first sharp diffraction peak, which is a signature of directional bonding and intermediate-range order. The study reveals differences in the structures of molten and glassy systems, with the former having a more pronounced first sharp diffraction peak, indicating a higher degree of covalent character and directional bonding.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
