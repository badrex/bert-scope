The research shows that the medial neurosecretory cells of the brain are responsible for retaining the blood in the mid-gut until the oocytes are nearing maturity. The findings suggest that EDNH plays a crucial role in this process, and further research is being conducted to understand its direct or indirect actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
