The authors explain how the heating caused by friction can lead to the softening and smoothing of metal surfaces, which then form an amorphous layer. They also explore the importance of oxide films in preventing welding between metal surfaces and the impact of high temperatures on these films.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
