They conduct experiments to analyze the composition of the air and its absorption process. The findings suggest that the oxygen in the air is absorbed more than the nitrogen, and carbon dioxide is produced in the lungs, which accumulates in the pleura. This research contributes to understanding the respiratory system and medical conditions related to air accumulation in the chest.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Respiratory System"}
