The author explores various electrochemical mechanisms, such as topotactic insertion reactions, Faradaic deposition, and reconstitution reactions, and evaluates their critical parameters. The focus is on materials that can act as solid solution electrodes, which can store energy in three-dimensional structures, leading to higher energy storage per unit volume. The article also highlights the importance of considering energy quality, which is the voltage at which energy is available, in addition to the total amount of energy stored.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy Storage and Conversion"}
