The authors use a theoretical formula to determine the mean free path and compare their results with experimental data from semi-conductors and photo-conductive materials. The study provides insights into the behavior of electrons in polar crystals and their interaction with lattice vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystal Physics"}
