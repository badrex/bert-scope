They discovered that dicentric chromatids form during meiosis due to crossing-over between inverted segments of chromosomes. The stretching of these chromatids during anaphase provides insight into the forces governing chromosome movement. The author also observes the separation of sister arms at the centromere and the uncoiling of chromosome threads by the expansion of the spindle, which helps in understanding the mechanics of chromosome division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
