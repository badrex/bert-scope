He explains how the new water source rose above the old one and had similar properties to nearby natural springs. Darwin also discusses the geological processes behind the formation of mountains and the potential for creating artificial springs in various locations for practical purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
