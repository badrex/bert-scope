They compare the motion of a point-charge to a sound-pulse in a medium with varying velocity. The authors also derive a differential equation for the wave-function of a point-charge, similar to Dirac's equation, but containing only vector and scalar quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
