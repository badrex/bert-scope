They find that the elliptical shape of valves is a variable property of ontogeny, and the 'ellipticus' species group is not monophyletic. This study contributes to a revision of the entire Tetracyclus genus and its implications for understanding stratigraphic and biogeographical distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobiology"}
