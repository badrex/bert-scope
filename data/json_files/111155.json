Snow Harris, examines the principles of magnetic induction experimentally and discovers that a limit exists for induced magnetic force, which varies depending on the magnetic conditions of the experiment. He also finds that magnetic induction depends on the surface of the magnetic substance and that the laws of force can be as the power of the distance inversely. The author concludes that magnetic attraction and repulsion can be explained by the changes in the law of induction and that the conditions of electrical and magnetic force are the same.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
