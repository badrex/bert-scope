Contrary to the general belief, he found that the barometer often rises with strong winds and that there is a steady connection between the winds and the barometer movements in the region. The valley of the St. Lawrence, surrounded by hills, plays a significant role in this connection.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
