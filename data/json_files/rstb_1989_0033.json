It highlights the importance of antigen processing, major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules, and intrinsic factors in determining immunodominance. The authors also explore the role of amphipathic helices in immunodominant sites and their potential use in predicting antigenic sites for vaccine development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
