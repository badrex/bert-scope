Two proposed systems are presented, both involving an anaerobic recycling stage where fermented wastes are converted to biomass by bacterial photosynthesis. The author also highlights the energetic aspects of algal recycling and the viability of an anaerobic cycle driven by photosynthetic bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Biotechnology"}
