It emphasizes the roles of neutron and X-ray diffraction combined with isotopic substitution to study the structure of multi-component liquids, particularly aqueous solutions. The authors present experimental results and explain the significance of the findings in understanding the structure of concentrated electrolyte solutions and the existence of a lattice-like structure in some systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
