The author explores the catabolic pathways and enzyme systems used by these fungi to break down lignin into various products. The article also highlights the challenges in processing lignin for useful chemicals and the need for further research to improve the efficiency of lignin biodegradation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
