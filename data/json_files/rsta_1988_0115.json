The authors describe various organometallic reactions and their applications in synthesizing complex organic structures, focusing on the stereoselectivity and predictability of these reactions. Examples include the Pauson-Khand reaction, dicobaltoctacarbonyl-mediated cyclization, and the synthesis of vincristine model compounds. Organometallic chemistry offers new insights into controlling selectivity and stereochemistry in organic synthesis, leading to more efficient syntheses of natural products and their variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
