The peak season of emergence coincides with the most intense part of the southeast trade winds season. The estimated number of nesting turtles is around 1000 per year, which is lower than previous estimates from the early 20th century. The nesting activity is largely restricted to fewer than 60 short beaches along the atoll's perimeter. The presence of humans and buildings near the Settlement beach may be inhibiting turtle emergence in the vicinity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
