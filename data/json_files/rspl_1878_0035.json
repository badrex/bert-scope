He argues that the method is flawed and that smaller impulses at short intervals can potentially increase the radius of the \"wobble\" instead of reducing it, which is contrary to Haughton's assumption. The author concludes that Haughton's estimate of time is not reliable for determining the history of the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
