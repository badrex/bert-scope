They explain how imperfections, such as dislocations, play a crucial role in crystal growth, making two-dimensional nucleation unnecessary. The study also discusses the temperature dependence of the surface structure of a perfect crystal and the role of adsorbed molecules in the growth process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
