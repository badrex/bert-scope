They observed remarkable changes in the absorption spectrum and color of the vapour, which they attributed to the formation of intermediate molecular structures between diatomic and octatomic sulphur molecules. The findings suggest that triatomic sulphur molecules, similar to ozone, may exist and contribute to the observed changes in the spectrum and color of the vapour.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular chemistry"}
