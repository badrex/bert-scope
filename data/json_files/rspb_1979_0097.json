They found that the l-enantiomers were completely inactive as aggregators or inhibitors of platelet function, while the d-enantiomers showed high potency. This suggests that the l-enantiomers could be ideal controls for differentiating between specific and non-specific labelling of receptors on platelets.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Molecular Biology"}
