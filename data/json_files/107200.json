The method involves setting down a number under itself removed one or more places to the right and subtracting, repeating this operation until a logarithm is obtained. The method is suitable for both large and small numbers and can be performed accurately to 10 decimal places with about 27 subtractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
