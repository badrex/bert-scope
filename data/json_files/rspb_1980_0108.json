They found that the drug has a considerable dipole moment and that the electrostatic fields can be separated into two large regions. These findings stress the importance of electrostatic forces in biological recognition phenomena and reveal a striking complementarity between the fields produced by the antibiotic and its receptor binding site.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Biology"}
