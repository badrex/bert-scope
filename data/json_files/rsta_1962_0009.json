It develops a physical theory to interpret these spectra and discusses the unique features of molecules with spin-degeneracy, such as Kramers degenerate molecules and tetrahedral and octahedral molecules in fourfold degenerate states. The article provides group-theoretical selection rules for infra-red and Raman spectra and considers the impact of vibronic coupling on these molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum chemistry"}
