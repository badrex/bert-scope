The research also discovers a lower pressure limit below which the reaction rate is negligible but above which explosion occurs. The findings suggest that the presence of an inert gas, like nitrogen, may have a deactivating influence on the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
