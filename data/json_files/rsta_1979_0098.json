The technique allows for the analysis of molecular mass, size, and intermolecular interactions, as well as the characterization of internal motion. The study focuses on the recently discovered plasmid DNA molecules, which are monodisperse, have a continuous molecular mass range, and can be obtained in various forms, such as supercoiled, relaxed circular, and open linear conformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Biophysics"}
