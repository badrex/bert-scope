Challenger in the Deep Oceans", "semantic_tags": ["Seismic refraction", "Oceanography", "Geology", "Volcanic rocks", "Deep ocean structure"], "tldr": "The authors conducted seismic refraction experiments during the world cruise of H.M.S. Challenger to study the structure of the deep ocean floor. They discovered a simple structure consisting of a high-velocity rock layer covered by about half a kilometer of sediment, which is typical of flat deep ocean areas outside continental fringes. Near volcanic islands, an additional layer of volcanic material with a velocity of 4 to 5 km/s was found. The authors suggest that all islands and seamounts in the deep Pacific have grown out of the flat seafloor as volcanoes and have subsequently sunk due to the weight of the replaced rock.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
