His research focused on the luminescent properties of phosphors and the exploitation of these properties in displays for airborne radar. Gibson's work, conducted in collaboration with George Garlic, led to a better understanding of the factors governing luminescent efficiency and the role of non-radiative transitions in phosphors. This research laid the foundation for further advancements in solid state physics and its applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
