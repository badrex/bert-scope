It reviews the occurrence, effects, causative factors, and possible mechanisms of skeletal deformities in fish and suggests that these deformities could be a useful biological variable for monitoring marine pollution due to their irreversible nature and ease of detection.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
