They examine the formation of the outer and inner layers of cells and their roles in embryonic development. The author agrees with Lieberkuhn's account of the development of the embryonic layers in the mole, which differs from Van Beneden's and Kolliker's views. The study provides insights into the complex process of mammalian development and the formation of germinal layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
