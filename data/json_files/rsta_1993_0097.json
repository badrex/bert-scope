LCPs can have main chain, side chain, or combined structures and can exhibit prolate or oblate nematic order. The article explores the mechanisms of lyotropic and thermotropic ordering in LCPs and the transition to the ordered state. It also reviews the self-assembly process in transesterifying LCPs and the potential applications of LCPs in optoelectronics, elastomers, and other areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
