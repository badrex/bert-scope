The study shows that primordial germ cells align themselves with the shapes of the substrate cells or their stress fiber cytoskeleton, suggesting a link between orientation of the substrate cells and primordial germ cell guidance. The glycoprotein fibronectin is found to be involved in primordial germ cell adhesion, further indicating a connection between substrate orientation and cell guidance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
