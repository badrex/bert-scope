The observations were challenging due to limited time and unfavorable conditions. The results showed that only a few stars exhibited measurable parallax, and the author recommended two stars, 32 Eridani and Herschel 95, for further observation by other astronomers.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
