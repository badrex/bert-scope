The results showed that the chemical brightness at the center of the Sun's disc was three to five times greater than at the edge, and that the south polar regions had a higher chemical brightness than the north polar regions. This study aimed to contribute to a better understanding of the Sun's chemical and physical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
