They found that the number of hydroxyl radicals and molecular products varied as linear energy transfer increased. The study provides insights into the radiation chemistry of aqueous solutions and the reactions occurring along particle tracks.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiation Chemistry"}
