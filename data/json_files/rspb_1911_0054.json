They found that under controlled conditions, it was impossible to distinguish different wavelengths within a monochromatic region, suggesting that the appearance of a monochromatic region is a fundamental physiological fact. The author also discussed the importance of irregularly dispersed light and contrast in color perception, which had been overlooked by other physicists.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology of Vision"}
