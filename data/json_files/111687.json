The calorimeter allowed for accurate measurements of heat radiation from a given area, improving upon previous methods that only measured from a thermometer bulb. The paper includes a detailed description of the instrument and experimental results for different substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Heat Transfer"}
