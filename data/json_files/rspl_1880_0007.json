Unwin on the friction of water against solid surfaces of different degrees of roughness. The experiments involved rotating disks in water with varying surface roughness and chamber sizes. The results showed that the resistance of the disks varied with the disk's diameter, surface roughness, and chamber size. The friction also increased with the size of the chamber and decreased with an increase in water temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
