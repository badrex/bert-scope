The study focuses on the mathematical techniques and physical interpretations of the results, which are applicable to a more realistic model. The findings show that the incident wave's spatial confinement plays a crucial role in the wave's behavior and excitation of the waveguide.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
