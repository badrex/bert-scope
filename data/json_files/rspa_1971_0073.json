The study focuses on configurations where only specific electrons are not in closed shells. The results are consistent with experimental data for the shell, and the analysis considers the excitation of electrons in different scenarios. The article also discusses the core polarization effect and the use of effective operators to reproduce configuration interaction effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
