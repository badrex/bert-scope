The study shows that these currents are due to the production of a state of circular magnetisation as a result of torsional stress and longitudinal magnetism acting jointly. The findings contribute to the understanding of the effects of stress on magnetic susceptibility and residual magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
