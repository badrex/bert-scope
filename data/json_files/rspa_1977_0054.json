They used the Kossel microdiffraction technique to determine the orientation of martensite crystals and found that twinning occurs mainly on {112} planes. The presence of transformation twins and slip bands influences the predominance of deformation modes in these crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
