These deep-sea creatures were found in extreme depths, with some species being abundant even at 2000 fathoms. The author also describes the physical characteristics and classifications of these echinoderms, as well as their relation to extinct species from the Cretaceous and Tertiary periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
