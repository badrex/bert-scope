The authors describe various experiments to detect parity non-conservation in strong interactions, such as radiative capture, circular polarization of gamma rays, and angular distribution of radiations. The results suggest that the relative strength of the parity non-conserving interaction is very likely less than 10^-7.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
