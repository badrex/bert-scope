It explains how disturbances in the pericellular environment can lead to changes in basement membrane structure and function. The authors illustrate this by referring to diseases affecting the basement membranes in the glomeruli of the kidney and alveoli of the lung.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
