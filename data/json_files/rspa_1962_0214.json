They discovered that spherulites consist of crystalline and amorphous regions, with crystalline regions growing to a preferred thickness of a few hundred Angstroms and molecular chains oriented perpendicular to the film. The authors proposed a growth mechanism for spherulites in thin films, which is different from the three-dimensional crystallization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
