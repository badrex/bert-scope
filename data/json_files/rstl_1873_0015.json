Pengelly, explored the Brixham Cave in Devonshire, discovering a variety of mammalian fossil remains. The findings shed light on the distribution of extinct species like the Rhinoceros and the Elephant, and provide valuable information on the geological period in which they coexisted. The exploration of the Brixham Cave contributes to a better understanding of the transition between the Pliocene and Postpliocene faunas.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
