They compare X-ray bond length measurements with theoretical calculations using molecular orbital and valence bond theories. The author finds that the agreement between the two methods is encouraging, and that bond lengths vary in different parts of the molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
