They tested various materials and found that some alloys, like cast cobalt-chromium, offer better erosion resistance than others. The study also showed that the rate of erosion depends on factors like impact velocity, angle of incidence, and drop size.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
