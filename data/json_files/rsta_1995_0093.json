The authors review the possibilities of using these circuits to investigate phenomena such as spiral wave initiation, Turing pattern formation, and the dynamics of coupled layers supporting Turing and Hopf modes. The study of these patterns and chaos in cellular neural networks can have applications in neurophysiology and cardiophysiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
