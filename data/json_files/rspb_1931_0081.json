This method is applied to frog's gastrocnemius, allowing for more accurate measurements and overcoming previous limitations in myothermic experiments. The new method provides insights into muscle physiology and the relationship between tension and heat production during muscle activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
