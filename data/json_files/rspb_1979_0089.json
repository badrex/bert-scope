They filtered the cells through a column of Sephadex G-10 or G-15, separating smaller cells like zona reticularis and zona glomerulosa from larger zona fasciculata cells. This method maintained high enrichment and acceptable cell recovery levels while yielding viable cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
