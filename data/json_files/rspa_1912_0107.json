The authors found that the melting point of pure cuprous oxide is around 1210\u00b0C, and mixtures with compositions between 20% and 95% cuprous oxide separate into two layers at temperatures above 1195\u00b0C. The study also determined the dissociation pressures of the system and provided insights into the phase behavior of the copper-cuprous oxide system."}
