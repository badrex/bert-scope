The researchers found three distinct categories of oligodendrocytes based on their morphology, and they observed differences in their coupling patterns. These findings suggest that the different categories of oligodendrocytes may represent different stages in a developmental series, with implications for their roles in the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
