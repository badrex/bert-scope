The study reveals that monkeys with damaged visual cortex have local impairments in visual detection, and their ability to detect stimuli improves over time. This research provides insight into the functions of the visual cortex in animals and the development of visual perception.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
