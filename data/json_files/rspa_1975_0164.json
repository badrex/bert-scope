The authors provide solutions for the cooling process near the orifice and downstream, considering the effects of the Prandtl number. The research has practical applications in industries such as glass and polymer production, as well as in the electrical industry for thin metallic wires.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer and Fluid Dynamics"}
