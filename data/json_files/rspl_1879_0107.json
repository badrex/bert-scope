By reducing the resistance on the rotating helix and increasing the resistance on the magnets, the new machine provides a steadier light with greater average economy of power. This design also simplifies the regulator for electric lamps, making it more reliable and efficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
