The author derives formulae to predict speeds of propagation, electron and filament densities, and compares the theory with experimental results, showing reasonable agreement. The theory is then extended to impulse corona and subsequent stages of breakdown.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrical and Magnetic Fields"}
