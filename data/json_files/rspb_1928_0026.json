The author develops a method to evaluate rainfall and its impact on plant growth, focusing on the relationship between rainfall and crop yields in the tropics. The study finds that effective rainfall, a measure of the fraction of rainfall available for plant growth, is a significant factor in determining agricultural success in the tropics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Climate"}
