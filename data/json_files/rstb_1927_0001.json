They focus on the thymus gland and its connection to the lymphatic system, as well as the unique features of the fish's anatomy that affect the gland's structure and function. The study provides insights into the primitive condition of the thymus gland in bony fishes and its relation to higher vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Anatomy and Physiology"}
