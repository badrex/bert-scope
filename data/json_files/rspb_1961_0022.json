They discovered that mitosis is arrested in the absence of oxygen or in the presence of cyanide. This finding challenges previous generalizations that mitosis can proceed without oxygen once it has begun. The results suggest that all stages of cell division depend on the presence of oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
