In one case, sea salt was applied to the wound and a dressing of salt and burdock root was used. In the other case, fine sea salt was applied directly to the wound, and the patient also took a mixture of saffron, water, and white ash bark. Both patients recovered without further complications. This suggests that salt may be an effective treatment for rattlesnake bites.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > First Aid"}
