The research found that radio-sensitivity increases as oocytes progress through maturation stages, with the highest sensitivity at the first metaphase stage. The study also observed that oocytes in medium-sized follicles are more radio-resistant than pre-ovulatory oocytes. X-irradiation can lead to superovulation and a decrease in the size of corpora lutea of pregnancy. The degree of superovulation depends on the dose of X-rays and the developmental stage of the oocytes at the time of irradiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
