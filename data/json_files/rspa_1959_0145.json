They used the Kohn variational method and evaluated phases on DEUCE. The results showed that polarization effects were negligible in this approximation. This research contributes to understanding nuclear forces and low-energy neutron-deuteron scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
