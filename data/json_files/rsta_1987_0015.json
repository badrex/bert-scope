It highlights the importance of understanding processes associated with continental growth and the role of subduction and collision-related phenomena in shaping the Earth's crust. The author emphasizes the need for integrating petrology and geophysics to develop better models of dynamics and thermal history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Continental Tectonics"}
