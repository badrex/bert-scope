They propose that the probability of a cell being affected by X-rays is related to the ionization process, which could be due to the X-rays themselves or other factors. The author also suggests that the concept of a \"lethal dose\" may not be applicable in this context, as there is always a probability of some cells surviving even after a high dose.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
