It focuses on short complexes, which involve only two reactant and two product molecules, and applies the theory to mass-action systems with restricted elementary reactions. The study relates the quasi-thermodynamic behavior of these systems to the properties of their complex graphs, providing insights into the dynamic behavior of chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
