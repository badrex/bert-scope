The research finds that liquid viscosity has no effect on the initial growth of sinuous waves and that the region of instability extends over a greater range of wave frequencies than the inviscid theory predicts. The findings challenge previous theories and provide a more accurate understanding of wave growth in thin liquid sheets.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
