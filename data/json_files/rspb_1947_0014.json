They found that heat-denaturation causes changes in buffering capacity and the number of hydrogen ions absorbed or released, which varies with the initial pH of the juice. The results suggest that heat-denaturation may cause a change in protein structure involving imidazole, sulphydryl, and hydroxyl groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
