It derives first-order perturbations of a low-eccentricity satellite orbit due to the general harmonic coefficient of the Earth's gravitational field and provides compact expressions for the perturbations in cylindrical polar coordinates. The theory also discusses the definition of mean orbital elements and their role in the main problem of satellite orbit analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
