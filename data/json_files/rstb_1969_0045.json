It examines the role of specialized ependymal cells, known as tanycytes, which have long processes extending to the primary capillary networks of the pituitary portal vessels. These cells may play a role in regulating pituitary function and form a link between the cerebrospinal fluid and the blood system in the region of the pituitary, contributing to a neuroendocrine control system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroendocrinology"}
