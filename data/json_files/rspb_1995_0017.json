They develop a novel approach for identifying an intermediate scale at which the system's dynamics are essentially deterministic, low-dimensional, and chaotic, allowing for effective data compression and synthesis of ecological information.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
