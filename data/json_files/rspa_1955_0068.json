They found that the spectroscopic splitting factor for iron is approximately 2, and for nickel, it is around 2. In nickel-iron alloys, there is an anomaly near 40% nickel, where the -factor falls to 1. The measured line width is dependent on the composition of the alloys and is a minimum where the anisotropy constant passes through zero for iron-nickel alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
