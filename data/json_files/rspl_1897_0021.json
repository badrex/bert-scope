They discovered that the temperature of a star determines its spectral characteristics, and the presence of certain elements can be identified through their unique spectral lines. This research helps in understanding the evolution and behavior of stars, as well as the conditions in their atmospheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
