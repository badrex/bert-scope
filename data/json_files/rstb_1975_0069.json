The author also explores the potential economy of design in the immune system and the challenges posed by the large number of antibody specificities. The study of antibody structure and function has important implications for understanding the immune response and developing treatments for various diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
