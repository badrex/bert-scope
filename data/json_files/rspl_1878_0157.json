They discovered that certain lines, such as those from barium, strontium, calcium, potassium, and sodium, were reversed in the more refrangible part of the spectrum. The authors also discussed the possibility that these lines might belong to the same substance and provided analogies between the ratios of wave-lengths in different metals. This research contributes to the understanding of the chromosphere and its relationship to the sun's atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Spectroscopy"}
