{"article_id": "107256", "revised_title": "The Generation and Formation of Roots in Trees and Herbaceous Plants", "semantic_tags": ["Plant Biology", "Root Development", "Plant Anatomy", "Plant Propagation", "Sap Flow"], "tldr": "The author explains that roots in trees and herbaceous plants are generated by the cortical vessels that pass through the seed and leaves, rather than from the alburnum. The roots grow by adding new parts to their apex, while the elongation of previously organized parts is responsible for the growth of the stem and branches. The author also discusses the differences in root formation between trees and herbaceous plants, as well as the role of sap in generating roots and buds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
