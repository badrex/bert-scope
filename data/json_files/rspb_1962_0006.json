They found that the enzyme's stability increases with more prolonged exposure to D-arabinose and that the secondary lag in D-arabinose after growth in glucose is connected to the stability of the adaptive enzyme in glucose. The results provide insights into the complex history of adaptive changes in bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
