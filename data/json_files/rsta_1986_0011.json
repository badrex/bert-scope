It highlights the importance of breeding for better adaptation to irrigated conditions, considering factors such as yield potential, pest and disease resistance, and environmental adaptation. The article also emphasizes the need for selecting varieties that are responsive and high-yielding under irrigated conditions, as well as the importance of efficient water use and its impact on crop growth and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Agronomy"}
