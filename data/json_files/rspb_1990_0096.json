The research compares different viewing distances, angular separations, and real separations in a visual reaction task, finding that the 'attention' system operates at a point later than the computation of true physical location, rather than at the very early stage where angular separation only is available.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
