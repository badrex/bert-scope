The model suggests that geography has a negligible role, and higher atmospheric carbon dioxide levels (4 times present) resulted in a 5.5\u00b0C globally averaged surface temperature increase, which could explain the warmth of the Cretaceous era.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
