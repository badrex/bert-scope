They discovered that the worm feeds by pumping out the contents of the hydroid's gastral cavity, using its pharynx and proventriculus as a quick-acting pump. This feeding method allows the worm to obtain a constant supply of food without harming the hydroid, which grows vigorously despite the worm's presence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
