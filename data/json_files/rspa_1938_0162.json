They used advanced spectroscopic techniques to measure the nuclear spin and the interactions between the electrons and the nucleus. Their findings provide a better understanding of the atomic structure of iodine and its implications for nuclear electrical quadrupole moments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
