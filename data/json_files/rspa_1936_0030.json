They analyzed the vibrational constants and energy of dissociation of the lead oxide molecule, providing insights into its molecular states and potential dissociation products. Their findings contribute to the understanding of lead oxide's properties and its role in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
