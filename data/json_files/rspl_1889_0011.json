N. Hartley, describes a method of using vaporized metal films to test and analyze chemical samples. This method is particularly useful in detecting and estimating precious metals in other metals, as well as identifying impurities. The author also discusses the differences in color and volatility of various metal deposits, which can be used as a basis for identification.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
