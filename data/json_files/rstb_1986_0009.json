The HLA system, the major histocompatibility system in humans, plays a significant role in controlling immune interactions and includes genes for cell surface products, complement components, and 21-hydroxylase. The article explores the organization, function, and polymorphism of the HLA system and its evolution, providing insights into the broader concept of gene clusters and their evolution in higher eukaryotes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
