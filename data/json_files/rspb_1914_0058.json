They found that the development of the trypanosome is restricted to the labial cavity and hypopharynx of the fly, and it takes an average of 19 days for the fly to become infective. The study also revealed that the final stage of development occurs in the hypopharynx, where the trypanosomes revert to the original \"blood form\" and become infectious.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
