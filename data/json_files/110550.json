He found that these instincts can change over generations, as seen in woodcocks' fear of humans. Knight also noticed that hybrid offspring may have a stronger influence from the male parent. This study suggests that hereditary instincts can be influenced by education and breeding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
