The authors demonstrate that the fractal dimension of these surfaces can be used to predict the amount of mixing between two reactants in a turbulent flow, and they provide experimental evidence to support their predictions. The findings have implications for understanding and modeling mixing and entrainment in a variety of turbulent flows."}
