They focused on the skin and muscular fields of cranial and cervico-brachial nerves, providing insights into the sensory and motor distributions. The study also explored spinal reflexes and their relationship to the spinal cord's overall function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
