The research covers various aspects of the monstrosities, including the cranial, visceral, and vertebral skeletons, as well as the development of organs and systems. The findings contribute to the understanding of developmental biology and embryology, particularly in fish species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
