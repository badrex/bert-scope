The results showed that the entire process of oogenesis can occur in vitro under appropriate conditions, providing new insights into the factors responsible for the growth and development of the ovary and the inherent capacity of germ cells for independent growth and differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
