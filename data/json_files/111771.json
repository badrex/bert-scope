They share similar respiratory organs and other structural features, but have different shell types. The author proposes placing these Gasteropoda in a distinct order due to the differences in their respiratory organs compared to Pectinibranchiata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Malacology"}
