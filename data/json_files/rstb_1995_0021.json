The authors use a bidomain model to examine the role of close-contact varicosities (ccvs) and loose-contact varicosities (LCVS) in generating the fast and slow components of the synaptic potential. The results suggest that LCVS play a significant role in the central nervous system and that the declining phase of the potential is due to passive discharge of the membrane capacitance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
