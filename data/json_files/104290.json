He describes the unique geological features of the area, including the presence of stalactites and the encrustation of plants and trees. The author suggests that petrefaction is caused by mineral-rich water and steam, which fill the gaps left by decaying vegetation, leading to the formation of stone. This study provides valuable insights into the process of fossilization and the formation of limestone and marble.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
