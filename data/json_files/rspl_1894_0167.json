The research found that factors like temperature, light, and water salinity significantly affect the size and development of the larvae, with some factors causing growth inhibition or stimulation. The findings contribute to the understanding of how environmental conditions can influence the development of echinoderm larvae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
