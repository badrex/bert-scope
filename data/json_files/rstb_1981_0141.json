A generative grammar should be accompanied by a specification of processes by which ideas can be encoded in words and decoded by the hearer. The author provides examples of effective procedures implemented as computer programs for specific linguistic tasks, such as numeral systems in natural languages.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
