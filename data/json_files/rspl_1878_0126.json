They determined the constant of Jellett's polarimeter and found the specific rotation of lactin to be 59.17. The authors also examined the change in rotatory power over time and the effect of temperature and salts on lactin solutions. They discovered a break in the change of rotatory power, which may be related to lactin's dual nature, producing lactose and galactose.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis and Physical Chemistry"}
