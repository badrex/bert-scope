The authors study the signaling pathways initiated by growth factors in fibroblastic cells and find that thrombin and serotonin activate inositol lipid breakdown, while other mitogens like EGF, FGF, and PDGF do not. The study also shows that these mitogens recognize receptor-tyrosine kinases, suggesting a possible cross-communication between the inositol-lipid pathway and receptor-tyrosine kinases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
