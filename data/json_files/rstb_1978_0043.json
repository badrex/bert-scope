They found that the transcription unit is approximately 30,000 base pairs long and contains a coding segment of at least 6,000 base pairs, likely corresponding to salivary polypeptides. The 75 RNA is a messenger RNA molecule, and the large polysomes containing it suggest that the coding segment in 75 RNA is long. This research provides insights into the organization and function of eukaryotic chromosomes and chromatin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
