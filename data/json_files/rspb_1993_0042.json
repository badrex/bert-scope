They develop a model to disentangle the effects of these two factors on elephant population dynamics since 1814, concluding that carrying capacity reductions were a major cause of population declines in the 19th and early 20th centuries, while hunting for ivory has been the cause of an increasingly rapid population decline since 1950.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
