It focuses on the rapid colonization and multiplication of bacteria, protozoa, and large deposit-feeding animals on phytodetritus, which is a deposit formed by the seasonal settlement of marine snow. The intermittent nature of these organic inputs influences the population dynamics and reproductive cycles of certain responding species, often opportunistic organisms that can utilize ephemeral food resources. The patchy distribution of organic material on the ocean floor plays a significant role in structuring deep-sea benthic ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
