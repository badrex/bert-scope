The author conducts experiments using a reaction between chlorine and carbon monoxide, which occurs only in light, to study the effects of light on chemical dynamics and equilibrium. The results are analyzed and discussed in terms of thermodynamics and the intrinsic properties of matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
