They discovered that when codeia is heated with hydriodic acid and phosphorus, it produces methyl iodide. The authors also found that the reaction between codeia and hydriodic acid can form different compounds depending on the temperature and conditions. These findings contribute to the understanding of the chemistry of opium alkaloids and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
