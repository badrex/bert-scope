The researchers obtained an electron density map of Rubisco from Rhodospirillum rubrum, revealing the enzyme's shape and subunit interactions. They also compared the crystal structures of Rubisco from spinach and Alcaligenes eutrophus, providing insights into the enzyme's structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
