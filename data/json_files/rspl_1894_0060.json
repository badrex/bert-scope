The error was caused by misinterpreting the orientation of the leaves, which led to incorrect illustrations and descriptions of internal structures. The corrected understanding of these structures provides valuable insights into the organization of ancient plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
