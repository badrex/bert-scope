The study covers over 60 agnathan and fish genera and highlights the influence of tectonic, biogeographical, and biostratigraphic regions on their distribution. The article also discusses the challenges in understanding the biology and paleoecology of these ancient vertebrates and their relationship to the changing environment during the Silurian and Devonian periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
