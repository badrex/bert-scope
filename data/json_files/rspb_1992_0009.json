They found that these fragments contain a mix of telomeric and subtelomeric sequences, providing insights into the structure and function of chromosome ends. This method can be used to study telomere-associated sequences and their role in chromosome maintenance and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
