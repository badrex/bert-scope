The authors explore the properties of resonance states, their correlation via the symmetric quark model, and the success of the interference model in explaining high-energy backward scattering. They also introduce the concept of the generalized interference model as a possible alternative to duality.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
