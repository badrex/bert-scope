They found that conditioning subthreshold depolarizations potentiated the calcium transient triggered by test pulses, while conditioning hyperpolarizations inhibited the calcium transient. These findings may explain similar effects of subthreshold polarizations on muscle contraction previously reported.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
