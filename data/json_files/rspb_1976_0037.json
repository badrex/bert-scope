The researchers found that the bacteria's sensitivity to ether changes during its growth cycle, with the highest sensitivity during the lag phase. The results suggest that fluctuations in substrate levels available to the light-producing enzyme are responsible for the variation in sensitivity to ether. This discovery provides insights into how ether inhibits the light emission in bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
