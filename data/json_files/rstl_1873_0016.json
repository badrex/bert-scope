They differentiate the two minerals and provide detailed descriptions of their crystallographic and optical characteristics, as well as their analyses. The author proposes the inversion of the names Amblygonite and Montebrasite due to priority, with the white or violet-tinted laminar masses from Montebras being referred to as Amblygonite, and the hydrated and lithic species found in the United States and Montebras as Montebrasite.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
