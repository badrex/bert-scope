They analyze the River Seine and estimate the amount of water needed to maintain its flow, concluding that only a small portion of the rainwater is necessary for this purpose. This study suggests that rain and snow-water can support the flow of rivers in proportion to their needs.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology"}
