They found that the energy required to form cross-links is independent of chain length, and that for every cross-link formed, approximately 0.35 C-C bonds in the main chain are fractured. This research has implications for understanding polymerization processes under radiation exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
