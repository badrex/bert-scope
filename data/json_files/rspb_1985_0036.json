The majority of duplicated muscles were not specifically innervated, suggesting that axons must follow prespecified pathways to regenerate correct connections. This finding is not consistent with long-range attraction between nerve and muscle as the primary mechanism for specific nerve regeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
