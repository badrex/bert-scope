They obtained greater detail than previous studies and found that the bands occur in pairs with a separation of about 60 cm\u207b\u00b9. The possible origin of the spectrum is discussed, and the electronic energy levels of CO\u2082 are analyzed. The findings have implications for understanding the combustion and after-burning of carbon monoxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
