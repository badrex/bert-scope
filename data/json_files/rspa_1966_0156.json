They found that the reaction is strictly first order, and the specific rate constant decreases with the increase of the initial pressure of nitrous oxide. The decrease is due to the poisoning of the catalyst by the irreversible adsorption of oxygen on the surface sites during the reaction. The study provides insights into the mechanism of the decomposition and the role of oxygen adsorption in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
