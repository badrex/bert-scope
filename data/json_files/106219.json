The experiment would help illustrate the theory of gravity and provide a better understanding of the earth's mass and matter density. The author suggests two locations in England for conducting this experiment, one near Pendle-hill and the other in a valley between Helwellin and Skidda hills.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
