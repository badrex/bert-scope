He proposes solutions to enhance the accuracy and functionality of the instrument, such as using an additional index, adjusting the telescope, and placing silver wires within the eye-tube. These improvements would benefit navigation, especially in observing the distance of the Moon from the Sun between the first and last quarter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
