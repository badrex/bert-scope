While P. bochei suppresses the host's haemocytic reaction in general, N. canescens prevents encapsulation through a coating on its eggs. The two parasitoids, belonging to different groups, use distinct methods to counteract host defenses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
