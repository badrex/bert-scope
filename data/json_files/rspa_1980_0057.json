F. Mott, shares his memories of early days in solid state physics, discussing the influences and key developments in the field during the 1930s. Mott highlights the impact of Sommerfeld's comprehensive report, the work of Harry Jones, and Herbert Skinner's experimental findings on -ray emission bands. He also touches upon the concept of the Fermi surface and its significance in understanding the behavior of electrons in solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
