It presents evidence from Cavendish's communication to Joseph Priestley, which indicates that Cavendish discovered the composition of water by mixing hydrogen and oxygen gases. The article also clears Lavoisier's name from the obloquy of unjustly claiming priority for himself.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Composition"}
