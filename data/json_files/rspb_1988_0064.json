They found that these channels are involved in regulating the resting potential within the cell cycle. Using the double patch-clamp technique, they observed oscillations in resting membrane potential and channel activity, suggesting a connection between the two.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
