They found that Cardium edule undergoes constant modifications due to changes in the composition of the water, while other species, such as Dreissena polymorpha and Hydrobia ulvae, remain unaffected. This study highlights the complex relationship between variations in animals and their surrounding conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biological adaptation"}
