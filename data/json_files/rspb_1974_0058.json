When either siphon is stimulated, both siphons close, and the stigmatal cilia stop beating simultaneously. The branchial nerve fibers form a peripheral conducting network throughout the branchial sac, with branches terminating in contact with ciliated cells. Electrical recordings show that ciliary arrest is accompanied by electrical activity, and intracellular microelectrodes reveal a negative resting potential in ciliated cells. The ciliary control in Corella may have parallels with that described for Paramecium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
