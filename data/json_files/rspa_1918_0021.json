They study the absorption coefficients of the elements and find that the energy in the spectrum is localized in the characteristic wavelengths of the metal of the anticathode. The results provide insights into the distribution of energy in the emitted radiation and the absorption of rays from different parts of the spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
