The authors develop a linear theory of antisymmetric distortion, which is more complex than the analysis of symmetric bending distortions that determine longitudinal strength. The study focuses on ships with a conventional box-like configuration and provides equations of motion and orthogonality conditions for the analysis of antisymmetric motions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ship Design and Naval Architecture"}
