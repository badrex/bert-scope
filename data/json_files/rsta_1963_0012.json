The authors evaluate the electromagnetic field produced by a uniformly moving point charge in a collisionless magneto-ionic medium and show that Cerenkov radiation in the exosphere produces low-frequency hiss. They also compute the spectral and angular distributions of radiation over the low-frequency band for specific values of plasma and gyro frequencies at various distances from the earth's center.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
