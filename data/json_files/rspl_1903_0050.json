It explores the temperature of celestial bodies, the balance between radiation push and gravitational pull, and the Doppler effect on radiating spheres. The author calculates the effective temperature of the sun and the temperature of other planets, such as Mars and Neptune.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
