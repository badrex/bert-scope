They use a gaseous source of 23Ne and detect the electron and recoil momenta to determine the angle between the beta and neutrino rays. The results suggest that the decay is a combination of Gamow-Teller and scalar-type Fermi interactions, which may violate the isotopic spin selection rule.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
