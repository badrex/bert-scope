The authors explore the functional and structural properties of glycolytic enzymes, their regulatory mechanisms, and the overall glycolytic reaction pathway. They also analyze the evolutionary optimization of enzyme turnover numbers and the role of enzyme compartmentalization and control properties in the glycolytic process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
