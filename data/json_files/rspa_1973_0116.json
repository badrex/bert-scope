The research identifies dimer absorptions for all alkanols and trifluoroethanol, and discusses the different behaviors of fluoroalcohols due to intramolecular hydrogen bonding. The findings provide insights into the self-association and hetero-association of alcohol systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy and Molecular Structure"}
