They measured the collision efficiency of hydrogen atoms with olefines and found that it lies between 10^-3 and 10^-4. The results provide insights into the effect of molecular structure on the reactivity of double bonds and suggest that the effective diameter of a more intimate part of the molecule should be used in collision efficiency calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
