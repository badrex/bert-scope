The authors found that biotite's transmission decreases significantly with increasing temperature, and they provide a detailed analysis of the transmission values and extinction coefficients for various biotite samples. Their findings contribute to the understanding of biotite's behavior in the infrared region and its potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
