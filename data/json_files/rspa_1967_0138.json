The analysis shows that sliding motion significantly influences the quasistatic stress field and the geometry of the cracks. The frictional tractions affect the criteria for surface fracture and the shape of the partially developed cones, which are determined by the Poisson ratio of the material and the coefficient of friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
