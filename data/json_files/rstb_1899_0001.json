They discovered that different colours have varying effects on the eye, with red-blindness taking around ten minutes to recover, green-blindness lasting longer, and blue-blindness taking a couple of hours. The study provides insights into the complex nature of colour perception and the potential for temporary colour-blindness.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
