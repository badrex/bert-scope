He observes that each muscle contraction consists of multiple contractions at short intervals and explains how the act of inspiration can help counteract the effects of sea-sickness. Wollaston also explores the role of external motion in assisting the circulation of blood and improving overall health.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
