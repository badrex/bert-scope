The authors discuss the distribution of water and carbon in the mantle, the stability of hydrates and carbonates, and the implications of these findings for seismic discontinuities, particularly the 410 km and 660 km discontinuities. They emphasize the importance of considering the effects of water and carbon on mantle phase transformations when interpreting seismic data.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
