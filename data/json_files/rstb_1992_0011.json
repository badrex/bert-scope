The authors present a deformable lattice model for facial tissue and a parametric muscle model to simulate facial expressions. They also explore methods for extracting control parameters from video sequences, enabling more realistic facial animation. The research has implications for improving the visual fidelity of animated faces in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Computer Graphics and Animation"}
