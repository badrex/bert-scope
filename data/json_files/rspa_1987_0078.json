The authors explore the conditions under which RLCP holds and how the wave polarization changes when the assumption of RLCP fails. They also discuss the similarities between this problem and the limiting polarization of radio waves emerging from the ionosphere into free space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
