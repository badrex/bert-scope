The method involves evaluating integrals along complex space contours and can be used to calculate the reflection coefficient, propagation constant, and coupling of ordinary and extraordinary waves in the ionosphere. The author highlights the importance of this method in understanding radio wave behavior and its potential for improving radio communication systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
