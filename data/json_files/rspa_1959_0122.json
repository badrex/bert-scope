It formulates the combustion equations and the equation of motion of the bubble's surface, assuming that the gases are ignited at the center and the flame front travels outward in the form of a sphere. The analysis shows that pressure and bubble radius increase at an increasing rate until combustion is complete, followed by radial oscillations. The study also highlights the interdependence of combustion and expansion in the bubble.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
