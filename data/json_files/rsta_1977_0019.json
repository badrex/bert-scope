These systems can achieve an accuracy of a few centimeters and have the potential for even higher accuracy with the use of streak tubes and measurements at two wavelengths. The author also explores future developments, such as improvements in reflectivity, new host materials, and the use of heterodyne detection for more accurate measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
