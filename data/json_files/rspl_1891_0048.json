The authors conducted experiments to determine the point at which color vision is lost for each part of the spectrum. They also studied color vision in colorblind individuals and found that different types of colorblindness affect the luminosity and persistency curves. The article also explores the luminosity curve of a low-intensity spectrum and its relation to color vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
