They observed an increase in intracellular ammonium content and a transient increase in intracellular pH during ammonium pulse experiments. This study suggests the possibility of ammonium influx and activation of cellular buffering mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
