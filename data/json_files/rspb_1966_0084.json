The researchers found that about 68% of the organic matter digested disappears in the stomach, 20% in the small intestine, and the remainder in the large intestine. The small intestine absorbs most of the water, chloride, phosphorus, and potassium, while the large intestine absorbs most of the sodium and continues the absorption of water and chloride. The findings provide insights into the digestion process in sheep and the effects of different diets on their digestive systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
