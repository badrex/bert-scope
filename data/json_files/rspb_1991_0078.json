MIH is a 78-residue neuropeptide with three disulphide bridges and shows some homology to the crustacean hyperglycemic hormone (CHH) neuropeptide family. This discovery provides insights into the multifunctional roles of these neuropeptides in crustacean biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Endocrinology"}
