The researchers found that chromosome linkage is constant within each species and mutant, and that this constancy contributes to the breeding behavior of small-flowered species. The study also provides a detailed account of the meiosis process in the megaspore mother-cell and the development of the four potential megaspores.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
