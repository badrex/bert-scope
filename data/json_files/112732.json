Proctor, observes that stars exhibit a drifting motion in the sky, which he terms \"star-drift.\" This phenomenon is particularly noticeable in Taurus, Gemini, Cancer, and Leo constellations. The star-drift appears to be related to the sun's motion, and Proctor suggests that stars with similar motions may form a distinct system associated with the galactic system. He also discusses the implications of star-drift for understanding the proper motions of stars and the possible center of the sidereal system.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
