They found that the band intensities were influenced by the refractive index of the medium and the molecular structure. The results provide insights into the relationship between Raman band intensities and molecular structural factors, which can help predict spectral behavior and elucidate unknown molecular structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
