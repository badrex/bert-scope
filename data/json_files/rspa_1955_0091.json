The author, A. T. James, develops a method to evaluate the distribution using an integral over the orthogonal group and simplifies the expression for specific cases. This work expands upon previous research by Anderson and Wishart, and contributes to the understanding of non-central distributions in mathematical statistics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
