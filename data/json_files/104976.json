He discovered that these animalcules appear in proportion to the degree of putrefaction in the substances. Wright suggests that further microscopical research could help investigate the septic and antiseptic qualities of substances, potentially benefiting human health.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
