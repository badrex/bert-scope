These lines were found during the investigation of a low potential and low-pressure discharge of hydrogen. The authors believe that these new lines are weak in intensity and are likely to be of great importance in understanding the behavior of hydrogen atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
