They find that a random structure, or \"chaotic reflector,\" best describes the reflective mechanism used in the skin of two species of fish they examined. This structure allows fish to be well camouflaged when viewed against the silvery surface of the water from beneath. The chaotic reflector model provides a good qualitative match to the measured reflectance, and its behavior in the infrared is well reproduced.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
