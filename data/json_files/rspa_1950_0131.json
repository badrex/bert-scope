The researchers measured wind fluctuations and correlated them with simultaneous sound intensity measurements to understand the impact of turbulence on sound propagation. The findings provide insights into the scale of turbulence and its effect on the phase relationships between signals picked up at different points.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
