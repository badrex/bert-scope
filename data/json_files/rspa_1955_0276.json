The author presents formulae that consider the impact of cross-section contraction, estuary shallowness, and bed friction on these waves. The findings can be applied to understand and predict the behavior of tides and surges in estuaries, such as the Thames Estuary.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
