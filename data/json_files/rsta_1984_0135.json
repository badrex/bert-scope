The authors find that for the lower branch of the output-input curve, the photon statistics are Poissonian, while on the upper branch, they approach Bose-Einstein statistics in the hysteresis region. The study highlights the importance of quantum fluctuations in optical bistability and their potential role in real devices and bifurcation to turbulence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Optics"}
