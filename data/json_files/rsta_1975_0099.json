The author outlines the history of ionospheric research and the key milestones in the development of the incoherent scatter theory. The article also explains the principles of incoherent scattering, including Thomson scattering by free electrons and the effect of electron density fluctuations on the scattered signal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
