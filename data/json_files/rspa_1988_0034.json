It derives asymptotic formulae for the transmission properties of such plates and presents explicit results for a plate with different bending stiffnesses in the x- and y-directions. The study focuses on the average power flow through the plate, normalized with respect to the average incident power, and provides different forms of the radiation efficiency depending on the coincidence frequencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Acoustics and Sound"}
