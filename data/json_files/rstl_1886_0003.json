{"article_id": "rstl_1886_0003", "revised_title": "On the Molecular Constitution of Liquids and Dissociation", "semantic_tags": ["Thermodynamics", "Molecular theory", "Evaporation", "Dissociation", "Gas laws"], "tldr": "The authors discuss the molecular constitution of liquids and the process of dissociation. They propose that complex molecular groups exist in liquids, which are composed of simpler gaseous molecules. The authors also study the relationship between temperature and pressure in dissociating substances, providing methods for measuring these properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
