Frederic Daniell, developed a new register-pyrometer to measure the expansions of solids and determine higher degrees of temperature on the common thermometric scale. The device consists of a black-lead earthenware bar and a porcelain index, which moves forward as the metal bar expands due to heat. This invention aimed to improve upon previous temperature-measuring instruments and expand our knowledge of metal expansion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
