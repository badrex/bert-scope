It describes the structure of transcriptionally active chromatin, the arrangement of nucleotide sequences, and the types of proteins associated with primary transcripts. The study reveals that transcriptional activity is distributed evenly throughout the genome and that lampbrush chromosomes have a distinctive structure determined by their transcriptional activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
