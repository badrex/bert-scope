The authors demonstrate that the critical stress for fracture increases with decreasing cone angle and cone radius, and with increasing volume of the meniscus of excess liquid surrounding the periphery of the cone. The findings have implications for understanding and predicting the behavior of liquids in various shearing devices, including extruders.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
