They used a microbalance technique to compare xenon to nitrogen, finding accurate density values and a molecular weight in close agreement with mass spectrograph results. This work aimed to establish xenon as a standard for comparing densities of heavy vapors, providing a valuable tool for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Laws and Properties"}
