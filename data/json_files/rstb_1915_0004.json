The authors use advanced techniques like string galvanometers to analyze the complex current changes in the heart and reveal the significance of the Purkinje system, which was previously unacknowledged by other researchers. The study also provides a detailed description of the dog's heart anatomy and its electrical conduction system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
