The authors introduce a classification system for different types of hybridization and develop a method for calculating the term values of hybrid valence states associated with these atoms. The study aims to provide a clearer understanding of the factors governing orbital hybridization and its relevance to molecular structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
