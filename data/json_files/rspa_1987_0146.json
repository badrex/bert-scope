They report a sensitivity to gravitational acceleration and discuss its potential for measuring the newtonian gravitational constant and other tests. The beam balance offers a promising alternative to traditional Cavendish balance methods for measuring gravitational effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
