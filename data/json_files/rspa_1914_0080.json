They discovered that certain elements and compounds produce characteristic radiations when exposed to alpha-rays, which can be analyzed and compared to X-ray-excited radiations. The study provides insights into the types of radiation emitted by radioactive substances and their interactions with matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
