The analysis shows that area change and friction force can cause a detonation wave to become unstable, and a criterion for a stabilized wave configuration is derived based on the competition between these source terms. The results provide insights into the stability of detonation waves in supersonic engines and ram accelerators.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics and Aerodynamics"}
