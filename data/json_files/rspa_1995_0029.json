The bimaterial consists of two semi-infinite solids bonded together or in frictionless contact, and the elastic solution is expressed in terms of hexagonal stress vectors. Closed-form solutions for various defects are provided, including inclusions, straight dislocations, disclination lines, circular dislocation loops, and point defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
