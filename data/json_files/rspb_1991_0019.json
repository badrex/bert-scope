The researchers found that by separating the intra- and extracellular signals and analyzing their relaxation mechanisms, they could estimate unidirectional potassium fluxes in intact tissues, providing a basis for further research in this area.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Physiology"}
