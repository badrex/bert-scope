The authors analyze the hydrostatic and hydrodynamic behavior of these vessels and compare their wave-induced motion response to that of rigid vessels. They also explore the design and engineering aspects of articulated-column semisubmersibles, highlighting their potential advantages over traditional fixed platforms."}
