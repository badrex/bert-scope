The unusual crystal morphology suggests that the process of crystallization is influenced by the surface chemistry at the organo-mineral interface. The study provides insights into the biological control of mineral deposition and biomineralization in various scientific fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology and Protozoology"}
