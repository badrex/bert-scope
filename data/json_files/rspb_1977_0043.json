Factors affecting akinete formation and survival of algal populations after water blooms were examined. The results suggest that akinetes may not be the primary overwintering stage of the planktonic algal life cycle, and that germination shortly after maturation may provide the greater part of the overwintering planktonic vegetative populations. Environmental factors, such as light and temperature, play a significant role in the annual cycle of growth and reproduction of algae, leading to the succession of bloom-forming species.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
