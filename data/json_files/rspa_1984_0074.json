They studied the effects of surface roughness and interfacial film strength on frictional forces and found that the coefficient of friction increases with both parameters. The results also showed that the combined coefficient of friction can be divided into adhesion and ploughing components, with the ploughing component becoming more significant as the surface roughness increases. The authors also discussed the transition period before reaching steady-state conditions and the formation of wear particles in certain cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
