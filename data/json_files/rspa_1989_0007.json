The study finds that the absorption spectra of solvated electrons are present in cyclic amides, and no new absorptions attributable to alkali-metal anions are detected. The decay of solvated electrons in these amides is also examined, providing insights into their formation and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
