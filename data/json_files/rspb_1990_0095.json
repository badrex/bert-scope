They found that the length and orientation biases are geometrically related and depend on the same underlying mechanism. The study provides evidence for cross-orientation inhibition and offers a comprehensive explanation for both the orientation and length effects in these illusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
