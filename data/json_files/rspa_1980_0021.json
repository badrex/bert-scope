The optical field amplitudes are expressed in terms of atomic source operators of surrounding absorber atoms, resulting in a mathematically identical description to the conventionally quantized optical field but with a different physical interpretation. This theory considers stationary two-level absorbing atoms and electric dipole fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
