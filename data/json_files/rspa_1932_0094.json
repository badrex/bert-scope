He proposes a scheme that accounts for the interplay between particles and fields in a simple manner, using information from classical theory. Dirac also addresses the challenges of applying relativistic ideas to higher approximations and more general problems, and suggests that a different approach is needed, building on Heisenberg's matrix theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
