It highlights that the seasonal removal of dissolved inorganic carbon from the upper water column cannot be balanced by observed particle fluxes and air-sea exchange. The research suggests that the export of DOC equals or exceeds the particle export caught in traps, indicating that DOC plays a significant role in the North Atlantic carbon balance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
