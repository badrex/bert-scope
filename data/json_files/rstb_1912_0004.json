They performed various experiments on dogs and monkeys, exploring different methods of cross-union and the efficiency of different substitute nerves. The results provided insights into the restoration of function after nerve crossing and the potential for practical applications in surgical work.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology"}
