It focuses on the role of fault orientation and the presence of weak mylonites along these zones, which can lead to reactivation. The authors provide examples of reactivated zones in Australia and discuss the importance of recognizing and understanding fault-zone reactivation in the evolution of the continental crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
