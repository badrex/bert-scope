He found that when venous blood is exposed to oxygen during respiration, the phosphorus in the corpuscles combines with oxygen to form a tribasic phosphate of soda, which gives blood its bright arterial tint. This process occurs naturally in the body and can also be artificially replicated.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
