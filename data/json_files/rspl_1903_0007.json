The author discusses secular changes, annual and diurnal inequalities, and non-cyclic effects in magnetic observations. The study finds a strong connection between magnetic phenomena and sun-spot frequencies, suggesting that increased sun-spot activity and increased magnetic activity on Earth may be due to a common external source.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
