The authors investigated various locations, including Tetel Island, Florida Group, Gizo Island, and Marau Sound, examining the geological background, contemporary reefs, and reef flats. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between tectonic movements, volcanic activity, and the formation of coral reefs in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
