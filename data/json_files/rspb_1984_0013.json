The research finds that green turtles can generate twice the propulsive force and swim six times faster than Caspian terrapins, due to their efficient swimming action and streamlined shape. The swimming performance of young green turtles is similar in efficiency to that of streamlined fish like mackerel.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Comparative Anatomy and Physiology"}
