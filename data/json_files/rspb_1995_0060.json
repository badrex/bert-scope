They found that environmental fluctuations during this period provided an advantage to sexually reproducing ostracods over parthenogenetic forms. This suggests that the short-term costs of sexual reproduction are outweighed by its advantages in a changing environment. The results support the idea that sexual reproduction offers higher evolutionary rates and resistance to parasites, while parthenogenesis may be more advantageous in stable environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
