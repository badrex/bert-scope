They found that the component molecules are arranged in alternating arrays in mixed stacks, with an order-disorder transformation occurring near 300 Kelvin. The transformation results in positional disorder of the molecules, which may explain the widespread reports of high degrees of thermal vibration in crystals of molecular compounds."}
