They found that the degree of phagocytosis increases with rising temperature, but the rate of combination of serum with the coccus is slower at lower temperatures. The study also showed that serum loses more opsonin at 37\u00b0C than at 0\u00b0C, which affects the phagocytic intake.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
