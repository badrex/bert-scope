He uses a microscope to study the structure and composition of these tissues, discovering that they consist of small globular particles. He also examines the blood vessels in the brain and finds them to be extremely fine and numerous, which he believes play a crucial role in the brain's function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
