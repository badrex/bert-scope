They discovered that the blackening of lead salts by gas is not always due to hydrogen sulfide and that the reaction between lime and bisulfide of carbon produces a new compound. The author also describes the process of obtaining red crystallized lime salt and its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
