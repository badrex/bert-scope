He later learns that it was caused by a fireball, or a large shooting star, passing overhead. The event was accompanied by a train of light and two loud booms, similar to cannon reports. Gostling believes this phenomenon may have been widespread and suggests that the Royal Society will hear about it from other regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
