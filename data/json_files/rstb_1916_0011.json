The author found that fertilized eggs have a higher electrical conductivity, indicating increased permeability to ions. This supports the theory that after fertilization, the egg surface becomes more permeable, playing a role in the development process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
