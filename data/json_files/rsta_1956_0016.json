They introduce a breakage and selection function to describe the size distribution of products from particle-breaking processes, such as ball mills, rod mills, and jaw crushers. The matrix treatment provides a practical analysis method that can be applied to various processes and helps predict the size distribution of products.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
