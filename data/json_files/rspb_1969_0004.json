The research explores two possible mechanisms: selection of cells with high oncogenicity and cellular mutation. The findings provide no evidence that the viral genome is responsible for the increase in oncogenicity and contribute to a better understanding of tumor progression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Oncogenetics"}
