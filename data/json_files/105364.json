Over time, her skin became lighter, and the change continued to spread across her body. The author, James Bate, describes the woman's physical appearance and medical history, discussing possible explanations for the phenomenon, such as the effects of heat or the action of the bile. However, Bate concludes that he cannot determine the cause of the skin color change and leaves the matter open for further investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Dermatology"}
