The author reviews the propagation of electromagnetic waves in hollow conducting tubes and the properties of the low-loss mode, which enables long-distance communication. The article describes the design and installation of a waveguide system used in a field trial and presents the results of transmission tests over the frequency band 82-110 GHz. The potential capacity of these systems is equivalent to thousands of telephone circuits or television channels, making them ideal for high-capacity communication networks.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telecommunications"}
