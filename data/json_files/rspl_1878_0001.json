They discuss the dip, intensity, and declination of the Earth's magnetic force at various locations, including the Cape of Good Hope, Bombay, Aden, Port Said, and Malta. The observations were conducted using magnetic instruments, and the results provide insights into the Earth's magnetic field and its variations over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
