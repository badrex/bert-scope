The authors present data on the Becklin-Neugebauer object in Orion, which reveals both compact ionized gas and high-excitation molecular gas, likely within a few astronomical units of the central star. The study provides insights into the physical conditions and gas dynamics in protostellar nebulae and helps to understand the relation between star formation and the surrounding interstellar clouds.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
