They found that previous theories and experiments using impure chlorophyll were not accurate, and they provided new evidence on the photochemical reactions involving chlorophyll. The study focused on the chromogen complex of the chlorophyll molecule and its interaction with light, contributing to a better understanding of the processes of carbon assimilation in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
