The model includes ionic and dust cooling and the dissipation of energy due to turbulent elements moving at supersonic speeds. The authors find that stars initially produced have masses of about 1.4, and the masses decrease as star formation continues. The model also estimates the proportion of stars that may have planetary systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
