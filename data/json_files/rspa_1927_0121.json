They found that the resistance to shear increases with the amount of distortion and that the normal force does not affect the resistance to shear. The author also investigated the effect of friction on the stress in the material and concluded that it is negligible compared to the normal load.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
