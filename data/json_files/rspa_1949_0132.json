They used a simple valency force field model to calculate frequencies and found satisfactory agreement with observed frequencies. This research helps in understanding the complex absorption spectra of paraffins, which was mainly attributed to hydrogen atom vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
