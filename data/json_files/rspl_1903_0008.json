They argue that the molecule's rotational energy, rather than free vibrations, should be considered for explaining refraction. This theory accounts for the dielectric constant, refractive index, and absorption of ultra-violet light, providing a better understanding of gas refraction phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
