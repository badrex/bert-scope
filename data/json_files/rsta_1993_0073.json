They used energy minimization and molecular modelling to study the effect of additives on the surface structure and morphology of calcite. This technique provides a valuable link between microscopic and bulk behavior, offering insights into the crystallochemical factors responsible for nucleation and growth in inorganic and biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
