The authors develop a simplified method to calculate the force, which is essential for understanding macroscopic interactions and the role of electromagnetic fluctuations in friction. The findings can help improve our understanding of the behavior of materials and their interactions in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
