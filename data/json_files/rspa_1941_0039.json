The results show that the deviations from Debye's theory are due to its assumption of a v^2 law for the frequency distribution instead of the distribution following from the atomic theory. This study provides a better understanding of the specific heat behavior of crystals at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
