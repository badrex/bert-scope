They discover that the structure of the hind part of the lower jaw and the mode of jaw articulation are key factors in understanding the relationships between early mammals. The study of the Docodonta jaw articulation helps clarify the classification of pre-Cretaceous mammals and their evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
