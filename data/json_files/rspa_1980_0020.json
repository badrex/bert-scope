They found that the cleavage strength is determined by the condition for the propagation of a microcrack that is an increasing multiple of the grain diameter. The ductility transition temperature can be explained by the intersection of a temperature-dependent flow stress with a temperature-independent cleavage strength. These findings can help improve the ductility of beryllium alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
