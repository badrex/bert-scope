The researchers use flow birefringence techniques to observe the evolution and relaxation of molecular orientation as the polymer flows through the duct. They find that the'short-time-scale' relaxation behavior depends on the entrance velocity gradient, while the 'long-time-scale' relaxation behavior has a different dependence. The findings contribute to understanding how molten polymers respond to different velocity fields in processing devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Polymer Processing"}
