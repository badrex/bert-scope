They analyze the behavior of the reaction and diffusion processes, finding distinct phases in the development of the concentrations and the formation of minimum-speed travelling waves. The results have applications in enzyme reactions and epidemiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
