The author examines the possibility of controlling atomic disintegration and extracting energy from atoms by manipulating cathode rays. The experiments conducted in a vacuum help determine the velocity of these particles and provide insights into the atomic structure and energy extraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
