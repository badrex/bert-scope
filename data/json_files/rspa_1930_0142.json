They used a specialized optical system to analyze the light and found that the nuclear moment of the thallium atom played a significant role in the structure of the lines. The study provided valuable insights into the behavior of the thallium atom and its spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
