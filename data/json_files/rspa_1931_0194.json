They found that the water-silica gel system behaves differently from other analogous systems, showing non-reproducibility of equilibrium points, inability to follow the saturation pressure of water vapor, and irreversible pressure-concentration isothermals with hysteresis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas-solid equilibria"}
