They found that fibroblasts from various tissues have different frequencies of overlapping, and the chance of overlap between cells is influenced by the nature and density of the surrounding cell population. The results suggest that overlapping behavior between cells is complex and depends on multiple factors, making it difficult to predict the results of untested combinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
