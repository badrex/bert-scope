These antifreeze molecules, found in the blood of cold-water fish, lower the freezing point of water and inhibit ice growth, allowing the fish to survive in freezing environments without freezing. The study focuses on the molecular structure and properties of these antifreeze agents and their impact on the survival of polar fishes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
