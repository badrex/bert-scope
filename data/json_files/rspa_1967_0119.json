The author presents the appropriate variational principle for water waves and derives long-wave approximations, such as the Boussinesq and Korteweg-de Vries equations. The paper also explores resonant near-linear interactions and the author's theory of slowly varying wavetrains, which are applied to Stokes's waves. Finally, the paper demonstrates how more general dispersive relations can be formulated using integro-differential equations, with an application to understanding the breaking of water waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
