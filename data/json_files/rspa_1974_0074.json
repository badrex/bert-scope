They discover that explosives ignite due to localized thermal energy or 'hot spots' created by mechanical shock. The study provides a detailed understanding of the physical processes occurring during impact and helps establish a history of the stress and deformation conditions in the layer of material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
