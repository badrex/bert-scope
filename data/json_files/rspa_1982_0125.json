They investigate the interaction between the chemical reaction process and the adsorption process, which can break the local thermodynamic equilibrium limitation by forming a stationary shock front inside the reactor. The performance characteristics of the countercurrent reactor are compared with those of the conventional fixed-bed reactor.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemical Engineering > Reaction kinetics and catalysis"}
