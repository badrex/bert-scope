They explore the importance of chemical specificity in understanding the relationship between enzymes and substrates, as well as the specific action of local hormones. The author also examines the role of stereochemistry in enzyme-substrate interactions and its potential applications in understanding the action of local hormones.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
