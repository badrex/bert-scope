Hofmann, investigates the molecular constitution of organic bases and alkaloids, specifically focusing on the reaction between triethylamine and iodide of ethyl. He discovers a new iodide compound with the formula C16H20NI and discusses its properties and formation. This research contributes to a better understanding of the molecular structure and chemical reactions of organic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
