They found that the circulation of blood continues even after the heart has stopped beating, and the contractile power of the heart is one of the main sources of this power. The author also discovered that other factors, such as the resilience of the lungs and the act of inspiration, have little effect on blood circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
