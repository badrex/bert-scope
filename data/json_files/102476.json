The victims' clothes and bodies were riddled with holes, and their injuries resembled burns and dry, healed wounds. The survivors' wounds took a long time to heal, and some required unconventional treatments like oil of St. John's-wort and the black salve. The author provides a detailed account of the incident, including witness statements and his own thoughts on the natural causes of the accident.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Thunderstorms and Lightning"}
