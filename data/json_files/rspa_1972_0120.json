They propose a model for the mechanism of nucleation of recrystallization in transition bands and discuss the dependence of these processes on crystallographic orientation, relating it to the formation of recrystallization textures in body-centered cubic metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metal Metallurgy"}
