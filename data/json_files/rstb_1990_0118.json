The fauna indicates a large, well-oxygenated river, thought to be the ancestral Thames, and suggests a Cromerian age. The study also highlights significant differences in faunas at different sampling sites and discusses the implications of these findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
