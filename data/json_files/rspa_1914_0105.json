They discovered that the current and ionization of the vapor depend on the shape and position of the cathode, while the anode's position has little effect. The author explains the observed facts by considering the mobility of negative ions and the recombination of positive and negative ions in the vicinity of the cathode.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
