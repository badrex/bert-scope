The research demonstrates the significance of these factors in controlling properties such as extinction limits and the completeness of combustion within the flame. The findings contribute to the understanding of flame extinguishment and the development of flame inhibitors and suppressants.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
