They used the photoelastic effect to study the internal stresses and discovered that silver chloride deforms by 'pencil glide', a mechanism previously postulated for the plastic behavior of iron. The findings provide insights into the deformation process of crystalline materials and the role of dislocations in plasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
