They observed the interaction of regular gravity waves with immersed and semi-immersed flat plates and found that the exit geometry of the flow significantly affects eddy formation. The energy losses associated with these flows were examined, and the contribution from eddy formation was identified. This research has implications for the efficient operation of wave energy devices and other areas of marine and hydraulic engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
