They found that the corpora lutea play a role in inhibiting oestrus during pregnancy, while the placenta is essential for suppressing oestrus during the second half of gestation. The results suggest that the placenta produces the hormone progestin, which is responsible for inhibiting oestrus during pregnancy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
