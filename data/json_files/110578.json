He explores the variation of the given integral, which is composed of two distinct parts: a triple integral and another part determined from the limits of the triple integral. This work contributes to the understanding of optimization problems and the solution of equations in mathematical analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus of Variations"}
