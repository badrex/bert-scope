The results show that mice of different strains experience changes in fertility and nestling mortality over generations. Hybrid mice show improvements in nestling survival rates and weight gain in cold environments, while inbred mice maintain consistent breeding performance in warmer conditions. The findings suggest that these changes may be due to cumulative maternal effects or a decline in the action of pathogenic organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior and Adaptation"}
