He found that by closing the nose and mouth and expanding the chest, the ear becomes insensitive to low tones. Wollaston also observed that there is a wide range of hearing abilities among individuals, with some people unable to hear sounds as high as six octaves above middle E on a piano. This research suggests that the limits of human hearing are more confined than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
