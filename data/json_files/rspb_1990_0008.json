The authors conducted surveys to examine the distribution of species on the main island, Madeira, and found a faunal discontinuity between the eastern peninsula and the rest of the island. The peninsula has distinctive species and species with relict distributions. The authors discuss the possible reasons for these patterns, including allopatric speciation in a geologically unstable region and the influence of habitat, environment history, and colonization processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
