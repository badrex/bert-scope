He collaborated closely with J.S. Haldane and made significant contributions to understanding the regulation of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the body. His research on altitude physiology and the effects of hypoxia and exercise on breathing paved the way for further advancements in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
