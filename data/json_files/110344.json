He proposed a method to measure the intensity independently of the individual nature of the needles used in experiments. Gauss also developed two different ways to compare the effects of the magnetism of the earth and a first needle on a second needle, suspended by a thread. His work aimed to improve the precision of magnetic observations, expecting that they would soon reach a level nearly equal to that of delicate astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
