The researchers used light microscopy and autoradiography to analyze the process and found that the rate of rod outer segment renewal in Xenopus is more than twice that reported for red rods in Rana under similar experimental conditions. The study provides insights into the photoreceptor and pigment epithelium morphology in adult Xenopus retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
