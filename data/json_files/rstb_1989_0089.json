It explores the diverse and abundant fossil record of phytoplankton, which provides insights into the changing environments and evolutionary responses of marine life. The article also examines the major patterns of diversification and extinction in phytoplankton during the late Proterozoic and Paleozoic eras, as well as the innovations and radiations in the Mesozoic era.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
