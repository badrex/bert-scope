They found that electronic conductivity in the high-temperature phase exhibits a stoichiometry-controlled transition, while ionic conductivity remains relatively constant. The study provides valuable insights into the conduction mechanisms in silver selenide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
