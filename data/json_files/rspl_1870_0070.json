Eosite has unique crystallographical and chemical properties, and its presence in cerussite provides insight into the composition of lead ores. The author also discusses the properties and reactions of eosite with various reagents, such as hydrochloric acid, alcohol, and bisulfate of potash.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
