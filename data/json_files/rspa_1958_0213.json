The author presents a proof of its causal property and a new proof of its relation to -matrix elements, providing a generalization of the work of Lehmann, Symanzik, and Zimmermann. The generalized retarded product is defined and its properties are investigated, including its connection to -matrix elements and dispersion relations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
