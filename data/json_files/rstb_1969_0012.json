The study examines the three main faunal elements in the region and discusses the factors influencing their distribution, such as island size, ecological diversity, and human intervention in dispersal. The article also explores the historical context of mollusk distribution in the Pacific region, including the possible origins of certain families and the impact of continental drift on their distribution patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Malacology"}
