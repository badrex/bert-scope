The research examines the petrology of sediments, provenance and dispersal factors, and the influence of inherited features on present facies distribution. The findings reveal a complex interplay of bathymetric, hydrological, ecological, and provenance factors, with diverse sediment compositions and granulometric characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
