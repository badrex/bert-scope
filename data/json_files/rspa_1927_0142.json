The authors explore the adherence between surfaces and the role of liquid films in enhancing that adherence. They also describe two methods for measuring the thickness of the wringing film, the Area Method and the Interferometer Method. The findings provide a qualitative explanation of the wringing process and its applications in workshop practice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
