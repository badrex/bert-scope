They also discovered that adrenalin can induce rhythmic contractions in quiescent rings from the superior vena cava near the heart, suggesting a connection to the myogenic theory of heart rhythmicity. This research provides insight into the role of adrenalin and the sympathetic nervous system in vein and heart function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
