It presents optimization criteria for energy-selected and time-selected migration and evaluates the effects of body size, wing morphology, and horizontal winds on flight strategies. The study concludes that minimizing transport costs is not the only critical selective factor, and that resulting migration speed is an important selective force in bird migration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
