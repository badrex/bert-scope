They find that helium is a nearly universal constituent of minerals when using refined methods of isolation. The study also examines the relationship between the amount of helium and the geological age of the minerals, as well as the potential presence of argon in minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
