The experiment aimed to increase sensitivity and improve the measurement of arrival time differences in signals recorded by mirror groups. This method allowed for continuous tracking of the object and better rejection of background radiation due to cosmic ray protons. The experiment had the potential to increase sensitivity up to tenfold compared to previous methods."}
