This local depolarization, called the end-plate potential, triggers a new impulse in the muscle fiber. The mechanism of the end-plate potential is different from the one associated with spike activity, as it is induced by acetylcholine and involves a membrane short-circuit, leading to depolarization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
