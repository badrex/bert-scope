It highlights the importance of understanding energy balance when dealing with crack extension and fracture toughening mechanisms. The author emphasizes that a clear distinction should be made between energy balances based on the first and second laws of thermodynamics, as they yield different results and insights.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
