They found sequence heterogeneity in the carboxy-terminal half of the chain and identified a potential glycosylation site in the protein encoded by one of the clones. The study also demonstrated that the presence of a Hind III restriction site can be used as a marker for the isotypic variation between C4 and C4-S1p genes in most mouse strains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
