They used a modified pressure apparatus to observe the behavior of substances like potassic iodide, bromide of potassium, ferric chloride, and others in various solvents, such as alcohol, carbon disulfide, and paraffin spirit. The experiments showed that some substances remained in solution at high temperatures, while others separated out or underwent chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solubility and Phase Transitions"}
