They discovered that when these stimuli are applied simultaneously, they can produce rhythmic responses in muscles, which resemble the movements of progression. This research provides insight into the central origin of rhythmic activity in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
