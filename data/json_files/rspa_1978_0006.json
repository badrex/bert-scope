They found that oxygen interaction with both crystal planes resulted in the growth of orthorhombic oxide on both Pb(100) and Pb(110), while hydrogen sulphide dissociated on pre-oxidized surfaces, leading to surface sulphidation. The study provides insights into the structural aspects of surface reactions and the role of oxygen-hydrogen interaction in the sulphidation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
