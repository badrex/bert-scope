Julius warns against attributing all dark bands in the absorption spectrum to absorption alone, while Wood believes there is a difference between their views on the disappearance of light between the D-lines. The article also highlights the importance of further investigating the connection between anomalous dispersion and solar phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
