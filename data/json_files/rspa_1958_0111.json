They show that if the shell is perfectly rigid, total reflexion occurs. Quasi-periodic incident waves lead to a completely periodic standing wave state between the reflector and a central wave-source, with the field outside the system remaining static.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
