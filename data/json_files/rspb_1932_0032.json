They discovered its chemical structure and compared it to biliverdin, finding similarities in their properties. Uteroverdin is derived from the hemoglobin of maternal blood, and its presence in the placenta may play a role in the nutrition of the fetus. The authors also discuss the similarities between uteroverdin and oocyan, another green pigment found in eggshells of birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Pigment and Placenta Biology"}
