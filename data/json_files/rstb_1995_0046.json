The authors conclude that the hydrophobic core collapse model, which involves the assembly of non-polar residues into a good core, best explains the two-state cooperativity of protein folding. This model is supported by experimental evidence showing the development of hydrophobic clusters and cores concurrent with secondary structure formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
