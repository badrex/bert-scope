He explains how the scattering of alpha particles through large angles can provide valuable information about the forces within the atom and the nature of its nucleus. Rutherford's experiments and theories laid the foundation for modern atomic theory and nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
