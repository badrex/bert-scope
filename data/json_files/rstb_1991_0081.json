It discusses the preservation and decay mechanisms of biopolymers and other biomolecules, considering factors such as molecular structure, depositional environment, and diagenetic history. The study of fossil biomolecular structures can provide insights into paleoenvironments and evolution. The article highlights the importance of analytical chemistry techniques in understanding biomolecular preservation and decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Geochemistry"}
