The author explains that these stresses can be caused by plate-boundary forces, density heterogeneities within the plates, and mass heterogeneities in the deep mantle. The study focuses on the relationship between mass anomalies and the stress field, showing that the influence of these anomalies is proportional to their moment, which is the product of their amplitude and depth. The author also provides examples of geological cases where tectonic stresses are influenced by mass anomalies.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
