They found that two distinct processes are involved in the decomposition: the first stage may involve free radicals, while the second stage does not. The second stage, which the authors focus on, leads to the formation of olefines, hydrogen, methane, and mixed polymers. The ratio of carbon in the polymer to carbon in methane depends on the hydrogen concentration during the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
