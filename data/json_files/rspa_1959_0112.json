The authors analyze the effects of adsorption, surface flow, and pore geometry on the diffusion of permanent and noble gases. They find that the catalyst plugs have a higher degree of microporosity and more complex pore structures than the other materials, while porous glass and carbon plugs have more uniform pore structures. The results provide insights into the design and optimization of cracking catalysts for industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
