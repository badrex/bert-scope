They discovered that the ultra-ionization potential losses in these elements could be explained by the excitation of inner electrons, a process that had not been previously recognized in electron collision experiments. This finding connects optical and X-ray spectra and provides a better understanding of atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
