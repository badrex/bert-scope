They find a remarkable correspondence between the two theories, suggesting that the success of the resonance theory is due to this unexpected connection. The study focuses on alternant systems and explores the implications of this correspondence for understanding molecular behavior and chemical reactivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
