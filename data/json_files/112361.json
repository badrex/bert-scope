Rennoldson observed prominences and the corona on the moon. He used a spectroscope to see two prominences with a yellow flame color and a red, yellowish green, blue, and violet-colored corona. The observations were made on board the ship, and due to the ship's motion and haze, precise observations were challenging.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
