The author proposes that these concepts are represented by image-schemas, which are created through a process of perceptual analysis. This conceptual system allows infants to learn language by providing an interface between continuous perception and the discrete propositional forms of language.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Development"}
