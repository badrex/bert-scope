The author discusses the differences between these conventions and their impact on understanding adsorption and surface chemistry. The study focuses on systems with two bulk phases in equilibrium, exploring the relationships between surface excess, surface tension, and osmotic pressure. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding these conventions to accurately interpret experimental results and develop a clearer physical picture of surface phenomena."}
