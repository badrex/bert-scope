The authors review the use of angular-dependent interatomic potentials and atomistic simulations to understand the bonding between constituent atoms in intermetallics, focusing on titanium and nickel aluminides. They explain the importance of these materials for high-temperature applications due to their strength, stiffness, and oxidation resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Materials Modelling"}
