The method involves expressing the load pattern as a function of the unknown forces in one non-redundant member and the redundant members. By maximizing the load pattern subject to the elliptical approximation, an estimate of the elastic critical load of the redundant framework is obtained.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
