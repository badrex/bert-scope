They found that the addition of impurities significantly decreases the thermal conductivity and alters its temperature dependence. The results are in fair agreement with the theory of impurity scattering by electrons or holes in the impurity energy levels. This study provides insights into the behavior of thermal conduction in these materials and the impact of impurities on their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
