It focuses on the activation of the myc oncogene in B and T lymphoid tumours, exploring the chromosome translocations that occur and their effects on myc expression. The article also examines the consequences of these translocations on cell cycle control and tumour formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
