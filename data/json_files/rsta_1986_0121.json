The technique involves the interaction of laser-generated Rayleigh pulses with surface-breaking slots, providing a diagnostic method for measuring defect depths. The authors present experimental results and discuss the potential of this method for detecting and characterizing surface defects in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
