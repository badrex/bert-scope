The authors found that resonance radiation imprisonment significantly affects the reaction rates, and that the decomposition of deutero-ammonia is more susceptible to inhibition than ammonia. The study provides insights into the secondary reactions responsible for the reactivity of these molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
