The ciliate's presence in the host's haemocoel and its impact on host population dynamics and insect immunity are discussed. The article also describes the collection, maintenance, and examination methods for studying this ciliate-parasite relationship.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ciliate Biology"}
