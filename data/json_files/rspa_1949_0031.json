They used photographic emulsions to measure the energy and track the particles, finding that the energy distribution of protons can be explained by simple evaporation theory. The observations also revealed a high-energy tail consisting of direct knock-on protons and slow mesons. The authors discuss the implications of their findings and the methods used in their research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
