They found that high temperatures and low humidity contribute to the decline of rat fleas, which play a significant role in the spread of the plague. The author also discovered that a certain level of dryness, indicated by saturation deficiency, can prevent the continuation of plague epidemics. This research allows for the forecasting of epidemics by monitoring climatic conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Health"}
