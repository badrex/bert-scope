He refutes previous theories on dentition and identifies two sets of teeth in mammals, called 'Monophyodonts' and 'Diphyodonts'. The author introduces a new notation system for teeth based on their homologies, which can be applied co-extensively within the mammalian class.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
