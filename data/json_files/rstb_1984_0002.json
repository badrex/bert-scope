It discusses the two layers of peat-forming systems, the acrotelm and catotelm, and their respective rates of decay. The author highlights the consequences of the slow decay in the catotelm, such as the steady-state accumulation of peat, the potential for inaccurate reconstructions of past vegetation, and the release of methane gas. The article provides a model for understanding peat formation and its implications for the study of peatlands.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
