They formulate the eikonal equation approximation and show how it can be solved numerically, providing significant computational advantages over solving the original reaction-diffusion system. The eikonal equation helps predict configurations and geometric stabilities of waves in specific domains, such as narrow slits, and is applicable to problems in physiology, biology, and chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Partial Differential Equations > Reaction-Diffusion Equations"}
