The apparatus allows for precise readings of resting heat production, recovery heat production, and the total heat produced during muscle contractions. This innovative method provides a better understanding of muscle metabolism and energy exchanges.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
