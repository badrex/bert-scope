The authors explore the hypothesis of Hide, Roberts, and Scott, considering the core as a perfect conductor, and discuss the implications of this hypothesis for the geomagnetic secular variation. They also analyze the viscous and magnetic boundary layers in the core at its boundary with the mantle to understand how accurately observed values of the geomagnetic field reflect the values at the top of the free stream, where velocity information is hoped to be obtained.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
