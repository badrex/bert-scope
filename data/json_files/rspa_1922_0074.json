They assume a small disturbance from a state of rotation and derive a mathematical model to describe the motion. The sphere oscillates about a point on its axis, and the amplitude of oscillation tends to zero while the period tends to a constant value. The study provides insights into the behavior of fluids and solid objects in rotating systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
