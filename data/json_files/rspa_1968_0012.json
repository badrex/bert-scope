The spectrometer allows for the monitoring of radical decay curves and the recording of ESR displays for different time intervals after the flash. This technique has potential applications in photochemistry and can provide both spectrum and kinetic data for chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
