The research shows that the rate of thymidine phosphorylation increases during the growth of the stalk and the formation of the species-specific cap. This increase occurs independently of the cell nucleus, suggesting that there is a cytoplasmic regulation of enzymes involved in DNA synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
