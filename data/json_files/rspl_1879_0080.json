One of these lines coincided with a line observed in the spectrum of calcium at A, 3968'0 (H). The author also discussed the limitations of the Capillary Electroscope in measuring electromotive force and the need for more accurate measuring instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
