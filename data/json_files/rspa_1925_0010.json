The authors found that alternating current increases the current output of the cell, with the effect being more significant at the carbon electrode. They also studied the impact of alternating current on electrode potentials and observed that the alternating current influences the velocity of the sulfate formation near the zinc anode.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
