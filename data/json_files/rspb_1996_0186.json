They found that higher-taxon richness, such as genera or families, can be a useful surrogate for species richness in guiding tropical conservation efforts. However, the precision of predicting species richness from higher-taxon richness was often low, particularly for rich sites, and the performance of higher taxa as surrogates dropped sharply with increasing taxonomic rank.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
