They found that the bands have a unique intensity distribution and discussed the vibrational and rotational intervals of the bands. The study provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen molecules and the underlying quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
