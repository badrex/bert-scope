They provide detailed descriptions of the eggs, first, second, third, and fourth larval instars, and discuss the differences in bristle patterns that help distinguish between the species. This study contributes to the understanding of Phlebotomus species identification and classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
