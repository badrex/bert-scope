These hydrocarbons were found to be colorless, oily liquids that combined with bromine and nitric acid. The author also observed that these hydrocarbons could be oxidized into various acids and compounds. The findings suggest that these hydrocarbons might be polymers of the acetylene series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
