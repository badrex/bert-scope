The authors examine the accuracy of recent parametrizations and solutions of the Percus-Yevick and hypernetted-chain equations for these pair correlations. The Born-Green, Lovett-Mou-Buff-Wertheim, and Lebowitz-Percus sum rules are derived and used to analyze the pair-correlation functions and their relation to density profiles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical mechanics"}
