The method is based on solving a hyperfinite-dimensional version of the equation, and the standard part of the solution gives the required weak solution of the Navier-Stokes equations. This approach simplifies and shortens the original proofs, making them more accessible.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analysis"}
