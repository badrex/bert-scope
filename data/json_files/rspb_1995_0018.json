They find that a quarter of these species have a probability of extinction equal to 1, and a further third have probabilities of greater than 0.1, with most likely times to attain the threshold of a single individual being 50 years or less. The results suggest a poor prognosis for many species and pose a challenge to conservation agencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Conservation Biology"}
