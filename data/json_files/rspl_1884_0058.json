They observe the formation of gill slits, the development of the nervous system, and the role of the notochord-like structure in supporting the proboscis and collar. This research contributes to understanding the evolutionary relationships between invertebrates and vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
