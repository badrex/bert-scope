The enzyme has a high affinity for glutamine and can also use ammonia as a substrate. The enzyme is inhibited by \u03b1-oxo acids, and its physiological role is discussed. The authors also investigate the substrate specificity of the enzyme with analogues of glutamine, aspartate, and asparagine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
