The authors develop a systematic technique using a Hamiltonian and Green functions to study the interactions between atoms and the behavior of electrons in systems with finite temperature. This approach allows for a better understanding of electron propagation and the calculation of free energy in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
