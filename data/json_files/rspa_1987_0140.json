The authors analyze three cases of spherical blast waves propagating into a dusty medium with different dust distributions. They find that the presence of dust weakens the blast wave, reducing the gas velocity, temperature, and pressure behind the blast-wave front. The dust also changes the shape of the blast-wave pressure signature and creates a bell-shaped pattern in the dust spatial-density distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
