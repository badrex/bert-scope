They calculated the Young modulus in the chain direction and the lateral Young moduli, finding surprisingly high values. The study provides a better understanding of cellulose's properties and highlights the importance of hydrogen bonds in determining its elastic constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Polymer Chemistry"}
