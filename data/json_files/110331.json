The telescope has an aperture of eight inches and a length of eight feet nine inches. Barlow discusses the principles and calculations he applied in the construction of the telescope and how its performance matched the computed results. The author leaves the evaluation of the telescope's performance to the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telescope design"}
