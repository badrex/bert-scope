{"article_id": "108131", "revised_title": "Reevaluating the Non-Existence of Metamorphoses in Crustacea", "semantic_tags": ["Zoology", "Crustacea", "Metamorphosis", "Invertebrates", "Transformation"], "tldr": "The author examines the long-held belief that crustaceans do not undergo metamorphosis and presents evidence of transformations in crustaceans, specifically in the Zoea stage. The author argues that these transformations are different from those seen in insects and involve changes in the number and form of limbs, as well as the development of new organs. This challenges the idea that metamorphosis is not a characteristic of crustaceans and opens up new avenues for understanding their life cycles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
