They concluded that the black particles are composed of a large, branching fungus, while the white particles consist of caseous material and a lowly organized fungus. The study provides insights into the nature and characteristics of the fungi involved in mycetoma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
