The researchers discovered an intricate association of smooth endoplasmic reticulum, microtubules, and synaptic vesicles at the presynaptic grid-active zone of synapses. They suggest that the presynaptic dense projections in conventional material may, in part, originate from improperly fixed smooth endoplasmic reticulum at these points. This finding may be related to calcium ion translocation and the function of the presynaptic membrane.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
