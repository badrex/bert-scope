They found that the refraction-equivalent of a compound is the sum of the refraction-equivalents of its constituents. The author also discovered that the refraction-equivalents of metal salts differ based on the nature of the electro-negative constituents. This research provided insights into the optical properties of metals and their compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Compounds and Reactions"}
