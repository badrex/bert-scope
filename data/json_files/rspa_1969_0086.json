This new equation accurately represents the behavior of electrolytes at high concentrations and is applicable to a wide range of electrolyte types. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this equation by comparing it to previous models and experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
