They determine the optimal spacing of bulkheads to maximize protection while minimizing the impact on loading and unloading efficiency. The study focuses on cargo steamers and considers the type of vessel, freeboard, permeability, and floodable length.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval architecture"}
