E. Baxandall, discovered a new line in the helium spectrum near 4686. They found that this line was similar to a line in the spectra of stars and the Sun's chromosphere. They also found that this line was likely part of the hydrogen spectrum, and they suggested further research to study the helium spectrum under different electrical conditions to find more connections with the hydrogen spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
