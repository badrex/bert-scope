It analyzes the base of the limb, including the body, coxa, and basis, in various crustacean orders. The author discovers common features in the limb orientation and movement, which are crucial for walking and adapting to different environments. The research also discusses the evolution of walking mechanisms in malacostracan crustaceans and the role of the marsupium in shaping limb morphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Zoology"}
