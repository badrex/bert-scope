They compared their experimental results with theoretical predictions from modern nuclear theories and found that the theoretical values were not accurate in the soft-ray region. This study contributed to the understanding of nuclear physics and beta decay processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
