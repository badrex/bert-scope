They find discrepancies in the calculated values of X2 and the observed positions of absorption bands for various substances. The author discusses possible solutions to these discrepancies and suggests the need for alternative dispersion formulas that better align with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
