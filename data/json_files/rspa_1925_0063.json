The authors find that the selective nature of hydrogenation is influenced by the unsaturation and the presence of functional groups in the organic molecule. They also use this knowledge to suggest the structural formulae of complex terpene compounds, such as citral and carvone, by examining their hydrogenation patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
