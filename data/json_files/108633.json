They found that allylic alcohol has a pungent odor, is combustible, and is similar in composition to acetone and propylic aldehyde. The authors also studied the reactions and properties of allylic alcohol, including its transformation into acrolein and allylic acid, and its reaction with various oxidizing agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
