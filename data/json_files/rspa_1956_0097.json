They found that the observed collision factors were greater for deuterium than hydrogen, especially in catalysis by fluoride ion. This phenomenon can only be explained by invoking the tunnel effect, suggesting that the motion of the proton is non-classical in nature. The results provide insights into the understanding of reaction kinetics and the role of isotopes in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Reaction Kinetics"}
