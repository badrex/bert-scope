They found that perbenzoic acid is the most satisfactory reagent for this purpose. The results indicate that the unsaturation in cyclized rubber samples is below 20% of that in the original rubber, supporting a polycyclic structure rather than a structure with single rings involving two isoprene units. The kinetics of the cyclization reaction in solution and catalyzed by stannic chloride were also studied, revealing the average size of the polycyclic structures formed and the reaction's rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
