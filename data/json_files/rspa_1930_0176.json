They found that a substance is formed by the light, which makes the mixture more explosive. This substance accumulates until it reaches a concentration that balances its formation and decay. The authors also found that the active substance is destroyed at the walls of the container, and only a small fraction of the collisions with the wall are effective in destroying it.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
