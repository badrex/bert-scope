They found that the spiral structure is common to all cotton seed hairs, regardless of variety, and is not influenced by genetic or environmental differences. The study suggests that the reversals may be related to the growth rate of the hairs and may provide insights into the growth process of cotton plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
