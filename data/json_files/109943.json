He connected a glass syphon to the trachea of animals and measured the height of the water column to ascertain the pressure exerted by the lungs. The results showed that the spring of air compressed by a column of water was not equal to the rebounding spring of the lungs at their usual stage of dilatation. Carson also made observations on artificial respiration and determining the actual quantity of air in the lungs after complete expiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
