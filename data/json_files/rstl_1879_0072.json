E. H. Gordon, conducted a series of measurements on the specific inductive capacities of transparent dielectrics under the guidance of Professor J. Clerk Maxwell. They used a unique 5-plate balance and a rapidly reversed electrification system to overcome the challenges of measuring these capacities accurately. Their experiments tested Professor Maxwell's electromagnetic theory and provided valuable insights into the behavior of dielectrics and their applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
