The author traces the lineage of these starfish through different zones and localities, providing insights into their morphology, ornamentation, and environmental influences. The study also discusses the classification and nomenclature of these species, as well as the significance of their fossil record for understanding the history of life on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
