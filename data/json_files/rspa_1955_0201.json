The author shows that the spin-wave theory's ground state contains a significant contribution from fictitious states, which affects the accuracy of the theory's predictions. The author suggests that the spin-wave theory may be valid for larger values of the anisotropic term, but this remains uncertain.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
