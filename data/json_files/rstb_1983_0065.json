The author argues that understanding how we perceive and recognize faces in everyday life can help explain memory processes for faces in laboratory settings. The study demonstrates the importance of structural codes in recognizing familiar faces and the impact of changes in facial expressions and poses on recognition memory.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
