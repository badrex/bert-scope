They find that the flagella are composed of multiple fibrous elements, or filaments, held in a regular array and made up of a limited number of helices. The two models, based on hexagonal packing of helices, are derived from the diffraction pattern and provide insights into the structure and arrangement of bacterial flagella.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
