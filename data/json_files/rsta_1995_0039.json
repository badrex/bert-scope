The authors used boundary-layer budgets and various measurement techniques to estimate methane fluxes from peat bogs in Scotland. They found that daytime and nighttime fluxes varied significantly, with daytime fluxes being generally larger. The results highlight the importance of understanding methane sources and sinks to better comprehend their impact on climate change.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
