The model is used to study transitions between localized surface states and can be extended to cover states that are localized in one dimension. This approach provides a link between the shape of the image and the dependence of scattering probability on impact parameter, offering advantages in spatial resolution and image quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
