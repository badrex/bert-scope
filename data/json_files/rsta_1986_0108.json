The resonance frequency of a vibrating structure is sensitive to thermal, mechanical, and electrical perturbations, allowing for the detection and measurement of small temperature gradients and stresses in piezoelectric crystals. The resonant method also provides access to the nature and concentration of impurities. The author demonstrates the application of these techniques to quartz crystals, discussing temperature gradients, stresses, and impurities, and their effects on the frequency of the resonator.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
