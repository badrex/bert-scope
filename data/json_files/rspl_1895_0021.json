It highlights the influence of geodetic investigation on the Great Trigonometrical Survey of India and the discrepancies met with at baseline and triangle junctions. The article also explores the deflections of the plumb line due to local attractions and the need to eliminate these errors in determining the Earth's figure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
