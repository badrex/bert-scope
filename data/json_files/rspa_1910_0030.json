The researchers found that the brightness of the arc increased with pressure, and all lines examined were broadened by pressure, with the broadening increasing with pressure. The study also showed that some lines reversed under pressure, while others maintained the same relative intensity. The results provide insights into the behavior of titanium under high-pressure conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
