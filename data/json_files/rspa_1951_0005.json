They used a thin vapour target and a more reliable method to measure voltage, comparing the yield of alpha-particles from the T-D reaction with the yield of protons from the D-D reaction. The results disagreed with previous resonance formulae and suggested that a conventional theory postulating a reaction at a distance equal to the sum of the nuclear radii could not explain the reaction. The evidence for a low-energy resonance was considered inconclusive.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
