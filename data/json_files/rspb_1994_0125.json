Dominant males in these communally breeding groups do not guard their mates and rarely interrupt the copulations of unrelated rival males. DNA fingerprinting revealed a tendency for alpha males to father the majority of offspring, but frequent, uninterrupted copulations by subordinate birds assured that most males within the group had at least some paternity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
