They introduce a new treatment for diffusion through widely non-uniform media and provide a continuous variation of counter-ion concentrations, which helps to explain the observed variation of the diffusion coefficient of imbibed electrolyte with concentration.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
