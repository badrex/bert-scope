The author presents a method to calculate the retardation, which can be extended to any order, and explains the relationship between corresponding terms in the equation and the roots of a biquadratic equation. The findings have implications for understanding light behavior in biaxal crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
