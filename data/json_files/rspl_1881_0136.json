They found that coal-dust can be ignited by fire-damp explosions, causing the flame to travel further and be self-sustaining. The author also observed that proper ventilation and preventing the accumulation of coal-dust can help prevent such accidents. These findings can help improve mine safety and prevent future colliery explosions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mining and Mineral Resources"}
