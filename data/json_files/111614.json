He also studied the reactions of these compounds with various reagents, such as hydrochloric acid, potassium hydroxide, and silver acetate. Simpson's work expanded the understanding of glycol chemistry and laid the foundation for further research in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
