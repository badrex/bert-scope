This method allows for regular meteorological registration and can be used to determine the intensity of light and its effects on chemical reactions. The author also discusses the accuracy and trustworthiness of the method, providing results from various observations and measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
