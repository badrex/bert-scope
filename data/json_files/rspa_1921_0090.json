They found that radiations of different frequencies do not act independently in producing the photochemical change, and the efficiency depends on the total amount of energy absorbed by the photographic grains, regardless of the different frequencies. This discovery helps to understand the photographic efficiency of various light sources and improve photographic technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
