The experiment shows that the thorax shape changes when the hoop's orientation is adjusted to match the position of the lower dorsal region of the human vertebral column. This suggests that gravitation plays a significant role in shaping the thorax in both health and disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
