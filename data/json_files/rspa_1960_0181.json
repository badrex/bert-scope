They found that the two myoglobin molecules have a very similar tertiary structure despite differences in amino-acid composition. The study provides insights into the similarities and differences between the positions of heavy atoms in the seal and sperm-whale myoglobin molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
