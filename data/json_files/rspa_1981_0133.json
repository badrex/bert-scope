The results are compared with recent approximate calculations, and some applications are discussed. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the two-dimensional Lennard-Jones system, which is useful for discussing physisorbed systems and understanding phase transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical mechanics"}
