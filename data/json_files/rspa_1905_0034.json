The results showed that the specific heat of diamond decreased to 1/19 and graphite to 1/10 between ordinary temperatures and the boiling point of hydrogen. The study also revealed that the specific heat of graphite was about three times that of the diamond at the lowest temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
