The author presents a more accurate solution to the stability equations and compares the results with experimental findings, showing good agreement between them. The theoretical discussion and numerical work focus on a steel strip, with the main findings indicating that the strip becomes unstable at a specific twist value, forming a series of loops on the twisted strip.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
