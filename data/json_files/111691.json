They found that completely frozen muscles lose their irritability, while muscles frozen for a short time may regain their irritability upon thawing. The loss of irritability is more related to the freezing process itself rather than the temperature. Muscles once frozen eventually die sooner than those left untouched, indicating a partial exhaustion of their vital forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
