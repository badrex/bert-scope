Kemmer, Abdus Salam, and N. F. Mott, explore the possibility of an analytic continuation for the relativistic equation for two-nucleon scattering. They find that by taking advantage of a gap in the rest-mass spectrum, they can continue the integral equation and obtain an elliptic metric. This method allows for a better understanding of the behavior of the equation and helps in solving it numerically."}
