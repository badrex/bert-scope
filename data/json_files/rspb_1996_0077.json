The authors found that initial size differences and relative loss of mass between queens influenced survival, while the manipulation of queens' relative contribution to worker brood production did not significantly affect survival probability. The results suggest that workers may not be able to recognize and favor their mother queen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
