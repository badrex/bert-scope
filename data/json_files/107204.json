The author, George Gilpin, describes the setup and methods used to minimize errors in the measurements. The results show that the variation was generally stationary at around 7 or 8 am and 1 or 2 pm, with a mean monthly diurnal alteration of variation of 15 minutes. The author also discusses the influence of wind and atmospheric changes on the needle's stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
