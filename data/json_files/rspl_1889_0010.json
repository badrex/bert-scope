The author, John Hopkinson, uses a reliable balance and high-quality weights to conduct experiments and determine the atomic weight of iron. The study provides detailed information on the experiments performed on various iron samples, contributing to the understanding of iron's behavior at high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
