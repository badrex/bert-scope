They find that H-space is a 4-dimensional complex manifold with a complex Riemannian metric and demonstrate that its curvature is always self-dual. This research provides an alternative approach to understanding the asymptotic structure of space-time and has implications for the study of gravitational radiation and the geometry of space-time.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
