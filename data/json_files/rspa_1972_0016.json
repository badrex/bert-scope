They focused on understanding the critical conditions for coalesced drops to separate or remain united. The coalescence efficiency was measured as a function of drop size, relative velocity, and charges. The results were supported by a theoretical framework, with implications for meteorological and atmospheric science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
