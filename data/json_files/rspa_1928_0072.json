The adhesion and melting point of these mixtures were found to change with the molecular composition, and the structure of the crystalline plates also varied. The research suggests that the adhesion and melting point curves can be used to understand the interactions and phase behavior of these mixtures, which could have implications for the development of new lubricants and materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
