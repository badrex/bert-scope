They find evidence of pre-Last Glacial age glacigenic deposits and Last Glacial age fluviatile terrace and alluvial fan deposits. The authors also discover changes in vegetation from Wet Sclerophyll Eucalyptus forest to Temperate Rain Forest and back to Wet Sclerophyll Eucalyptus forest, which they attribute to climatic changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology and Quaternary Geology"}
