The study reveals that the raf kinase gene, lin-45, acts downstream of the ras gene during vulval induction. The research contributes to understanding the molecular pathways involved in cell signaling and organogenesis in C. elegans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
