He discovered various mechanisms in different insects, such as the Blue-bottle Fly and the Horse Fly, that help them attach to objects. He also noticed that some insects have elastic cushions on their feet to protect them from injury when landing suddenly. This research provides insights into the diverse adaptations of insects and their locomotion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Entomology"}
