They analyzed the available experimental data on the principal line series and associated photoionization continuum for each alkali metal atom, enabling them to estimate the oscillator strengths for the high series members. The results provide a better understanding of the absorption and photoionization processes in these elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
