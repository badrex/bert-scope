The authors debate the source of minerals, the process of silicification and calcification, and the environmental conditions required for permineralization. They also question the concept of 'evolutionary museums' and the evolutionary significance of plants in swamp environments. The authors call for more experimental approaches to test hypotheses and better understanding of the processes involved in permineralization.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
