The research showed that both the retina and the membranous labyrinth develop as protrusions from the brain, and they share similarities in their structure and development process. This study provides important insights into the anatomy and physiology of the nervous system and the sensory organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
