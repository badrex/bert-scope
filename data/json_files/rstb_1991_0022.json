It shows that the incoming olivary fibers are attracted to their terminal fields without passing through a random dispersion stage. The study also reveals that the biochemical heterogeneity of Purkinje cells disappears during the first postnatal week, which is when adult-like cerebellar maps are formed. The matching of region-specific chemical labels between incoming afferent fibers and heterogeneous sets of Purkinje cells is suggested as a mechanism for the formation of cerebellar maps.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
