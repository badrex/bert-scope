They found that the rate of combustion and the position of equilibrium varied with the final gas pressure. The results suggest that the cathodic combustion of carbonic oxide in moist mixtures occurs through two distinct ways, with pressure favoring one and disfavoring the other.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
