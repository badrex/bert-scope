He describes the effects of the earthquake, including the destruction of the town of Conception and the retreat of the sea, which left ships and rocks exposed. Caldcleugh also discusses the role of the barometer in predicting and measuring the earthquake's impact. He notes that the sea level rose 15 feet above its usual level in the island of Juan Fernandez, 360 miles away from the coast. This observation highlights the earthquake's significant influence on the Pacific Ocean and its surrounding areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
