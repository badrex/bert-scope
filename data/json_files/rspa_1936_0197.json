They found that the films had resistivities 10 times greater than the bulk metal, and their results were explained by a simple modification of J.J. Thomson's theory. The experiments provided reproducible results and helped explain the behavior of thin films in previous studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
