They found that carbon monoxide has a thermal conductivity of 0.00005633 and nitrous oxide has a thermal conductivity of 0.00003740. These findings are important for understanding the properties of gases and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Properties"}
