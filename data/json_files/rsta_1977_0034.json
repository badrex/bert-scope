The geocentric coordinates of the observatory are accurate to 1 m, and the Moon's three-dimensional coordinates and retroreflector locations are accurate to about 25 m. The study found a null value for the Nordtvedt term, supporting general relativity. The measurement of physical librations determined the moment of inertia parameters and gravitational harmonics. The post-fit residuals provide corrections to the Earth's rotation and U.T.O values, with accuracies of 0.5 ms (20 cm).", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
