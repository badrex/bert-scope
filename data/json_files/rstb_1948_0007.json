The authors describe the structure and dynamics of the halteres, explaining how their gyroscopic properties function as a sense organ. They also discuss the differences in structure and effectiveness of the halteres in various Diptera families.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Anatomy and Physiology"}
