The researchers found that specific agglutinins were first detected at 10 days of age in all groups of rats injected between birth and 4 days. Rats receiving injections at 16 days or later produced agglutinins as quickly as adults. The results suggest that the active immune response is of protective value even during the period of active absorption of maternal globulin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
