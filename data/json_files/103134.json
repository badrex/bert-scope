The island rose from the sea due to subterranean fires and earthquakes. It grew in height, length, and breadth over time, and its movement was visible and sometimes uneven. The surrounding sea also changed color and smelled bad, indicating the ongoing volcanic activity. This new island, along with other volcanic islands in the area, provide valuable insights into the geological processes of the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
