Researchers measured 10 skull characters on 300 specimens of C. suaveolens and 99 specimens of C. russula from various locations. The results show that the two species have distinct differences in skull size and shape, with C. russula being larger than C. suaveolens. The study also reveals that shrew populations from Sark and Jersey differ more from each other than any pair of Scilly Island populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
