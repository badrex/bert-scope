They used mass spectrometry and vapour-phase chromatography to analyze the products and found that the decomposition of diethyl ether is influenced by factors such as initial ether pressure, inhibition with nitric oxide, and the addition of hydrogen and carbon tetrafluoride. The main products of the reaction include acetaldehyde, ethane, carbon monoxide, methane, ethylene, hydrogen, and ethanol.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
