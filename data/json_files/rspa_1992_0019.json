The results show that solutions exist in the backwards or forwards direction in the space-time, depending on the sign of a constant related to the total Bondi mass of the metric. The findings also suggest that unique solutions exist in the Robinson-Trautman class, and smooth vacuum extensions may exist beyond the event horizon, except for the Schwarzschild metric.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
