They found that chemoreceptivity is essential for aggregating flies of both sexes in areas where food is available, allowing for sexual congress. The study also investigated the role of antennae in chemoreception and found that the pit organ is not essential for olfactory or humidity responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Behavior"}
