They argue that the presence of a 3He atom adsorbed on the surface of the ion can change the nucleation rate due to its interaction with the helium at the ion's surface and its ability to release energy during the nucleation process. The study suggests that the energy release can explain recent experimental results without the need for a significantly modified perturbation, but further experiments are needed to confirm the theory's predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
