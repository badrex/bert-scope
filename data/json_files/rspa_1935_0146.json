C. Titchmarsh, investigates the distribution of zeros of the Riemann zeta-function, a fundamental concept in number theory. He examines the calculations and methods used by previous authors, and presents new results and theoretical considerations. The study of the zeros of the zeta-function is crucial for understanding the distribution of prime numbers and testing the Riemann Hypothesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
