The authors found that after exercise, a recovery process occurs where the body uses extra oxygen to restore itself. The duration and intensity of the exercise affect the amount of oxygen needed for recovery. The research also discusses methods for measuring oxygen intake and carbon dioxide output during exercise and recovery.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Exercise Physiology"}
