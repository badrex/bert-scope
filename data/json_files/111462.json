They explored various sites, including the vicinity of the Obelisk of Heliopolis and the site of ancient Memphis. The research involved sinking pits and borings to discover the depth of sediment layers and analyze the composition of the soil. The author concluded that the alluvium consists of two main types, and the Nile sediment found at the lowest depth is similar in composition to that of the present day. The study also revealed the factors affecting the deposition of sediment in different parts of the valley and the rate of secular increase of the alluvial land.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
