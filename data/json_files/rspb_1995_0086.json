They find that sexual mixing patterns play a significant role in the spread of HIV, with seropositives being more likely to have mixed with the older, more heavily infected age group. The study also demonstrates the importance of considering sexual networks in predicting future transmission rates and developing effective prevention strategies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
