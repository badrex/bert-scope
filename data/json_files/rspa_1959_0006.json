They found that the reactions between the two compounds were competitive, meaning that the presence of one compound affected the rate of the other's reaction. This research provided insights into the behavior of organic compounds under radiation, which could have implications for various applications, such as radiation shielding and waste management.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
