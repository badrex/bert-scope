They develop a new approach to determine the kinetic energy release distribution directly, without trial and error methods. This method applies to cases with or without discrimination against product ions and can be used for various peak shapes and fragmentation reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
