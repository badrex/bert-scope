The results show that during high flow, endothelial cells from hypoxic rats release less ATP and more endothelin compared to normoxic rats. This suggests that under low oxygen conditions, a balance between ATP and endothelin release may regulate the response of vessels to shear stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vascular Biology"}
