They used 13C n.m.r. spectroscopy and chemical transformations to determine the structure and origin of the novel methyl groups in the chlorophylls. The study showed that the methyl groups are derived from methionine and provided evidence against previous proposals for the biosynthetic pathway. The findings contribute to the understanding of chlorophyll and porphyrin biosynthesis in photosynthetic bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
