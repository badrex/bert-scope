They explain the concept of vorticity and how it affects the interference velocities inside the wind tunnel. The theory is based on Prandtl's work, and the authors provide mathematical expressions and examples to illustrate the interference effects in different scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
