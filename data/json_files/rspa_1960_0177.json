The authors use an apparatus similar to Taylor's original design to test Chandrasekhar's theoretical calculations on the stability of the flow. They confirm Chandrasekhar's calculations and provide an asymptotic form of the stability relation when the cylinders rotate in opposite directions. The results show that the flow becomes unstable when the cylinders rotate in the same direction, while rotating in opposite directions stabilizes the flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
