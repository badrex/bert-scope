These trees, some reaching up to 36 yards in length, were buried due to the overflow of the fenlands caused by the muddiness of the tides. This discovery was confirmed by the historical accounts of Mr. Dugdale in his book on draining the fens in England.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoenvironment"}
