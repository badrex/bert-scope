The structure revealed that the triphosphate chain is in a folded conformation in each of the two crystallographically independent molecules. The adenine bases show considerable overlap and are stacked in the axis direction. The structure provides insights into the role of ATP as a prime energy source for most endergonic biological systems and its participation in various enzymatic reactions."}
