They develop equations to explain the adsorption of dyes in the presence of salt and determine the contribution of specific groups in the dye molecules to the free energy of adsorption. The study also explores the effect of temperature on ionic equilibria and the potential on the protein fiber.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
