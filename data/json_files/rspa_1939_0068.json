They found that larger bursts increased more rapidly with altitude than smaller bursts, indicating a change in the energy distribution of electrons. This suggests that there is a higher proportion of very energetic particles at higher altitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
