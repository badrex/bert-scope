The authors use a variational method to calculate the energies and widths of these resonant states and discuss their threshold behavior and decay mechanisms. They also analyze the nature of the wave functions and the probability of elastic and inelastic decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
