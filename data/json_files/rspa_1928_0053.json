They used various methods to measure the densities of the photographic plates and found that the intensity distribution followed a smooth curve. The results provided insights into the distribution of intensities among the lines of a band, which was essential for understanding the behavior of molecules and atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
