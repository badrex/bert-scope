They find that the solvent power of concentrated silver nitrate solutions increases with rising temperature, and that the solubility of silver chloride in these solutions is significantly higher than in dilute solutions. This study has implications for understanding the behavior of mixed solvents and the separation of compounds in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solubility and Chemical Reactions"}
