They explore the relationship between the thickness of the earth's crust and the observed amount of precession, considering factors such as temperature and pressure. The study also investigates the forms of isothermal surfaces within the earth, providing insights into the earth's interior mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
