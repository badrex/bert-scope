They observed the absorption spectra of NH and NH2 radicals and found a new complex absorption around 2700 A, which they attributed to the N3 radical. The mechanism of hydrogen azide photolysis was discussed, and an alternative reaction scheme was proposed, involving the formation of N3 as an intermediate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy and Chemical Bonding"}
