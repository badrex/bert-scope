Their measurements, which were supported by examining inter-level differences, were expressed to eight significant figures. The results provide a third determination in the region 3370 to 3755 A, as required by the International Astronomical Union for the use of these lines as secondary standards.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
