They find that under certain conditions, the internal friction is not altered by magnetisation stress, but when the stress is intermittent or reversed, the internal friction increases. The author also discovers that the increased effect on internal friction due to magnetic stress diminishes as the frequency of interruptions increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
