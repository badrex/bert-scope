They demonstrate that the Cartesian concept of a vortex cannot be mechanically generated due to the homogeneous and infinitely soft nature of matter, and that the vortex's formation and maintenance are not sufficient to explain the observed behavior of the heavens. The author calls for a reevaluation of the vortex theory and encourages further exploration of alternative explanations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
