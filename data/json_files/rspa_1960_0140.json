They find that the cis-trans isomerization occurs as a reversible, homogeneous, unimolecular reaction, while the structural isomerization is slower and yields various olefines. The authors use gas chromatography to analyze the reaction mixtures and determine the rate constants and equilibrium constants for the reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
