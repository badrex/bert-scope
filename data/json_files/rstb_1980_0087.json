The low-level process, also known as the short-range process, is responsible for the segregation of random-dot patterns and is vulnerable to interference from a bright uniform field. The high-level process, on the other hand, is more interpretive and determines the criterion of smooth perceived motion. The author presents evidence from various experiments to support the existence of these two processes and their interaction in visual perception.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
