They explore the properties of these vibrations in plane rings and molecules containing a plane ring of four or more atoms. The author derives the energy levels and wave functions of a one-dimensional oscillator with V(x) = ax^4 and discusses the thermodynamic implications of these vibrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
