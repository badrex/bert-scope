The authors propose that secondary emission should be considered as a change in the effective charge of an electron, and they analyze the consequences of this assumption. They discuss the relationship between the fluctuations and the measured fluctuations, as well as the impact of secondary emission at the grid and anode.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electronics"}
