The sailor exhibited symptoms such as disorientation, hallucinations, and violent convulsions. Through bloodletting, Oliver successfully treated the sailor, who eventually recovered. Calenture is caused by a sudden increase in body heat, which affects the animal spirits and leads to confusion and disordered functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Phrenitis Treatment"}
