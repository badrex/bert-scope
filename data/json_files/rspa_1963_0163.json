They concluded that the primary process for methane formation is the unimolecular dissociation of ethane, and the initiation of radical chains by this reaction is a first-order process under their experimental conditions. The overall ethane pyrolysis is accelerated by inert gases due to the acceleration of the unimolecular reaction. The authors also determined the activation energy associated with the dissociation of ethane and found it to be in excellent agreement with thermochemical estimates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
