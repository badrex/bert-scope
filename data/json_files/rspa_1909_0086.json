The author discusses the methods used to determine these constants and tests their accuracy by comparing computed and observed heights of water. The results provide a basis for predicting tides at these ports and understanding the tidal patterns in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
