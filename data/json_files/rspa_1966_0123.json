The protection occurs mainly through the indirect effect, where thiourea reacts with radiolytic products of water, such as radicals and hydrated electrons, preventing them from attacking the macromolecules. The study also showed that the presence of oxygen influences the radiolysis process and the formation of various decomposition products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Radiation Chemistry"}
