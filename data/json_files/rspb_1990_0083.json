They replaced cysteine residues with alanine and serine to study their role in the enzyme's catalytic mechanism. The results showed that the C42A and C47S mutants were unable to catalyze the reduction of glutathione by NADPH, indicating the importance of these residues in the enzyme's function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
