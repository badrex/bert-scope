They found a small error in the late observations made with the mural circle at Greenwich and pointed out a want of uniformity in the proper motions of stars, indicating a slow change in their positions. The author also explains the use of an artificial horizon of mercury for observations and notes that the mural circle became out of repair in 1821.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
