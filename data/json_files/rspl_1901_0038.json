They observe the formation of organs, muscles, and the heart, and discuss the origin of the maxillary and antennary glands. The study provides insights into the early stages of crustacean development and the role of different tissues in their growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Crustacean Biology"}
