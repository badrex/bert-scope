The authors found that the rate of solution and the adsorption isotherms can be described by mathematical equations, providing insight into the interaction between hydrogen and copper surfaces. The results have implications for understanding gas-solid interactions and the diffusion of gases in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
