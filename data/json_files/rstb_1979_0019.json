The Aldabra atoll has a diverse but small flora, making it an ideal location to study plant-pollinator interactions. The research found that while specialized pollinator-plant relationships are rare, generalist pollinators like beetles and birds play a significant role in the reproductive success of Aldabran plants. Beetles, specifically Mausoleopsis aldabrensis, were observed visiting 58% of the plant species observed in flower on Aldabra, making them efficient pollen transfer agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
