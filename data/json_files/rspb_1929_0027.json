It found that the untreated ovary undergoes compensatory hypertrophy, increasing its size and function to compensate for the sterilized ovary. This discovery provides insights into the mechanisms controlling follicular development and reproductive function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
