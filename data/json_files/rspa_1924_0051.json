They found that these disturbances are associated with a restricted area of solar disturbance rather than a periodic disturbed condition of the whole solar surface. The study covered the years 1921, 1922, and 1923, during which both low sunspot frequency and the latitude of spots contributed to the development of the 27-day period. The authors analyzed sunspot positions, magnetic character, and associated solar phenomena to understand the relationship between these disturbances and solar activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
