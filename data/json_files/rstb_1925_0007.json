The research aims to understand the invasion of the medium by cells from the original tissue fragment and the changes within the implant itself. The findings show that cell division occurs in adult alveolar epithelium, and many pulmonary elements are actively phagocytic.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
