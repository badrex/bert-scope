The research found that the respiratory quotient of the allantois is initially high but decreases as development progresses. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the large amounts of bound carbon dioxide in the yolk-sac during the last week of development and the challenges in determining the respiratory quotient accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
