The experiments aimed to check the theoretical predictions of the behavior and conditions of stability associated with unstable oscillation of tubular cantilevers conveying fluid. The results showed that damping may destabilize the system, and the observations agreed with the theoretical predictions. The study provides insights into the non-linear behavior of these systems and their structural stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Fluid Dynamics"}
