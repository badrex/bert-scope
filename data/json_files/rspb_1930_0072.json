They discovered a phenomenon called antagonism, where different wavelengths of X-rays neutralize each other's effects on living tissue. This finding has implications for understanding the selective action of X-rays and their potential use in radiation therapy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > X-ray Biology"}
