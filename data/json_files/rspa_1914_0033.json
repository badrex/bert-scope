They propose a theory that considers the complex nature of liquid water and how it affects the behavior of solutes in solution. The authors argue that the compression of a solution increases its internal vapour pressure, and they provide a mental picture to explain this phenomenon. They also explore the effects of temperature and pressure on osmotic pressure and discuss the limitations of current theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution Theory"}
