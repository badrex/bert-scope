The research focuses on understanding the effects of strain rate on the mechanical properties of polymers and the role of thermal properties in rapid deformation. The authors used high-speed photography and heat-sensitive film techniques to visualize and measure the deformation process. They found that the strain rate sensitivity of the polymers ranged from 5-15 MPa per decade of strain rate, with some polymers showing softening at higher strain rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Polymer Science"}
