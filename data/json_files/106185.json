He observed the needle's behavior in various locations, including on a hill and near the ocean, and recorded the changes in magnetic declination. His findings were aimed at providing accurate data to the Royal Society for further research and understanding of Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
