They use relativistic wavefunctions and the Dirac-Fock scheme to analyze ionization processes and explain the observed trends for the whole periodic table. The model demonstrates that the increase in ionization potentials with the degree of ionization is due to the change in the number of pair repulsions attending any ionization process, rather than changes in the properties of the orbitals themselves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
