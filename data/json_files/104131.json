T. Desaguliers conducted experiments to study the behavior of electricity and its interaction with non-electric bodies. He discovered that non-electric bodies, like water and some materials, can affect the state of electricity in electric bodies. Desaguliers also observed the role of dry and moist air in electrical experiments and how it influences the behavior of electric and non-electric bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
