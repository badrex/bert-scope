They found that the eye has a unique ommatidial structure with eight retinula cells forming a long column. In the dark-adapted eye, four retinula cell bodies reach the cone tip, while in the light-adapted eye, a crystalline tract up to 100 \u00b5m long is formed by extensions of the cone. The study provides insights into the relationships between different types of eyes found in higher insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
