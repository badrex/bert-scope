They find differences in their sensitivity to near-surface bulk (selvedge) and surface adsorbates, with UPS being more sensitive to selvedge levels and INS to surface monolayer levels. The study provides insights into the development of experimental tools for surface characterization.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Physics"}
