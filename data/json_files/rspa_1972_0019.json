They found that the process involves two distinct reactions: ligand exchange without change in oxidation state and oxidation by the halide. The authors used electron spin resonance (ESR) spectroscopy to determine the nature of the final oxidation state and followed the kinetics of its formation, providing a detailed understanding of the overall reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
