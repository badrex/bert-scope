They timed a glass ball as it passed through two horizontal planes, measuring the time intervals and distances between them. The results were then compared to the British Fundamental Gravity Station, providing a more accurate measurement of gravity. This method allowed for a more precise determination of forces and helped in realizing other fundamental constants in physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
