They compare the results with the Euler method and discuss the stability of the stationary points and Hopf bifurcation points. The alternative method they propose shows superior stability properties and converges to the attracting fixed point for certain initial conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical methods"}
