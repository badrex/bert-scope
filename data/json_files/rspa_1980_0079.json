They analyzed the profiles using computer techniques and found that the observed profiles were influenced by excitation mechanisms. The results showed that the Lorentzian width of one line, when extrapolated to zero density, exceeded the radiation width, which is in agreement with earlier workers. The authors also discussed possible experiments to overcome the difficulties encountered in their work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
