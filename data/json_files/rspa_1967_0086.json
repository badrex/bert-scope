The authors find that at low magnetic Reynolds numbers, the field lines uniformly penetrate the column without significant spiralling. However, at higher numbers, the field lines exhibit spiralling and a sort of funnelling effect, which may enhance the electrical conductivity of the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
