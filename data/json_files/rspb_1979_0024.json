The symbiosis is essential for legume growth and provides a unique habitat for Rhizobium bacteria. The article discusses the importance of host specificity, the role of plant lectins in infection, and the process of nodule formation and development. It also highlights the challenges in understanding the complex genetic interactions between the two partners and the potential implications for agriculture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
