An analytic solution is obtained, showing that lines of magnetic force reconnect to form closed loops during the transient phase. The behavior of the system is explored for all conductivities, and numerical examples and approximate expressions are provided for the limiting cases of large conductivity and small length scales.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
