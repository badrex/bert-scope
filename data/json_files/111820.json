He suggests that the sun has magnetic poles and that the Earth's magnetic axis may coincide with its axis of rotation. Langberg's hypothesis explains the observed changes in the Earth's magnetic field and the connection with the sun's position in its orbit, as well as the annual variation of the aurora borealis.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Magnetism and Solar-Terrestrial Relations"}
