The researchers found that significant amounts of protein-bound radioactivity were present in brain extracts, suggesting that the brain is permeated with protein derivatives from the fed material. This discovery challenges the traditional belief that proteins like IgG do not traverse the blood-brain barrier.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
