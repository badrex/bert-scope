The author explains how interstellar gas clouds collapse and form clusters of protostars, which can be detected as high-luminosity infrared objects. The article also explores the dynamics of these collapsing clouds, the resulting fragments, and the formation of disks around protostars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
