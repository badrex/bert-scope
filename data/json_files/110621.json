He conducts a series of experiments using silver as a basis to determine the equivalent numbers of chlorine and other elementary gases. Phillips concludes that the theory holds true with minimal error for hydrogen, oxygen, azote, and chlorine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
