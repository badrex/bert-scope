They analyzed the properties and electronic configurations of these states and discussed the possible interpretations of the band systems. Additionally, they found three new band systems ending on the lowest even triplet state 2s3 of H2, providing more insights into the hydrogen molecular spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
