By placing two glass plates with baric chloride and hydric sulfate solutions, the chemical reactions create repulsion lines that affect the growth of the reactions. This phenomenon demonstrates that chemical action can take place at a distance and that two or more chemical actions can completely exclude one another.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reaction and Kinetics"}
