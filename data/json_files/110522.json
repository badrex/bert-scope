He found that rooms heated through cast-iron pipes or stoves had poor air quality and caused health issues for occupants. In contrast, rooms heated using steam pipes maintained better air quality and had a positive impact on the health of workers. Ure also compared the efficiency of air ventilation using a fire and chimney versus a fan-ventilator, finding that the fan-ventilator was more effective.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Building engineering"}
