He also investigates the relationship between the lifting power of electro-magnets and their length, finding that their lifting powers are nearly inversely proportional to the square root of their lengths. Dr. Ritchie concludes that electro-magnetic power is unlikely to replace voltaic batteries for chemical decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
