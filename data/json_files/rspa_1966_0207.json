They found that the isotope effect has a maximum value for proton transfers between two acid-base systems of approximately equal strength, in agreement with theoretical predictions. The results suggest that the abstraction of a proton from nitroparaffins by hindered pyridine bases exhibits an abnormally high isotope effect, likely due to a considerable tunnelling correction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
