The formula is derived from dynamical principles and suggests that black body radiation is determined by the joint action of electrons and positive particles. The author also discusses the implications of this formula for atomic heat and the reconciliation of various laws in physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism and Quantum Mechanics"}
