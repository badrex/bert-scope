They used a rotating-film camera and a high-speed cathode-ray oscillograph to capture voltage and current oscillograms. The results showed that the development of the spark discharge is affected by the presence of capacitance and resistance in the circuit, and the speed of the leader stroke decreases as the pressure decreases. The authors also observed different types of discharges, such as positive and negative discharges, and the formation of leader strokes with various branching patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
