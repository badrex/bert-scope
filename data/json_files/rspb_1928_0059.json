This dual nature of cerebellar control supports the idea that the cerebellum plays a crucial role in coordinating muscle movements and maintaining balance. The findings challenge previous beliefs about cerebellar function and provide a better understanding of how the cerebellum controls muscle tone and postural stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
