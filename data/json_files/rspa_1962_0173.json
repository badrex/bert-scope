The authors found that a statistical time lag exists, which was previously overlooked in earlier studies. They developed a statistical theory to explain the time between the application of stress and the occurrence of a breakdown event. The study also highlights the importance of electrode conditions and the effect of air content on the breakdown process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
