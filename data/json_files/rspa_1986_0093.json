They derive necessary and sufficient conditions on the data for the reconstruction to be possible, and show that three spectra corresponding to different end conditions are required for the reconstruction of the beam's cross-sectional area and second moment of area.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
