They found that the vapour-density is normal up to about 750\u00b0C, after which dissociation becomes appreciable and gradually increases with rising temperature. At 1050\u00b0C, the density falls to 75.25. The study provides insights into the dissociation of bromine molecules at high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
