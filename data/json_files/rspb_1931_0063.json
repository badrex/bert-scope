The study focuses on the physical and chemical properties of the irradiation product, its behavior with digitonin, the presence of the hydroxyl group, molecular weight, double bonds, and stability. The author concludes that the vitamin D is an isomeride of ergosterol and contains a system of conjugated double bonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Steroids and Vitamins"}
