The study provides insight into the affinities of various forms and offers a comparison of early stages of development in different species. The author also discusses the factors involved in the process of stigmatogenesis and the importance of understanding the basis of this process in the study of Ascidian pharynx development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
