He observed the influence of various factors on the natural outflow of subterranean water through springs and rivers. Dickinson also experimented with a method to drain off water artificially, which could potentially affect the flow of rivers and springs. He concluded that the season of rainfall plays a significant role in the supply of these springs, and that artificial drainage could be possible.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
