It explores the importance of low-temperature storage for mammalian spermatozoa and the role of glycerol in protecting cells against damage at very low temperatures. The authors also highlight the variations in resistance to freezing among different species and the optimal conditions for freezing and revival of spermatozoa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
