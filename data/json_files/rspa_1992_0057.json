The plate is made of anisotropic elastic material that is inhomogeneous in the through-thickness direction and symmetric about the midplane. The transfer matrix method is used to obtain the solution, which is applicable to monoclinic inhomogeneous elliptical plates and laminated plates with piecewise constant properties through the thickness.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
