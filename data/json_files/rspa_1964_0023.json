They analyze the crystal field data and compare it with paramagnetic resonance data to determine the magnetic hyperfine constant and spin-orbit coupling. The results suggest that the values for free divalent ions are only about 1 to 2% greater than those for the atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
