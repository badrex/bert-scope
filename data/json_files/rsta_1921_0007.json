It introduces general theorems that apply to various cases, including the standard system, the general case, and a more general problem involving linear compounds. The paper focuses on improving values by linear compounding and finding the mean square of error to compare new values with old ones.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
