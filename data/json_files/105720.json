Murdoch, explains the rules and examples for limiting the cases in which the rays of refracted light can be reunited into a colorless pencil. The study involves the use of refracting media and the manipulation of angles and thickness to control the colors and the spectrum of the light. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of light and its applications in optics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
