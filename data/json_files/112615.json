They provide two general theorems that form the basis of statics and can be transformed into fundamental theorems of mechanics. The author also discusses the representation of complexes of forces and rotations using coordinates and equations, and how these concepts can be applied to various scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
