It focuses on the transport of reactive solutes in heterogeneous formations, considering nonlinear equilibrium sorption and mineral dissolution. The study also analyzes the problem of immiscible displacement of a non-wetting fluid by a wetting fluid, such as oil displacement by water. The authors provide a conceptual framework for understanding and modeling these processes, which are important in geochemistry, reservoir engineering, and subsurface contaminant hydrology.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
