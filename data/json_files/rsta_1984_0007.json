They find that process-independent chemical characteristics, such as the abundance ratios of certain elements, can help differentiate between magma sources from various tectonic environments. This research is crucial for understanding the composition of Earth's upper mantle and crust and their role in magma generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Geochemistry"}
