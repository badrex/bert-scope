They found that the presence of light materials, such as stone, over the lead absorber significantly reduces the number of showers and alters the shape of the transition curve. The study concludes that the presence of dense light material over the apparatus influences the number of showers and the shape of the transition curve in three main ways: density transition, atomic number transition, and filtration effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
