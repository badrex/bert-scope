They discuss the resistance of air and its effect on the motion of a mill, confirming that the forces are not due to radiation but rather the friction of the air. The author also investigates the relationship between the force causing motion and the resistance, concluding that they follow the same law as the resistance of air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
