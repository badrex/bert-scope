They explore the relationship between the vortex's size, translatory velocity, and energy, and consider the differences between solid and hollow vortex rings. The study also examines the time of vibration for crimped cross sections and pulsating hollows, with the hope of further investigating these cases in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
