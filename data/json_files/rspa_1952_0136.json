They conducted extensive diffraction measurements on various shrinkage stages of a haemoglobin crystal and applied a new principle to outline nodes and loops in the molecule's transform. This research provided insights into the overall dimensions and shape of the haemoglobin molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
