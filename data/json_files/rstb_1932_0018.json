They describe the structure and role of the maxillules, maxillae, and lower lips in the feeding mechanism of various Branchiopoda species. They also compare the differences in mouth parts between Branchiopoda and Malacostraca, and discuss the possible evolutionary relationships between the two groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
