The authors conducted experiments with various substances, such as benzene, acetic acid, and water, and found that the vapour-pressure of the solid is less than that of the liquid at the same temperature. This relation was first advanced by Professor James Thomson, and the authors also describe a new method for determining the vapour-pressures of solids and liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical thermodynamics"}
