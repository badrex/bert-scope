The author explores the balance's motion, the role of the spiral spring, and the weight of the balance. The article also discusses the center of gyration and its determination, as well as the calculation of the time of vibration for different balance configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
