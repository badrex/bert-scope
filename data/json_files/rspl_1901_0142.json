They found that chlorophyll does not remain unchanged in the excrements of herbivores, debunking a common statement in physiological chemistry. This study provides insights into the digestion and metabolism of chlorophyll in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
