They observed the radiation-induced oxidation of -phenylenediamine to Wurster's Blue cation and concluded that methoxy radicals were responsible for the oxidation. The mechanisms of radiolytic oxidation of iodide and thiocyanate ions in aqueous solutions were also investigated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
