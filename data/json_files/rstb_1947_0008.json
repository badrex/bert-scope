They discovered a well-developed late-glacial succession and found that the Windermere profile carried the story back into the late-glacial period. The study helps to fit this region into the general picture of the Quaternary history of the British Isles and offers a possibility of applying a geochronological time-scale.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
