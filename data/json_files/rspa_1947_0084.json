They derive important theorems related to pressure exerted by sound waves and examine the process of establishing the phenomenon during the setting up of a sound field in a special case. The study provides insights into the behavior of sound waves and their pressure in various scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
