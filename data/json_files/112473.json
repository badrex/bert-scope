They discovered that the stomach muscles have a complex arrangement of spiral fibers that form loops and intersect each other. This arrangement helps in the proper functioning of the stomach and its connection with the esophagus and the small intestine. The study also highlights the differences in muscle thickness and arrangement in different parts of the stomach and the role of these muscles in digestion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
