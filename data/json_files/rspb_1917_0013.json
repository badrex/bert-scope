They discovered that the persistence of the corpus luteum spurium over a considerable period in dogs is associated with uterine and mammary development, similar to what occurs in pseudo-pregnant rabbits and marsupial cats. This research provides insights into the hormonal regulation of reproductive cycles in dogs and other mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
