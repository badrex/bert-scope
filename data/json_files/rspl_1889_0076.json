The authors found that training walls can lead to accretion behind them, which can cause deterioration in the channel below. They also discovered that training walls in the lower estuary can create a more direct and uniform channel with increased depth.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Management"}
