They describe the instruments and methods used for photography and discuss the challenges of measuring the positions and wavelengths of lines in the spectra. The study focuses on the flame spectra of various metals and compounds, with a particular emphasis on the oxy-hydrogen flame.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
