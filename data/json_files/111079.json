The paper discusses various classes of equations, each with its unique transformation process, and demonstrates how these methods can be applied to a wide range of equations with integer and non-integer functions of x. The author also highlights the interchangeability of symbols D and x in the equations and their solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus and Analysis"}
