This method uses a conservative finite difference formulation and is relatively easy to implement, making it suitable for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional problems. The numerical method is compared with previous approaches and tested for shock propagation in channels and converging cylindrical and spherical shocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
