They found that the ore contains anhydrous carbonate of copper, which is different from malachite and the blue carbonate. The ore has a dark blackish-brown color, soft texture, and a small-conchoidal fracture. The analysis provides evidence that the copper is in the state of black oxide, and the ore can be distinguished by its anhydrous nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
