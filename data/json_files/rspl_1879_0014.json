The sphygmophone consists of a sphygmograph connected to a microphone and a battery, producing distinct sounds corresponding to the systolic push, arterial recoil, and valvular check of the pulse. This invention aids in teaching and illustrating pulse movements to students and medical professionals.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Instrumentation"}
