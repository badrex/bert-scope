They found that the inter-metallic compounds formed by aluminium and transition metals can be considered electron compounds, with transitional metal atoms absorbing electrons. The study confirms previous suggestions that the theory of transition metals in aluminium alloys can be used to predict the forms of complex equilibrium diagrams.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
