The authors analyze the stress orientations and magnitudes from various boreholes to understand the stress field and its implications for the lithosphere. The study provides insights into the regional stress patterns and helps in understanding the tectonic events that have shaped the European continent.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
