The author finds that acidity remains constant during maintained muscle contractions and decreases when the tension falls. The results suggest that acidity is common to both tetanus and tone, indicating that there is one mechanism in muscle and not two.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
