The authors estimate the deep lunar temperature to be between 1500-1600 K and discuss the implications of these findings for the Moon's thermal state and geophysical data. The study provides insights into the role of solid state convection in regulating the Moon's internal temperature and its potential impact on the lunar core.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
