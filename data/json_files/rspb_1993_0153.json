Results show that action potential propagation in myelin-deficient rats is slower, but still secure, with refractory and frequency-following properties similar to control myelinated axons. The study also finds that sodium channel density per axon is equivalent in both myelin-deficient and control optic nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
