They argue that the agreement between the observed and calculated potential difference does not support the theory of Donnan Equilibrium, as it is a necessary consequence of any mechanism that respects the Second Law of Thermodynamics. The author suggests that the potential difference is solely due to the contact of dissimilar solutions across a boundary, and that the system is in equilibrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
