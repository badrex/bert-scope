They study the interaction of ozone with silver surfaces and active nitrogen with copper oxide surfaces, measuring the number of molecular collisions required to achieve a chemical change. The results show that one collision with a silver surface is enough to destroy an ozone molecule, while an active nitrogen molecule must collide 500 times with an oxidized copper surface before being destroyed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
