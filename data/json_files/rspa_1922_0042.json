They found that the occluded hydrogen is not in the free atomic state, and the existence of molecular hydrogen in gaseous or liquid state would imply a smaller specific susceptibility for the active palladium. This study helps to understand the nature of the complex process of occlusion in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
