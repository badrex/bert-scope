They express the thermodynamic functions and equation of state of these mixtures in terms of intermolecular forces and properties of one pure component. The study compares the derived excess thermodynamic functions with experimental results on various solutions, improving the agreement by considering orientational forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
