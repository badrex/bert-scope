They found that when dogs are fed milk, their pancreas secretes lactase, a ferment that breaks down milk sugar. This indicates that the pancreas can modify its secretion based on the food it receives, suggesting that the adaptation is due to a chemical stimulus rather than a nervous mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
