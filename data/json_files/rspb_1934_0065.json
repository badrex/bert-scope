They found that insects primarily lose water through their spiracles, and that the rate of water loss increases when the spiracles are open. The author also discovered that the water loss is affected by the composition of the air surrounding the insect, with certain gas mixtures causing insects to keep their spiracles permanently open.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
