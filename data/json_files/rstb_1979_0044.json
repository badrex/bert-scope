They found that inorganic mercury rapidly transforms into 'bound' or 'non-reactive' mercury and that 25% of the mercury added was recovered associated with the organic material settling to the bottom of the bags. The results indicated that the levels of mercury found in surface waters around the coast of the U.K. were one or two orders of magnitude below the levels at which a response of the biological population could be demonstrated. The usefulness of large-scale enclosed ecosystems for further pollution research is discussed, focusing on the need for facilities that provide a link between the water column and the sediments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
