The authors study specific cases of radio propagation and analyze the effect of varying parameters such as angle of incidence, frequency, and direction of the Earth's magnetic field on the coupling points. The results have implications for understanding the amplitude and polarization of waves reflected from the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
