The author investigates the arrangement of organs and systems within the mollusk archetype, discussing the differences between prosobranchiate and opisthobranchiate mollusks and the role of asymmetrical development in their evolution. The study also highlights the unique features of the dentigerous \"tongue\" and the locomotive apparatus in various mollusk species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
