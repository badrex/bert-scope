This calculus is rare and has unique properties, such as being more compact and semitransparent than other calculi. It is dissolved by various acids and alkaline substances. The author also notes that the solution formed with nitric acid does not yield oxalic acid, which is a distinguishing characteristic of this new species.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemistry of Urine"}
