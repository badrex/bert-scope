The authors argue that it should be placed in a family of its own, the Dipteridinse, due to differences in its sporangia, fronds, and vascular tissue compared to the Polypodiacese. The authors also explore the geological history of Dipteris, tracing its origins to the Mesozoic period and noting its similarities to other fossil ferns found in various regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
