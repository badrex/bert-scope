They also identified the positions of water molecules in the crystal structure and discussed the molecular arrangement and disorder in the air-dried crystals. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of vitamin B12, which is essential for various biological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
