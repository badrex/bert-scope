They found that X-rays selectively affect metabolic processes, causing inhibition of tissue respiration and anaerobic glycolysis. The results suggest that differences in metabolism may account for the variability in response to radiation among different tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
