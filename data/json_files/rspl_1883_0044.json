The collection aims to include series of daguerreotypes and photographs of celestial objects taken by European and American astronomers. The author also suggests that duplicates or occasional negatives can be contributed to the collection to showcase recent improvements or phenomena. In cases where negatives cannot be provided, glass positives, photographic prints, or engravings would be useful.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophotography"}
