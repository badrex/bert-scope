He discovered that amber and diamonds emit light when rubbed, and that this light is most visible when the sun is near the horizon. This phenomenon led Dr. Wall to consider these materials as natural phosphors or noctilucas. His findings could help identify and distinguish genuine diamonds from other materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
