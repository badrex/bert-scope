They explain how epidermal cells can differentiate into various elements of the insect's body pattern and how hormonal regulation, particularly the presence or absence of juvenile hormone, influences the type of cuticle produced. This understanding of metamorphosis and cellular differentiation has implications for studying the development and evolution of insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
