It explains the processes of drop formation, release, and motion before impact with the blades. The author suggests ways to reduce erosion damage, such as designing blades with better aerodynamics and reducing the surface area of stationary nozzles.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
