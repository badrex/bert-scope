They use a quadratic force field with 26 non-zero constants and introduce four dipole moment derivative parameters and ten polarizability parameters to provide satisfactory indications of infra-red absorption intensities and Raman shift intensities. The study aims to reproduce the observed vibration frequencies of benzene and its deuterated derivatives to within 2% using a quadratic force field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
