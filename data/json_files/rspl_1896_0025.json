They found that the tenacity and ductility of gold are influenced by the presence of elements with smaller or larger atomic volumes than gold itself. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the structure and molecular composition of metals and alloys for better mechanical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallography"}
