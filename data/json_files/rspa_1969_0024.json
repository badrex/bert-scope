They determined that the 0-0 band is a type band, and the 1-0 band is a type band. The excited state rotational constants for the electronic state were calculated, and the results support the assumption of a planar excited state. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and electronic transitions of benzothiadiazole.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
