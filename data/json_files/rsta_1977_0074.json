They found that the excitation functions show marked characteristics leading to variations in proton-induced xenon ratios as a function of energy. The results help explain the complex cosmogenic xenon component in lunar samples and provide insights into the Moon's history and formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
