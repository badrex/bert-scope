He collaborated with T.J.I'A. Young on the book \"Algebra of Invariants,\" which introduced British mathematicians to the work of Clebsch and Gordan. Grace also made significant contributions to analytic geometry and the theory of numbers. Despite his remarkable abilities, Grace's personal struggles and unstable lifestyle prevented him from reaching his full potential in the field of mathematics."}
