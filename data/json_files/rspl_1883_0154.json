They discovered that the vapour-pressure of a solid is less than that of a liquid at the same temperature, and this difference can be calculated from thermic data. The new method of determining vapour-pressures of solids and liquids offers significant advantages and is applicable to various chemical types.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
