The researchers found that these neurons have small fusiform cell bodies located around the border between laminae I and II. They also discovered that these neurons have a powerful inhibitory input from cutaneous mechanoreceptors and respond only to noxious stimulation. These cells form part of the population of small, selectively nociceptive, neurons in the superficial dorsal horn and show a variety of morphological types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
