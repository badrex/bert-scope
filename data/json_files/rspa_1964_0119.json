They discovered two types of diamond, type I and type II, and found a strain pattern related to their distribution. The study also revealed that the diamond grew in layers, with solution and regrowth mechanisms playing a significant role in its formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
