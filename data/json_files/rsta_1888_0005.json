The author concludes that no method can achieve an accuracy of 1% or better, and that the wet-and-dry-bulb method is the most accurate when an artificial circulation of air is maintained. The study also highlights the limitations and uncertainties of the hair hygrometer and provides a detailed analysis of the differences between the methods in terms of their results and the information they provide.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
