They proposed a scheme for the positions and types of critical points in these materials, which helped interpret infra-red absorption and Raman scattering spectra. This analysis provided more accurate phonon frequencies at specific symmetry points in the Brillouin zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
