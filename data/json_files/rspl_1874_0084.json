They focused on carbonic acid gas and its behavior under different pressures and temperatures. The author discovered that the gas laws, such as Boyle's and Gay-Lussac's laws, are only true in certain conditions and fail in others. The results suggest that critical points of many gases are likely far below the lowest temperatures attained so far.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
