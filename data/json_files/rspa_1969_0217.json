They found that the general flow pattern for elastico-viscous liquids is similar to that for Newtonian liquids, consisting of two spirals separated by the central plane. Elasticity has a significant effect on the pitch of these spirals, enhancing the flow rate in the laminar flow and transition region but reducing it in turbulent flow at high Reynolds numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
