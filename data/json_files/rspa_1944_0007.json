They observed that the bacteria formed snake-like structures under specific conditions and proposed a theory of balance and adaptive variation of enzyme processes in bacteria. The authors also discussed the mechanism of this adaptation using a hypothesis involving enzyme synthesis and crystal growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
