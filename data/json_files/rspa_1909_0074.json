The authors found that gold leaf becomes transparent when heated in contact with glass. They discovered that gold leaf contracts at a certain temperature, which is independent of the tension in the leaf. This contraction explains the increase in transparency when gold leaf is heated on glass. The authors also propose a possible explanation for this phenomenon based on surface tension and rigidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
