They investigated the contact potential differences using the contact-potential method and discussed the importance of experimental conditions for accurate measurements. The study provides insights into the adsorption of gases and the mechanism of chemical reactivity at such surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
