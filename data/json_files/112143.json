One design consists of a plane mirror with two small reflectors, while the other features a glass plate with silvered edges. These heliotropes produce cones of sunlight without requiring any movable parts, making them easier to use and more efficient for surveying purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Surveying Techniques"}
