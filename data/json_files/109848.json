Todd conducted experiments on the Torpedo of the Cape of Good Hope to study its electric discharge and its effects on the animal's vitality. He found that the electric discharge is a vital action and that frequent action can be injurious to the animal's life. Animals without the ability to give electric shocks were more vivacious and lived longer. The experiments also showed that both electric organs and all nerves in the organs are not necessary for the shock, and that there is a close relationship between the nervous system and electric organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
