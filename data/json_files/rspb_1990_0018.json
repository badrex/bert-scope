The authors demonstrate that segregation can be affected by factors other than the supposed texton features, such as global luminance contrast and differences in spatial frequency composition. They suggest that these factors may play a crucial role in the perception of texture borders and the segregation of texture areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
