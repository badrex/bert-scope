They find that the liquid flow is drawn towards the axis, and the motion becomes increasingly violent near the sphere. The solution represents the liquid's motion for a limited time due to the increasing velocity of the liquid. The authors also mention ongoing work to find a more comprehensive solution to the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
