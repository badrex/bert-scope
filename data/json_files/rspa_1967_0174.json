These coefficients are essential for determining the baryon 'current' coupled to the lowest state of a meson tower in particle physics. The authors also explore the asymptotic behavior of the coefficients and prove orthogonality and completeness relations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
