P. Gassiot, conducted experiments to study the effect of magnetic force on the voltaic discharge in vacuo. He discovered that the luminous discharge from a battery could be interrupted or entirely arrested by magnetic force, providing evidence that a voltaic discharge can be disrupted by magnetic force.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
