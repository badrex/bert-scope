The author corrects a mistake in the original paper, stating that the complete elastodynamic field cannot be found using half-range Fourier sine series alone. Instead, a half-range cosine series must also be added to satisfy the equations of motion and Hooke's law in the interior of the wedge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave mechanics"}
