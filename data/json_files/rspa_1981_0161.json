The authors extend previous work on fluids of grades 2 and 3 and apply the Dunn-Fosdick postulate to fluids of complexity. They analyze the behavior of these fluids in slow motions and isochoric slow motions, concluding that the rest state of fluids of complexity is conditionally stable if certain conditions are met. This study contributes to the understanding of fluid mechanics and the behavior of complex fluids in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics > Fluid Dynamics"}
