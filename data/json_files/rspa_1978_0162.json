The authors analyze the absorption band profiles and compare them with a theory connecting the profiles to exciton-phonon coupling. They evaluate the parameters and refine the theory to extend its application to experimentally measured spectral moments. The results are compared with experimental data, providing insights into the behavior of excitons in molecular crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
