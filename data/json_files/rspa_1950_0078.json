The researchers found that the effective rotational temperatures for various flames were higher than the calculated values, indicating that the C2 molecules' distribution of rotational energy follows a Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution. This discovery provides insights into the combustion processes and the formation of excited radicals in flames.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
