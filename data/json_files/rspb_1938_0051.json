{"article_id": "rspb_1938_0051", "revised_title": "Carbon Dioxide Distribution in Hen's Eggs", "semantic_tags": ["Biochemistry", "Egg Biology", "Carbon Dioxide", "Egg White Composition", "Buffer Systems"], "tldr": "The authors studied the distribution of carbon dioxide in hen's eggs and found that the bicarbonate content of egg-white increases with higher partial pressures of carbon dioxide. They also determined the solubility of carbon dioxide in egg-white and discussed the buffering capacity of egg-white. This research provides insights into the composition and properties of egg-white, which can be useful for understanding egg biology and food science.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
