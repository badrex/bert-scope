They used a photoelectric electron multiplier tube coupled to a cathode ray oscillograph to measure light emission and found that the after-glow in hydrogen is likely due to thermal effects, while in argon, it is caused by other factors, such as the persistence of atoms in metastable states. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of light emission from spark channels and the role of thermal processes in these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
