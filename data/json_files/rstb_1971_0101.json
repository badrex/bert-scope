The research identifies the specialized contacts between cone pedicles and bipolar, horizontal, and other cell processes. The findings provide insights into the structure and function of cone cell synapses in the turtle retina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience > Retinal neuroscience"}
