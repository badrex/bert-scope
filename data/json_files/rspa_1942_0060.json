They obtained a stress-strain curve for the atomic lattice, which showed three distinct phases of lattice behavior: expansion before yield, a permanent contraction at the yield point, and a consistent increase in permanent contraction with increasing stress. These findings provide insights into the mechanics of metallic lattices and their deformation under stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
