The author discusses the role of self-attraction, adhesion, shape, medium, and gravitation in drop formation and presents a series of experiments to study these factors. The findings show that the size of drops is affected by the growth-time and the rate of dropping, with a minimum drop weight occurring between specific growth-time intervals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
