It highlights the importance of understanding the routes taken by pollutants to assess the damage they can cause and develop effective control methods. The authors propose a broad classification of pollutants based on local, regional, or global scales, associated with the terrestrial boundary layer, the troposphere, and the stratosphere, respectively.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
