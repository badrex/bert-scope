The author found that these electrolytes produce varying effects on the demarcation source, which can be explained by a simple concentration law. The study is important for understanding the behavior of nerve cells and the impact of electrolyte concentrations on their function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
