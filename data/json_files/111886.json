He found that when a ring of mercury was covered with crispations, a musical sound was produced. The loudness of the sound depended on the power of the battery, and the phenomenon could be reproduced by reversing the direction of the electric current. Gore was investigating the conditions and relations of this phenomenon and planned to submit a complete account to the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
