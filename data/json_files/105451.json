He found that salt water provides more buoyancy to the cork than fresh water. The experiments also showed that the absorption of water by the cork changes its buoyancy, and the author suggests that the assertion that human bodies are specifically lighter than their respective volumes of water may not be entirely accurate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
