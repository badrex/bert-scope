They found that as the temperature increased, the range of frequencies the muscle could perform oscillatory work also increased. The results have implications for understanding the temperature dependence of insect flight and the matching of physical and physiological properties in the flight system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
