They classify the possible solutions based on the directional ellipse associated with a bivector and find that different choices of the ellipse lead to various combinations of static and propagating exponential solutions. The study is relevant to materials with electrical and magnetic anisotropy, which have applications in various fields such as microwave technology, liquid crystals, and high-temperature superconductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
