The research considers the changes in the argument of perigee due to atmospheric drag in an oblate atmosphere with a day-to-night density variation. The findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding the effects of these factors on satellite orbits and can help improve the accuracy of predicting upper-atmosphere densities, winds, and density scale heights.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
