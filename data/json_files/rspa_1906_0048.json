They also discovered that this variety is radioactive and contains helium. The authors concluded that the Galle variety of thorianite should not be considered a new mineral species due to the natural variation in the proportions of thorium and uranium oxides in minerals found in different localities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
