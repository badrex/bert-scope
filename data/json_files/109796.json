He discovered that these substances have unique properties that affect the polarization of light, and he observed new phenomena like elliptical colored rings produced by oblique depolarizing crystals. Brewster also found that certain angles, now known as Brewster's angle, cause light to be refracted without being polarized.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
