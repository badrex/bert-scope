The authors describe the isolation and characterization of temperature-sensitive yeast mutants blocked at specific stages in the assembly of the lipid-linked oligosaccharide. They also use these mutants to clone the genes for the enzymes in this pathway. Additionally, the article examines the topography of asparagine-linked oligosaccharide assembly and the transmembrane movement of sugar residues during glycoprotein synthesis. Finally, experiments on the control of the second stage of glycosylation are presented.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
