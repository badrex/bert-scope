{"article_id": "106250", "revised_title": "Assessing the Degrees and Quantities of Winds for Heavy Wind Machines", "semantic_tags": ["Wind power", "Wind machines", "Wind energy", "Meteorology", "Coal mining"], "tldr": "The author, John Stedman, investigates the degrees and quantities of winds necessary to move heavier wind machines, specifically for coal mining. He found that wind machines can be kept in motion for approximately 53 hours per week, and that the periods of the year with the highest rainfall also have the strongest winds. Stedman suggests that this information could be useful for estimating the risks of nautical adventures and insurance calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Wind Energy"}
