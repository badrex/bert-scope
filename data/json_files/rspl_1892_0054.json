They found that secondary and tertiary nitrites are more powerful than their primary counterparts due to their greater chemical instability and ease of decomposition. The research has important implications for the therapeutic use of nitrites in medicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
