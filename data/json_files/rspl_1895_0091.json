They found that nerve-fibres producing spleen contraction have a cell station in the prevertebral ganglia. The study also showed that nicotine can temporarily or completely block the effects of stimulating the nerve-roots and splanchnics, suggesting a cell station in the semilunar ganglion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
