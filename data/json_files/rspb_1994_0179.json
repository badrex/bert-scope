Nest defense against predators, the primary form of paternal care in this population, was less vigorous when nests contained offspring sired by extra-pair males. The results indicate that females must gain significant improvements in offspring fitness to compensate for the cost of extra-pair fertilizations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
