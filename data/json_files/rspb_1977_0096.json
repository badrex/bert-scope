They found that replacing the Gly2 residue with D-Ala in the enkephalins increased their stability and potency. The most active peptide, [D-Ala2, d-Leu5]-enkephalin, demonstrated the importance of stereochemical acceptability at specific positions in the peptide structure. The study highlights the role of metabolic and conformational factors in the opioid activity of enkephalin analogues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
