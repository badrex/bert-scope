The author focuses on homomorphic, gametophytic self-incompatibility systems and their implications for pollen-tube growth and pistil function. The review also explores recent hypotheses on the operation of gametophytic systems and their potential relevance to broader biological contexts, such as cell communication and animal-cell interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
