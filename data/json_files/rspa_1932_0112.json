Chadwick, discovered the neutron through experiments involving the bombardment of light elements with alpha particles. The radiation emitted from these interactions showed peculiarities, such as the ability to eject protons from hydrogen-containing materials. Chadwick proposed that these radiations were not quantum radiation but rather particles with mass nearly equal to that of protons and no net charge, which he called \"neutrons.\" This discovery led to a better understanding of nuclear reactions and the role of neutrons in atomic processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
