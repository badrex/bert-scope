The findings reveal that these concentrations are in excess of those expected from thermodynamic equilibrium, especially at lower temperatures. The research also discusses the mechanisms responsible for the ultimate equilibration of these excess radical concentrations in hydrogen flame gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
