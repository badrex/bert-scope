It shows that the increase in ventilatory capacity is mainly due to a reduction in lung gas density. The research also describes an oxygen mask designed for climbers, which has a lower flow resistance compared to a low-resistance apparatus for measuring maximum voluntary ventilation.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Respiratory Medicine"}
