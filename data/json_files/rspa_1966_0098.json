They found that the stacking sequences of carbon hexagon layers in these compounds can be generated from the stacking in normal graphite. When cooled through a specific temperature, increased ordering appears in the low-temperature structures, and each intercalate layer exhibits two-dimensional long-range order. This research provides insights into the molecular packing and structural changes in graphite nitrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
