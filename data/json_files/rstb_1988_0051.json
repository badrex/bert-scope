The author explains the importance of using restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) as markers to locate disease loci and refine the map at the molecular level to identify the affected gene. The author also highlights the significance of understanding the organization of the human genome, focusing on non-coding sequences, coding sequences, and simple-sequence DNAs, to efficiently build a molecular map for gene localization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
