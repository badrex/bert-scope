The authors studied various doubly charged ions, such as N2+, C2+, and A2+, and found that the cross-sections for partial charge transfer are large and slowly varying for certain energy ranges. The results confirm Bates and Massey's prediction that the cross-section may be large when the energy difference between initial and final potential energy curves is somewhat in excess of 2 eV. The authors also discuss the limitations of their experimental setup and plan to continue their measurements using different ion sources to study exclusively endothermic and slightly exothermic reactions."}
