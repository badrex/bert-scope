The authors observed cool flames in the oxidation of both hydrocarbons, with ethylbenzene producing a blue flame at higher temperatures. The results show that the processes allowing cool-flame formation in aromatic compounds are secondary in nature, and the oxidation mechanisms differ from those of paraffin hydrocarbons. The authors conclude that a change in reaction mechanism occurs above 300\u00b0C in ethylbenzene oxidation, possibly due to the breakdown of unstable oxygenated intermediates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
