They find that the partition function for a system of polymers of finite stiffness in an elongational flow is related to the joint law of a Brownian motion and a Brownian bridge. The authors also discuss the coil stretch transition, where the flow becomes so strong that the polymer undergoes an unbounded stretch.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Stochastic Analysis"}
