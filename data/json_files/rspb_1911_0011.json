Small doses cause a fall in blood pressure and an increase in respiration depth, while larger doses can lead to respiratory paralysis. The author also discovered that boxwood has no direct cardiac action and affects autonomic nerve cells, leading to vasoconstriction and increased reflex activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Pharmacology"}
