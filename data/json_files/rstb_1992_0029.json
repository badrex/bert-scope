The availability of mycorrhizal inoculum and seedling response to infection were examined in undisturbed and logged forest areas. Results show that spores of vesicular arbuscular (VA) mycorrhizal fungi were reduced by 25% after selective logging and by 75% after heavy logging. The study highlights the importance of root and hyphal fragments as inoculum in disturbed forests and suggests that living roots and hyphae are likely sources of infection in undisturbed forests.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
