The authors measured the velocity of ultrasonic waves in a series of organic vapors at different frequencies, temperatures, and pressures. They found ultrasonic dispersion in benzene, cyclopropane, and ethane but not in other tested vapors. The results suggest that small or rigid molecules with limited internal rotations or vibrations are more likely to exhibit ultrasonic dispersion. The study also discusses the persistence of vibrational energy and its role in gas reactions and combustion theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
