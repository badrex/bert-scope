The lamp uses a closed system that prevents the ignition of inflammable air in the mine, ensuring safety for miners. The lamp can be used in coal mines, powder magazines, and gunpowder manufacturing sites.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mining and Mineral Resources"}
