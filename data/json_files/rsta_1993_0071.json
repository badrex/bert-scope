It highlights the need for a more rigorous calibration of climatic controls on sedimentation to improve the interpretation of the geological record of climate change. The authors emphasize the need for a critical examination of proxy indicators of paleoclimate to enhance their calibration with climate, which will ultimately improve climate modeling and our understanding of Earth's past climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Sedimentology and Stratigraphy"}
