They find that ecosystems with unstructured cooperative interactions can be less stable than previously determined, while hierarchical ecosystems exhibit increased stability under certain conditions. The research provides a broader understanding of ecosystem stability and its implications for various fields, including ecology, sociology, and distributed computation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
