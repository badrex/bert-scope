They discovered that chloride of iodine directly combines with these organic radicals, forming new iodo-organic compounds. These compounds are colorless oils with a sweet and biting taste, and they are insoluble in water. The reactions involve addition and double decomposition processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
