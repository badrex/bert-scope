They identified three systems in the spectrum and discussed the differences between their findings and previous research by Butkow. The study also explored the tin isotope effect and its impact on the observed band structures. The authors concluded that the absorption spectrum of stannous sulphide is complex, with multiple overlapping progressions of bands, and that further research is needed to fully understand the underlying mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
