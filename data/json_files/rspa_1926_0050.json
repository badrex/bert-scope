H. Fowler and D. R. Hartree, analyze the spectrum of ionized oxygen (O II) and correlate the observed terms with the theoretical terms based on the Heisenberg-Hund theory of complex spectra. The study provides a satisfactory agreement between the observed and theoretical terms, demonstrating the significance of the correlation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
