The reflecting cuticle, which comprises about 80% of the body surface, has mirror-like quality. The researchers found that the metallic reflection colors can be attributed to constructive interference of light at the layers of the cuticle, with no pigments involved. The color changes during pupal development can be explained by the formation or decomposition of these layers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
