It highlights that erupted lavas may be 100-250\u00b0C cooler than the parental magma entering the magma chamber, and that observations of erupted lavas do not form a useful reference point for reconstructing the thermal budget of the igneous process. The energy content of a volcano may be greater than indicated by the rate of energy output as lava, and the model may also apply to the volcanic heat budget at mid-ocean ridges.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Volcanology"}
