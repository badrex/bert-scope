The synaptonemal complex is a tripartite structure involved in the pairing of homologous chromosomes. The authors provide electron micrographs and observations from various plants, assessing the evidence suggesting that both lateral and central elements in the complex are ribonucleoprotein structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Cytogenetics"}
