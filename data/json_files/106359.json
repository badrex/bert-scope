The Electrophorus, invented by Mr. Volta, is a valuable addition to electrical apparatus, providing a continuous source of electricity for various experiments. The author explores different methods to increase the electrical force of the Electrophorus and explains how the machine can be used to charge Leyden phials strongly. The article also touches upon the principles of electricity, such as the existence of the electric fluid in all substances, its repulsive nature, and the state of electricity in a body.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
