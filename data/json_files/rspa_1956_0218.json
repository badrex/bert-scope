They found that the reaction exhibits an autocatalytic behavior, with the overall activation energy being 53 and 61 kcal in an old and a new vessel, respectively. The results show that the pressure change is a valid measure of the reaction's extent, and the maximum rate is dependent on the initial partial pressure of methyl alcohol and the oxygen partial pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
