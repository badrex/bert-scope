These stones have a regular parallelepiped shape and are found in the Spring of La Fontaine du Salut. The author also examines the geological and mineralogical properties of these stones, including their formation and the presence of transparent fibers. He suggests that further study of these stones could provide insights into the formation of other figured stones.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
