Hofmann, and Auguste Cahours, studied the properties and reactions of allylic alcohol and its derivatives. They discovered new compounds, such as allylamine and diallylamine, and discussed the potential of olefiant gas and its homologues to produce mono-acid alcohols. Their research sheds light on the second group of alcohols and contributes to the understanding of organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
