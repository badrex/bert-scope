The oestrous cycle in the Chinese hamster is similar to that of the mouse and rat, with an average length of 4.3 days. The vaginal cycle also exhibits similar phases, including nucleated epithelial cells, leucocytes, and cornification. However, no copulation was observed during the study, and further research is needed to understand the complete sexual cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
