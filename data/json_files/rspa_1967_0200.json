They measured the dark conductivity and photoconductivity excitation spectra, finding a weak peak at 25,000 cm^-1 and a stronger peak at 13,300 cm^-1. The study provides a foundation for understanding the potential functions of \u03b2-carotene in biological situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
