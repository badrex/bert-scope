They calculated the number of atomic displacements produced at a particular incident electron energy and correlated it with experimentally determined point defect concentrations. The study focused on binary semiconductors, using techniques like photoluminescence and cathodoluminescence to monitor atomic displacements and determine displacement threshold energies. This research provides a precise method for investigating the production of atomic displacements and understanding lattice damage in binary compounds."}
