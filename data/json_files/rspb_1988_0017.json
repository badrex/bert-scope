The results show that only about 50% of eclosing females become egg layers, and factors such as the number of empty cells in the parent nest and the wasp's feeding rate during adult life predict the probability of egg-laying. This suggests that not all females in primitively eusocial insect societies are potentially capable of becoming egg layers, and reigning queens and possibly other adults may influence the production of new queens.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
