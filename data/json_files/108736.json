This equation simplifies the solution process and depends on a single equation of the sixth order. The author explains the connection between the new auxiliary equation and the resolvent-product equation, and demonstrates how the roots of the given quintic equation can be found using the new method.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
