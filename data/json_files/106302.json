He found that his experiments contradicted Buffon's findings, suggesting that the increase in weight of heated iron might be due to the iron acquiring some properties of steel. Whitehurst also proposed a possible explanation for the error in Buffon's experiment, which could be due to the difference in expansion of the beam from which the iron hung.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
