The research finds that nearly all ionization occurs at the surfaces of glowing electrodes, and that negative ions have much higher velocities than positive ions. These findings help explain the phenomena of unipolar conduction and contribute to the development of sensitive instruments for measuring the gravitational constant.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
