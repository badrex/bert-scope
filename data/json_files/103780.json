He used a 24-foot telescope and a micrometer to measure the planet's diameter, distance from the Sun, and its position in the sky. These observations allowed Halley to refine the understanding of Mercury's motion and improve the accuracy of astronomical calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
