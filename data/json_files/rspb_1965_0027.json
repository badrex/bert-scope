R. Gilby and D. F. Waterhouse discovered the composition of the scent of the green vegetable bug, Nezara viridula, by analyzing its secretion using various chromatography techniques. They identified twenty components, with three previously known compounds: trans-hex-2-enal, trans-dec-2-enal, and n-tridecane. The study helps in understanding the role of these chemicals in insect defense and the biochemical pathways involved in scent production.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
