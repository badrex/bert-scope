They observed that when certain acids and alkalis were mixed, they created gas bubbles, and when mixed in a vacuum, these bubbles expanded like regular air. The experiments also showed that the type of gas produced varied depending on the substances mixed, and that some gases were not stable and disappeared over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas laws"}
