He explains how to create these wires by coating a central wire of platinum with silver and then drawing it out to a much smaller diameter. Wollaston also discusses the potential uses of these fine wires, such as in astronomical instruments, and tests their tenacity by measuring their strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
