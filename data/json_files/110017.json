He finds that the fluid is nearly pure water and the gas is mostly azote, existing in a state of rarefaction. The author suggests that atmospheric air might have been originally included and that the oxygen might have been absorbed by the water. The results obtained are difficult to explain unless by supposing the water and silica separated from each other at a very high temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
