The author's experiments on isolated frog muscles show that the production of carbon dioxide does not increase during muscle contraction, contradicting the inogen theory. This study calls for a reevaluation of the understanding of cellular respiration and muscle energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
