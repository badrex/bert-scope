They study the composition of root hairs and nodules, discovering cellulose, calcium pectate, and a resistant substance in the root hairs. The resistant substance is soluble in caustic alkali and ammonia but insoluble in other chemicals, suggesting its potential role in the plant's defense against bacterial infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
