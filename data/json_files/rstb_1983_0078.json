The author describes the three types of safety cabinets, their design features, and the methods used to test their containment performance. The author also introduces the concept of an operator protection factor and proposes a test method using potassium iodide droplets to evaluate containment without producing microbial contamination.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Aerobiology"}
