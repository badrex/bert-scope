It discusses their evolutionary context, pathways to and from the parasitoid lifeway, and provides an overview of the different types of parasitoids. The article also highlights the importance of studying non-hymenopteran parasitoids, as they are often overlooked in comparison to the more commonly studied parasitic Hymenoptera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
