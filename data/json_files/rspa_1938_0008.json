They establish a general theorem that states that a non-linear configuration of a molecule will be unstable unless the degeneracy is the special twofold one that can occur only when the molecule contains an odd number of electrons. The authors also explore the possibility of spin forces stabilizing a non-linear configuration that is unstable due to orbital degeneracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Chemistry"}
