Cayley discusses his work on the transformation of elliptic functions and the modular equations related to them. He explores the mathematical properties of these functions and their applications in various mathematical transformations. Cayley's research contributes to the understanding of elliptic functions and their significance in number theory and algebra.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
