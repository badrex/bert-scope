They found that patients with strictly localized tuberculosis had low and consistent opsonic power, while those with tuberculosis associated with constitutional disturbance had varying opsonic power. This research suggested that measuring opsonic power could be a useful tool in diagnosing tuberculosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Immunology"}
