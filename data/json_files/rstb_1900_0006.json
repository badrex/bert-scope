They find that the average number of collector branches in embryos is greater than in adults, suggesting a reduction in the nervus collector during the later life of the individual. The study also reveals variations in the number of branches and the position of the pelvic girdle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate morphology"}
