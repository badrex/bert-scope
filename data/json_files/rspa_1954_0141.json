The authors conducted experiments using benzoic acid and water as the primary system, supporting the solid spheres from downstream. They found that the rate of mass transfer varies over the surface area of the sphere, with the downstream area becoming more effective at higher Reynolds numbers. The results provide data useful for predicting mass-transfer rates from solid surfaces and outside film coefficients in liquid-liquid extraction and gas absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
