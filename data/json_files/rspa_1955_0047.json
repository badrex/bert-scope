They discovered that the quantum efficiency of cobaltous ion formation is twice the primary quantum efficiency. The study also showed that ethyl alcohol and acetone do not affect the photochemical quantum yield, and the reaction rate can be represented by a pseudomonomolecular mechanism involving water molecules. The suitability of the trioxalatocobaltate III complex for chemical actionometry is analyzed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
