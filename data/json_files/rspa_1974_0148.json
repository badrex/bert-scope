The authors calculate various properties, such as cohesive energy, phase transition pressure, and phonon dispersion relations, and compare their results with experimental data. The deformable shell model effectively includes many-body interactions and can be applied to both static and dynamic properties of alkali halide crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
