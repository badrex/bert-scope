The authors found that cooling bismuth reduces its resistance, and when transversely magnetized, the resistance increases. They also discovered that bismuth is a remarkable exception among metals due to its large coefficient of the Hall effect and the degree to which its resistance is affected by transverse magnetization and low temperatures. The presence of impurities in the metal significantly reduces these unique qualities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
