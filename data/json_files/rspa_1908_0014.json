They describe a series of concentric envelopes photographed using a spectroheliograph, which indicates a connection between the prominence material and the structure of the lower corona. The authors suggest that these envelope forms may be the origin of certain in-curving structures found in coronal streamers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
