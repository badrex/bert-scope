It considers linear and non-linear theories, finding that the velocity of wave propagation can be determined in terms of ascending powers of the square root of the Froude number. The non-linear waves are also analyzed, deriving the solitary and cnoidal wave solutions to a first approximation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
