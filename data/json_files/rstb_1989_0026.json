They focused on hen egg lysozyme (HEL) and its monoclonal antibodies. The crystal structure of a complex formed between HEL and the Fab D1.3 was analyzed, revealing a large complementary surface with close interatomic contacts between the antigen and antibody. This research helps to understand the immune response and improve the use of antibodies as tools for research and medical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
