This challenges the previously held belief that all Rotifera were hermaphrodites. The author provides detailed observations and descriptions of the reproductive processes and differences between male and female specimens, contributing to a better understanding of the sexual reproduction in this class of animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
