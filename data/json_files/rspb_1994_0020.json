The study finds that 5HT, in the presence of NMDA, induces sustained oscillations in membrane potential, which could contribute to the generation of locomotor behavior. These oscillations are dependent on the presence of magnesium ions and are abolished by the NMDA receptor antagonist, APV.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
