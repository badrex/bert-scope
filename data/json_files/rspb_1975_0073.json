They found that the facilitation increased the contractility of the heart cells and was dependent on the external calcium concentration. The results suggest that twitch facilitation is caused by an increase in the inward movement of calcium associated with the action potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Physiology"}
