They discovered a network of minute vessels, called the diaplasmatic system, which connects blood vessels and lymphatics. This system plays a role in secretion and absorption in tissues and may also help transport blood plasma and waste materials in deeper parts of the organism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
