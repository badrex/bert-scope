They found that colors can still be perceived even in extremely low light conditions when the eye is completely rested. The author also discovered that the mental attitude of the observer plays a significant role in subjective phenomena. They used various methods, including light filters and spectra of rarefied gases, to further investigate color perception in faint light.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
