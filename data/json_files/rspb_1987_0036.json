The treatment of rats with 6-aminonicotinamide resulted in an increase in the concentration of 6-phosphogluconate and changes in other metabolites, suggesting that the utilization of glucose via the hexose monophosphate shunt is functionally important in the rat brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
