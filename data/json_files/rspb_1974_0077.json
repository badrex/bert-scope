The muscle fibers are obliquely striated and multinucleate, with no sarcoplasmic reticulum or invaginations of the sarcolemma. The findings contribute to understanding the role of these muscle fibers in the locomotion of the tunicate and the structure of other tunicate muscle fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Tunicate Biology"}
