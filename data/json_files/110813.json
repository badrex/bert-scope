He describes the spleen's cells as being formed of a lining membrane and fibro-elastic tissue, which help in blood circulation. The spleen also plays a role in the lymphatic system and can contribute to congestion in the veins if an obstructing cause arises. This paper includes illustrations and diagrams to support the author's findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
