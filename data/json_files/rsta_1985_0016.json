It also discusses the behavior of other stranded transition metal chalcogenides, focusing on discommensuration arrays and their role in depinning processes. The differences between NbSe\\lt;sub\\gt;3\\lt;/sub\\gt; and other materials like TaSe\\lt;sub\\gt;3\\lt;/sub\\gt; are explored, providing an overview of the materials aspect of the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
