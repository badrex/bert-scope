They found a non-zero quadrupole interaction due to relativistic effects, which was confirmed through their experimental measurements. This discovery provides a better understanding of the hyperfine structure of atoms with half-filled shells.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
