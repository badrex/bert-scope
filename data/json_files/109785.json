He explored the similarities between oxymuriatic and fluoric compounds and tested various hypotheses about the composition of fluoric acid. Davy concluded that fluoric acid is composed of hydrogen and a unique principle called fluorine, which is similar to chlorine. He also suggested that further research could lead to the separation of fluorine as a gaseous element.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Compounds and Reactions"}
