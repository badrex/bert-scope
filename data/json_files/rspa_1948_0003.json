{"article_id": "rspa_1948_0003", "revised_title": "Quantum Mechanics and the Kinetic Basis of Thermodynamics", "semantic_tags": ["Thermodynamics", "Quantum Mechanics", "Statistical Mechanics", "Kinetic Theory", "Entropy"], "tldr": "The authors present a kinetic theory of thermodynamics based on quantum mechanics, deriving the laws of thermodynamics using the statistical operator and density matrix. They explore two main types of irreversible processes, transformation of energy into heat and conduction of heat, and demonstrate how entropy increases in both cases, leading to a state of equilibrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
