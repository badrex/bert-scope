The authors find that entropy, which measures the spread of fecundity-mortality schedules, is a more suitable measure of fitness under constant environmental conditions. This research has implications for understanding the persistence of diseases and genetic traits in populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
