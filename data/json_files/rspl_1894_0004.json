They found that legitimate natality declines after the first child and that physiological fertility arrives later, remains high, and decreases at a more advanced age. The difference between physiological and actual fertility shows the influence of moral factors, with moral restraint having a significant impact on fertility rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Demography"}
