They compare the predictions with actual data and suggest that with good values for tidal constants, the tables can lead to excellent predictions. The author also considers the applicability of these predictions to ports of second-rate importance and the potential loss of accuracy in abridged tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
