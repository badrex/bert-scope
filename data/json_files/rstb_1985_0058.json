The researchers found that these neurons receive convergent input from the face and mouth and respond to different types of stimuli, including noxious stimulation. This suggests that the rostral trigeminal nuclei may be involved in transmitting nociceptive impulses from oral and peri-oral regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
