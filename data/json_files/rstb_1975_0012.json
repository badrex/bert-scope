They found that these toxins bind to the sodium channels, blocking their function. The study provides evidence that the density of sodium channels in various nerves is relatively low, and the toxins have similar actions despite being different molecules. This research helps to understand the mechanisms of these toxins and their effects on nerve cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
