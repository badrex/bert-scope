It reviews the current understanding of substorms and their relation to space-based and ground-based observations. The study focuses on the European incoherent scatter facility (EISCAT) measurements, which provide a more complete and continuous picture of the substorm processes. The article highlights the quasi-periodic nature of ionospheric flow effects and their relation to geomagnetic disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Magnetosphere and Ionosphere"}
