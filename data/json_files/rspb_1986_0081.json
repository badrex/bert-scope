The research identifies three major pollen assemblage zones, revealing the area's transition from temperate rainforest to grassland and back to sub-alpine vegetation over time. The findings are compared with other sites in Tasmania, Chile, and New Zealand, providing insights into the region's environmental history.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
