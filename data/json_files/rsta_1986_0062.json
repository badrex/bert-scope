It identifies three classes of catalytic reactions and presents case histories for each class. The article highlights the importance of high coordination sites on atomically rough surfaces for high reactivity and introduces a theory that correlates increased charge fluctuations at these sites with enhanced catalytic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Science"}
