The authors demonstrate the method's application to three autonomous equations, including the van der Pol equation, the modified van der Pol equation, and the van der Pol equation with escape. The study focuses on the stability of orbits and the effects of amplitude variations on mean oscillation and frequency.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
