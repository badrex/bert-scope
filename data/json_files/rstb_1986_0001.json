The study reveals that natural populations of E. coli contain a large amount of genetic variation and multiple alleles at many loci. The article also explores the role of transposable elements in the evolution of bacterial DNA and their impact on genetic variation and gene expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
