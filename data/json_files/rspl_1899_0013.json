The authors found that the right hand is more highly correlated than the left hand, and that the hand is more highly correlated than the skull and long bones. The study also discusses the potential influence of use and natural selection on the variability and correlation of the hand.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Evolution"}
