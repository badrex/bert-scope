The epithelial cells maintain quasi-isotonic fluid transfer over a wide range of osmolarities. The results suggest that water crosses the epithelium through extracellular routes via intercellular junctions, challenging the standing-gradient osmotic theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
