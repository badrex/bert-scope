He explains that birds change climates for a more suitable temperature and food supply. Catesby also examines the migration of winter birds, such as fieldfares and redwings, which are difficult to account for due to the lack of apparent necessity for their departure. He suggests that these birds may change their diet and travel gradually to their summer retreats in more moderate countries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
