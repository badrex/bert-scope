They found that the contractile organs in leaves have porous tissues that allow for the redistribution of fluids, which is related to the extent and speed of leaf movements. The study also highlights the importance of structural arrangements in the occurrence of these movements and suggests that they may be an indication of the plant's ability to redistribute fluids in the tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
