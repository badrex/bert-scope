The authors found that hydrogen is absorbed by silver and that the solubility varies with temperature and pressure. They also discovered that the rate of hydrogen diffusion through quartz is directly proportional to the pressure and is consistent with previous findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
