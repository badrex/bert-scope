The model considers the interaction of antibody immunoglobulins with specific cellular sites, competing with non-specific immunoglobulins. The predictions of this model suggest that equilibration will be too slow to be observed in typical passive sensitization experiments, there will be no fast initial phase of sensitization, and that sensitizing immunoglobulins with a slower rate of onset will persist for a longer time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
