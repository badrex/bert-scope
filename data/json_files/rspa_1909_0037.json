The authors discuss the use of Simpson's Rule for calculating loop areas and provide tables of values for various loops. They also describe a simpler method for integration when the upper limit is not small. The article demonstrates the effectiveness of these techniques in calculating areas and provides insights into the behavior of Fresnel integrals.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
