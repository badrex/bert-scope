They discovered that the spleen plays a role in absorbing fluids from the stomach and transferring them into the bloodstream. The spleen's size and appearance change depending on the amount of fluids it absorbs. This research also suggests that the spleen may be connected to the stomach through vessels that allow colored liquids to enter the bloodstream.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
