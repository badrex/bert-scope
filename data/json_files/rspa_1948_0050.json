They use the relativistically invariant theory of the retarded interaction of two charged particles and the Fermi theory of beta-decay to estimate the cross-section for the excitation of nuclei. The study focuses on electric dipole, electric quadrupole, and magnetic dipole transitions and provides a theoretical framework for understanding the process of nuclear excitation by electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
