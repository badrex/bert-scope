They investigate the nature of these symbols and demonstrate how they can be used to solve equations with coefficients involving independent variables. The author also explores cases of symbolic division and shows how functional equations can be expressed in a symbolical form.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mathematical Analysis", "sub_discipline": "Mathematical Applications"}
