The authors find that factors such as honesty, detectability, and perception play a significant role in the evolution of both male ornaments and female preferences. They also discover that even small differences between habitats can trigger dramatic changes in female preferences, leading to population divergence and ultimately generating new species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
