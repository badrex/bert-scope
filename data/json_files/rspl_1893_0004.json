They find that the archesporium in Equisetaceae is not of hypodermal origin, and that the synangium in Psilotaceae originates from the upper surface of the sporangiophore. The author also suggests that the Psilotaceae may have originated from a strobiloid type similar to Lycopodium and compares the synangium of Psilotaceae to the \"fertile frond\" of Ophioglossaceae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
