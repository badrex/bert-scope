They explored the possibility that the spectra are produced by different gases or different modifications of oxygen. Additionally, they studied the phenomenon of dielectric hysteresis in a condenser and its relation to the rate of dissipation of energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
