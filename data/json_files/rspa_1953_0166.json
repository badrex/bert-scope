The authors discuss the self-consistent field model, Coulomb interactions, Jahn-Teller effect, and spin-orbit coupling in the context of octahedral complexes containing transition elements. The study aims to provide a general framework for understanding the magnetic behavior of these complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
