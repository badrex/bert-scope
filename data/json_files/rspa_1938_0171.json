The authors describe their experimental setup and findings on the effects of pipe size, shape, and head pressure on the flow types, including Borda free flow, Borda full flow, and vortex formation. The research provides insights into optimizing overflow design for large reservoirs.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics and Hydraulics"}
