F. Lewis and E. H. Sondheimer, explore the theory of magneto-resistance effects in polar semi-conductors. They develop general expressions for the Hall coefficient and transverse magneto-resistance effect, discussing their variation with temperature, magnetic field strength, and electron degeneracy. The study reveals a large magneto-resistance effect for non-degenerate electrons at low temperatures, which contrasts with the prediction of the free-path theory. The Hall coefficient remains close to 1/(ne) where n is the number of electrons per unit volume.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Semiconductors"}
