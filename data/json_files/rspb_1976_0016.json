It provides evidence of a parallelism between seed output and factors that determine the degree of scattering, suggesting that the reproductive capacity of wind-dispersed species tends to prevail through natural selection. The study also highlights the significant wastage of propagules in wind-dispersed species and their vulnerability to adverse habitat conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Plant Science"}
