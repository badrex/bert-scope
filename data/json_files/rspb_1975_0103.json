They discovered that exposing the ganglia to high-potassium solutions or electrical stimulation increased the level of motion within the preparation. The findings suggest that depolarization induces particle motion in nerve cells and may be related to a partial liquefaction of the axoplasm caused by calcium ions entering the cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
