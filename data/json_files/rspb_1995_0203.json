They used different distribution models, such as Poisson, conditional Poisson, and negative binomial, to analyze the data and calculate the likelihood of the models. This study helps in understanding the population genetic structure of malaria parasites and can contribute to malaria control strategies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Genetics"}
