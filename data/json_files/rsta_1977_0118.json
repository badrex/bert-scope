The authors explain the complex mixture of materials found in these nodules, including crystallites of various minerals, organic and colloidal matter, and rocks in different stages of degradation. They also describe the challenges in characterizing the minerals in these nodules due to their fine-grained nature and complicated internal structures. The authors highlight the potential of manganese nodules as a valuable resource for the 21st century, as advancements in ocean mining technology and extractive metallurgical techniques have made harvesting this resource both feasible and economically viable.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
