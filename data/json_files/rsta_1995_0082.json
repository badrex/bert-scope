The research uses controlled periodic disturbances to excite specific waves and observe their resonant growth. The findings show that detuned subharmonic resonance leads to enhanced growth of modes and the generation of numerous discrete modes through successive sum and difference interactions. This process accounts for the rapid spectral filling and low-frequency modulation commonly observed in natural subharmonic transition.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
