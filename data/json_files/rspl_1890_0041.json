The method involves taking means over specific periods to account for the complex interactions between the moon, sun, and Earth, and provides a way to reduce a series of observations without prior knowledge of tidal theory. The author demonstrates the method using a three-month series of observations at Bombay.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
