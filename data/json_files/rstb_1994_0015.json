The research reveals that A. bifida has a unique brooding method, maintaining a high level of sexual maturity throughout the annual cycle. The study also highlights the presence of three cellular gametogenic features, such as facets on the mature oocyte cell wall, nutritive phagocytes in the gonad lumen, and yolk nuclei in the pre-vitellogenic oocytes, at all times of the seasonal cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinoderm Biology"}
