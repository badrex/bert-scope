The research focuses on the woods of Silver Spruce, Ash, and Pitch Pine, and provides insights into the relationship between the structure of the cell walls and the mechanical properties of wood. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the fundamental structure and properties of plant cell walls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
