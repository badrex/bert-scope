They find that the electrical resistivity produced by dislocations depends on the strain components and the type of dislocation. The method is applied to estimate the resistivity in sodium and copper, showing that screw dislocations contribute significantly to the total resistivity in copper.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
