They compare genetic trees constructed from DNA polymorphism data with archaeological data on human migrations. The results support the hypothesis of an initial African and non-African divergence for modern humans and provide insights into the relationships between human populations and the impact of natural selection on certain alleles. The study also highlights the importance of using a large number of genetic markers for accurate estimates of genetic distances and tree reconstruction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
