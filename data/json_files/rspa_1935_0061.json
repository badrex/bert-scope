They found that the nuclear spin is 5/2 by analyzing the fine structure term multiplicity and comparing the interval factors of different terms. This study provides a better understanding of iodine's atomic structure and contributes to the field of atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
