The study assumes a skin-friction layer near the bottom and a constant eddy viscosity above it. The research provides steady-state solutions for channels of uniform width and depth, a uniformly convergent channel, and a non-uniform channel. The findings can be applied to the English Channel, where a program of observations is planned.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
