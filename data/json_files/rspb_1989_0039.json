The study finds that outward and inward currents are activated by calcium elevation and oscillate in phase with oscillations of cytosolic calcium. The outward current is due to the activation of a large unit-conductance Ca2+ and voltage-dependent K+ channel, while the inward current is likely carried predominantly by Cl-. Buffering calcium at resting levels eliminates current responses to muscarinic agonists, suggesting that calcium is the only significant second messenger involved in the short-term control of this conductance by acetylcholine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
