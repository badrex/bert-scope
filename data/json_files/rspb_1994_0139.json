These wingbeat-generated sounds increase the discharge rate of the moth's A1 acoustic cell, which is responsible for detecting bat echolocation calls. The sounds may provide background noise for the moth to recognize bat calls and limit the lower sensitivity of the auditory system. However, the sounds appear to be mismatched for the low-frequency hearing of bats that hunt by passive listening, making them unlikely to aid in passive aerial foraging by bats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
