The model includes details of host demographics and natural history, such as the existence of infectious and non-infectious carriers. The authors discuss the biological assumptions of the model and review hepatitis epidemiological data to estimate model parameter values. The model can be used to assess strategies of mass vaccination and predict the impact on hepatitis epidemiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
