They consider the spin-orbit coupling matrix elements within the shell and use a basis of symmetry-adapted components. The study provides insights into the behavior of molecular ions and the limitations of applying Hund's rules to polyatomic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
