They propose a more complex model that incorporates hitchhiking, localized recombination, and ecotypic structure to better explain these observations. The study concludes that these factors contribute to the understanding of bacterial evolution and adaptation to different habitats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
