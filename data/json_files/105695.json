Despite various medical treatments, her condition worsened. The author, William Watson, decided to try electrical stimulation to treat the girl's condition. He found that by electrifying specific muscles, he could loosen the rigid muscles and improve the patient's condition. This case study marked an early step in the development of electromedicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology"}
