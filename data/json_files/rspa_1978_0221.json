It highlights the importance of understanding fluid dynamics and convection in microgravity environments to improve crystal growth processes on Earth. The author suggests that Spacelab can help transition crystal growth from an art to a science by providing valuable data and insights into the effects of microgravity on crystal growth processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystal Growth"}
