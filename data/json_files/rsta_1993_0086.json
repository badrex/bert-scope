The authors emphasize the need for better quality data from deep formation waters and a better understanding of the complexing of Si and Al in solutions. They also explore the potential role of microbes living on silica surfaces in producing organic acids that may influence solubility.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Sedimentology and Stratigraphy"}
