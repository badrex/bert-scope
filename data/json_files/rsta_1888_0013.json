They found that the presence of impurities significantly alters the tenacity and extensibility of metals, and that these changes can be explained by the Law of Periodicity. This research has implications for understanding the behavior of metals in industrial applications and improving their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
