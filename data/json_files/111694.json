They found that plants, especially flowers, can have varying temperatures compared to the surrounding grass and soil. The author also observed that certain plants seem to repel fogs, while others attract them. These findings contribute to our understanding of the relationship between plants, temperature, and meteorological phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
