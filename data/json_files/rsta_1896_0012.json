They compared the intensity of the coronal light with that of a glow-lamp, using the method of Bunsen and Abney. The measurements were part of the work of the expedition to Senegambia, led by Professor Thorpe. The authors describe the methods, instruments, and challenges faced during the observations, such as the excessive dryness and dust at the observation site in Fundium, Senegal.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
