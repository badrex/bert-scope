The wave-meter is highly accurate and can be used for various applications, including measuring radiofrequency and wave-length of electrical oscillations. The device is based on the principles of a three-electrode valve, invented by H. Abraham and E. Bloch, and offers a valuable source of harmonics for producing known radio frequencies with steadiness and consistency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
