The absorption spectrum of the yellow lens revealed two peaks at wavelengths 425 and 460 nm. The fish's retina has a unique structure with two layers of rod cells and an astaxanthin-type retinal tapetum. The ecological significance of the yellow lens and the tapetum are discussed in relation to the fish's orbital light organ with a reddish filter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
