The author discusses the impact of compressibility and non-homogeneity on the shapes of astronomical matter, providing a detailed study of the configurations possible when the compressibility is such that pressure and density are connected by a specific law. The findings have important implications for understanding the structure and behavior of stars and other celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
