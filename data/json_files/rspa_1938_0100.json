They demonstrate how Mayer's approach can be used to derive the conditions for co-existence of multiple phases, such as the triple point. The study focuses on the statistical mechanics of condensing systems and the application of complex integration techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
