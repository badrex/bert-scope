It shows that varying the size of the litter at birth can significantly influence the rate of growth, and that early nutrition plays a crucial role in brain development. The research also highlights the importance of cholesterol in the structural development of the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
