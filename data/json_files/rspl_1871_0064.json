They analyze the geometry and placement of these muscles, demonstrating that they are designed for optimal efficiency. Additionally, the author discusses the application of geometric principles to other aspects of animal anatomy, such as bones, and the relationship between these principles and the production of maximum work.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Musculoskeletal System"}
