The authors explore the Doppler effect, Faraday effect, and wave refraction to understand the ionosphere's influence on radio waves. They conclude that accurate measurements of the Doppler effect and angle of incidence, along with a well-known satellite orbit, can provide valuable information about the ionization density at the satellite.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
