The researchers found that persistent karyomegaly, caused by Penicillium aurantiogriseum nephrotoxins, led to significant histopathological changes in the rat kidney. These changes persisted for at least twelve months after the nephrotoxin dosage ceased. The findings suggest that Penicillium nephrotoxins could be a potential factor in human chronic renal disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Histology"}
