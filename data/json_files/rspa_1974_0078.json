The author focuses on a single red blood cell in a uniform shear flow, analyzing its deformation and behavior. The study assumes a flexible elastic membrane and calculates the resulting stresses and displacements for low shear-rates. The author also investigates the behavior of Band's viscoelastic membrane breakdown model when subjected to these stresses at higher shear-rates. The predicted times to haemolysis are evaluated for various shear-rates and compared with published experimental results, showing order of magnitude agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
