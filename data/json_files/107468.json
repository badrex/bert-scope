They discovered that channels form in coagulated blood due to the extraction of carbonic acid gas, and these channels allow blood to circulate through the coagulum. The author also demonstrated this phenomenon in blood coagulated within living animals, proving that the channels have a connection with neighboring arteries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
