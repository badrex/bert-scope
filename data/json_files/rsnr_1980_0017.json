Astbury and Ross G. Harrison, who both believed that the organization and form of biological materials, such as wool fibers or the limb-bud in an amphibian embryo, depended on molecular structure and pattern. They conducted experiments to study the molecular basis of polarity and symmetry in developing embryos, with Astbury focusing on X-ray analysis of natural fibers and Harrison on transplantation experiments in amphibian larvae. Their work aimed to understand the role of molecular patterns in the development of form in living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
