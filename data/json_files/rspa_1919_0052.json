They discovered that the colors of the striae, as seen in the Foucault test, are complementary to the colors of the central fringes in the laminar diffraction patterns produced by them. The study also explored the use of etched glass plates and the artificial reproduction of striae, as well as the doubling of striae when using a central stop in the Foucault test.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
