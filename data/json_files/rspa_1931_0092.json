They discovered that the color and absorption spectrum of these solutions are influenced by dichroism, which is determined by the occurrence or non-occurrence of solvation. Two types of solutions were found, characterized by maxima around 360 and 460, with the molecular extinction coefficient being similar in both cases. The study extends the understanding of dichroism in iodine solutions to iodine chloride solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
