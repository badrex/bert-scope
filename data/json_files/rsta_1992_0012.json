The authors derive a generalized expression for flame stretch and propose a new dimensionless correlation for turbulent burning velocities. They also discuss the role of flame stretch in laminar and turbulent flame extinction and the influence of turbulence on burning velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
