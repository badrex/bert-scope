The authors used novel technology to separate shape and colour data and found that both shape and colour provide useful information for categorization decisions. Shape information was particularly useful for race decisions, while colour dominated sex decisions. The results have implications for understanding face recognition and potential applications in telecommunications.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
