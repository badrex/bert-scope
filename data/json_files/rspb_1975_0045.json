The results show that adjuvants can have immunopotentiating or enhancing effects depending on the treatment conditions. The H-Y barrier skin grafting technique appears to be a useful tool for studying adjuvants and their mechanisms of action, which is essential for optimizing their use in cancer treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Immunology > Adjuvants and Skin Grafting"}
