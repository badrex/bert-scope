This new method was tested at the Trinity House and found to be more effective than traditional methods. The lime ball light produced distinct shadows and a long stream of rays that could be seen from a distance, making it easier to spot the light even when it was not directly visible.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Lighthouse technology"}
