They discovered that performance is determined by two classes of orientation-sensitive filters with preferred orientations close to the vertical and horizontal. The precision of orientation estimates is worst near the vertical and horizontal, which contrasts with the classical oblique effect in vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
