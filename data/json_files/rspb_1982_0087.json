They found that the fibre matrix theory better explains the hydraulic permeability of the basement membrane, but a change in the configuration of the collagenous macromolecules composing the membrane is necessary to account for the profound reduction in hydraulic conductivity under increasing pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
