They demonstrate the importance of considering both direct and indirect relativistic effects in these calculations, and show that neglecting these effects can lead to unreliable predictions. The method is applied to several ionic solids, providing accurate results for their interaction energies and lattice properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum chemistry"}
