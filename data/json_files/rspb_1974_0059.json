They construct a model for the native tendon pattern and reveal the role of teleopeptides in the structure. The findings provide a detailed understanding of the structure of tendon and its relation to the fibrous long spacing structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
