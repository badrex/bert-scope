They determined nitrogen atom concentrations using nitric oxide titration and found that the nitrogen afterglow intensity was proportional to the nitrogen atom concentration and independent of total pressure. The results showed that about 50% of the recombination passed through the N2(a) state, which is the precursor of the afterglow.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas-phase reactions and chemical kinetics"}
