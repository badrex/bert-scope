The research explores various habitats, including beachrock, Phyllochaetopterus and Amphiroa colonies, and silty-sand deposits of Thalassia flats. The authors discuss the polychaete species' interactions with other animals, such as boring sipunculids and calcareous algae, and highlight the importance of these relationships in the marine ecosystem.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
