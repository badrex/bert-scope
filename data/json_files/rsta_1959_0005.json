The author divides the ocean into cells of finite size and represents each cell as a two-dimensional electric network. This method allows for the analysis of complex cases and can be applied to various problems with simple and small-scale equipment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
