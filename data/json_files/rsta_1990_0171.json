The authors outline the behavior of fluids in these systems and explore the potential of NMR imaging to reveal internal structures and properties of porous solids. They present experimental results for imaging in model porous solids and natural rocks, demonstrating the capability of NMR to indirectly image the solid structures through the signal of fluids permeating the pore space. The article also addresses the spatial heterogeneity of these materials and proposes strategies for characterizing their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Geophysics"}
