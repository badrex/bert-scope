They develop a theory that includes the effects of dispersion and find that the optical rotation includes a 'dragging coefficient' equal to that found for aether drag in the transverse case or in the longitudinal case for a fluid medium with fixed boundaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
