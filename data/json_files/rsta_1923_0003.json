They found that the artificial double refraction in these materials is dependent on the stress applied, and there is no indication of a residual stress-optical effect. The study also introduced the concepts of optical creep on loading and recovery, which describe the gradual increase and decrease of the optical effect over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
