The Arctic sea ice cover plays a crucial role in heat and energy exchange between the ocean and atmosphere, and its reduction will affect the Arctic marine ecosystem. The article discusses the unique physical and chemical conditions of the Arctic environment, the impact of rising temperatures on the Arctic marine epipelagic system, and the specialized communities living within the sea ice and the water column.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
