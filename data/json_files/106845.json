He discovered a new compound acid that could be useful in separating metals. The author also observed the effects of compounding vitriolic and nitrous acids on the dissolution of metals and the production of gases. This research contributed to the understanding of chemical reactions and the separation of metals in metallurgy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid chemistry"}
