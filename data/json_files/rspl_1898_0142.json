They discuss methods for observing stomatal activity and transpiration, using tools such as hygroscopic papers and a stomatal transpirationroscope. These methods help to understand the conditions and behavior of stomata in the Fucaceae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
