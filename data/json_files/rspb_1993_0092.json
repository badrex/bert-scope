They observed that taxis waves, which consume different substrates, can create motionless patterns when they collide and annihilate. This wave mechanism provides a new approach to understanding biological pattern formation and offers potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
