The authors analyze the Zeeman patterns of the transitions and provide interpretations involving a magnetically forced transition to a level close to 1. They also explore the Landau resonances and the changes in magnetic structures over the whole spectrum studied.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
