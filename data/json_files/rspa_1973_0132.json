The researchers discovered a new transition between perpendicular moments, attributed to a 1A-1G transition. They developed a theory for treating absorption data in ordered media and examined the effects of molecular orientation distribution. The technique presented offers better identification of electronic transitions compared to fluorescence methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
