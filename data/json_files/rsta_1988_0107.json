The article also describes the use of double acetylene carbocupration for the stereospecific preparation of dienes, as demonstrated by the synthesis of the Navel Orangeworm pheromone. The potential of organocopper reagents in organic synthesis is emphasized, and their versatile nature is illustrated through various synthetic approaches.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
