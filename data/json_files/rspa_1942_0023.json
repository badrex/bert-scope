Dirac discusses the physical interpretation of quantum mechanics and its challenges when extended to a relativistic framework. He highlights the principles of superposition and indeterminacy, and explores the mathematical formalism and its difficulties in aligning with the restricted principle of relativity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
