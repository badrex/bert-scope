They focus on the interaction of entropy fluctuations with turbine blade rows, which is an important mechanism at low jet velocities. The model predicts the level and spectrum of the excess engine noise, providing insights into the complex relationship between combustion, entropy fluctuations, and engine noise.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aeroacoustics and Turbomachinery"}
