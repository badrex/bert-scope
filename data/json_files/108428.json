The method involves using a cylindrical glass case with slits for the instruments' stems and a wind- and waterproof zinc case. The apparatus allows for continuous printing of the thermometers' scales and indicates the position of the mercury, making it easier to estimate temperature and avoid scale distortion. This method can be useful for improving the accuracy of magnetic observations and understanding the changes of force in different climates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
