They found that chitin is the major structural component in the cell walls of all five genera, with cellulose present only in trace amounts. The electron micrographs showed chitin microfibrils in various forms and arrangements, contributing to the complex structure of the cell walls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
