They predict the transverse displacement of an image formed on the far side of a dispersive medium in uniform transverse motion, considering the dispersion to be mild enough for energy propagation to be described by the group velocity. This study contributes to understanding the 'aether drag' effect observed by R. V. Jones in 1972.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism and Optics"}
