The model accounts for various experimental developments since the M.N.T. model and includes new equations for the sodium-potassium exchange pump, calcium sequestration, and release mechanisms. The model successfully reproduces intracellular sodium concentration changes, action potential duration, and responses to current pulses applied during the plateau and pacemaker phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
