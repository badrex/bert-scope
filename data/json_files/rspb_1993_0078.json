The results show that endurance exercise can modify the Ca2+- and Sr2+-activated contractile characteristics of muscle fibers, suggesting that exercise may have potential therapeutic benefits for dystrophic muscle conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
