The authors describe the general features and design rules of microwave-multiplexed wideband optical-fibre systems and report on several specific systems developed at GTE Laboratories. They also propose design rules for fibre-optic systems and describe transmission experiments to verify these rules.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telecommunications"}
