The results show a marked positive deviation from ideal behavior, with a tendency to form a low-boiling azeotrope. The data is presented in tabular form, and constants and formulas are provided for calculating values for any pressure, temperature, or composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
