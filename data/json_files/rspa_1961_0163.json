They show that there must be considerable fluctuation in segment length from segment to segment, leading to a characteristic segment length that defines a stable mean strip width. This theory explains the factors that determine the segment length in polymer crystallization and provides a good qualitative and roughly quantitative account of the crystallization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
