The isotopes' higher mass leads to differences in diffusion rates, chemical reactions, and physical and chemical processes in living organisms. The isotopes also play a significant role in nuclear reactions and transformations, leading to the discovery of new particles and the development of new projectiles for studying atomic structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
