These equations are used with a continuum damage mechanics finite element solver to study the behavior of notched tension bars, accurately representing the skeletal effective stress at a point within the notch throat. This approach can be used for materials that fail by grain boundary cavitation or by dislocation multiplication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
