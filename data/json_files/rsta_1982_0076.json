The author assesses the palaeomagnetic data and discusses the limitations of the evidence, questioning the existence of some proposed excursions and highlighting the need for more comprehensive studies to establish their global nature. The article emphasizes the importance of understanding geomagnetic excursions for our understanding of geomagnetic secular variation and the Earth's core.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
