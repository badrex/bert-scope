They found that the breakdown of mirror symmetry in the H3 absorption and emission bands could occur through vibronic coupling of two excited states of the center. The results provide insights into the molecular properties and symmetry of the H3 center in diamond.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
