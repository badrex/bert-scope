Sclerotin is a type of \"tanned protein\" formed by the reaction between dihydroxyphenol and protein, which increases the stability of the protein. The author also finds that lipids are mainly present in the epicuticle, while the exocuticle contains sclerotin and dihydroxyphenols.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
