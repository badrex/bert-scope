The results show that aggregation affects the enzyme's activity, making the allosteric transition occur at a lower level of allosteric activation and making it a more abrupt function of the activation level. This finding has significant implications for the enzyme's role in protein metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
