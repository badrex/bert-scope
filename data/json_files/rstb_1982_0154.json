They discover that this transport process is different from mechanisms proposed for vertebrate tissues and is regulated by a neuropeptide hormone. The study provides insights into the unique mechanisms of potassium chloride reabsorption in insect epithelia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
