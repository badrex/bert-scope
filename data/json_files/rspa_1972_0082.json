It focuses on the temperature jump method as a typical case of a transient method and discusses the computation of relaxation time and ultrasonic absorption and dispersion. The study connects the macroscopic rate constant to the microscopic cross-section for the reacting process, providing a better understanding of chemical reactions and their rate constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
