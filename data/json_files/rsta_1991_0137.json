They reevaluated the model using experimentally measured values and found that the typical eddy scale is approximately larger than the pocket scale. The conclusions about the similar dependencies between the pockets and the typical eddies remain unchanged.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
