These observations aimed to determine the apparent distances and positions of these stars, as well as their proper motions. The findings have implications for understanding the nature of double stars, their positions, and the potential for parallax measurements. This work contributes to the broader field of astronomy and our understanding of the stars and their movements in the sky.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
