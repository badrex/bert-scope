The authors found that Ca2+ and guanine nucleotides are essential effectors for exocytosis, and ATP acts as a modulator. The study provides insights into the complex mechanisms of cellular regulation and signal transduction in biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
