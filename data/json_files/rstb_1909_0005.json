These concretions contain well-preserved plant tissues that provide valuable information for studying botanical anatomy and phylogeny. The authors investigate the geological and stratigraphic context of these structures and discuss the different theories about their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
