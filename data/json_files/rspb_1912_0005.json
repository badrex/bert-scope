They found that the presence of hydrogen cyanide in the plant is influenced by factors such as soil type, climate, and growth conditions. This research highlights the importance of understanding the complex factors that affect plant growth and quality for better agricultural practices.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Science"}
