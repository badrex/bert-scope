The author investigates the factors influencing the survival of different color forms in response to environmental changes, such as industrial pollution. The study demonstrates that natural selection plays a significant role in the dynamics of natural populations, with melanistic forms being favored in polluted areas due to their increased cryptic advantages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolution and Natural Selection"}
