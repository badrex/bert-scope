The goal is to understand the carbon cycle within the ocean and predict how it might change under global climate change. The study focuses on the ecosystem dynamics at the 47\u00b0N 20\u00b0W JGOFS station, aiming to find the best fit for primary production, zooplankton, and other independent data sets while considering the limitations of the model and the need for further development.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
