It found that rabbit serum's interference is mostly due to its y-globulin, and fragment III has at least 3.5 times greater interference than the whole y-globulin molecule. The results suggest that most of the configurations of the rabbit y-globulin molecule recognized by mouse cells as heterologous are carried on fragment III.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
