By applying a limiting process to a special case of acceleration, the author derives the Bondi-Gold solution, which demonstrates how the electromagnetic field tends to zero in certain zones and forms a shock wave in another zone. This solution is shown to be a smooth limit of the Das solution, providing a satisfying explanation for the physical significance of permanent uniform acceleration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
