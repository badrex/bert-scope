The results show that growth rate, cell size, and the balance of RNA to DNA are influenced by temperature. Slower growth is associated with a later maximum in cell size and RNA mass, while faster growth leads to earlier maxima. The findings suggest that as growth rate increases, the production of a 'division factor' lags behind the production of cell substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
