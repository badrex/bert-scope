They examined the growth interruption technique and the'recovery' effect, which involves the return of the specular beam to its pre-growth value after growth cessation. The authors found that the RHEED intensity recovery curves are insensitive to the diffraction condition and can be used to analyze surface-roughness recovery, enabling sensible quantitative studies of recovery.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
