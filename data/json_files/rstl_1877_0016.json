They found that the residual charge is proportional to the exciting charge and that superposition of simultaneous forces applies to the phenomena of residual charge. The study also investigated the effects of different charging times and glass types on the residual charge and potential of Leyden jars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
