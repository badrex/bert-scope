The beehive consists of two stacked compartments, with a sliding shutter to cover the entrance and windows for ventilation. A knife can be inserted through a hole to cut the honeycombs without harming the bees. This design enables efficient honey collection and helps maintain a healthy bee population.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
