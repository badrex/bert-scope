The micrometer works by using two segments of a spherical glass, each forming an image of the object being observed. By adjusting the position of the segments, the images can be made to coincide, allowing for precise angle measurements. This innovation revolutionized the field of astronomy and telescope design.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
