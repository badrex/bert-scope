They observed that the properties of substances in regard to color changes could be determined by noticing the absorption curves and bands. The author also studied the effects of heat on solutions of hydrated salts and the formation of crystal hydrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Constitution and Analysis"}
