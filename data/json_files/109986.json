The author, Dr. John Brinkley, aimed to determine the source of differences between Greenwich and Dublin observations. He found that the absolute difference between the two sets of observations was only about one second, and concluded that the discordances could be seen as a testament to the precision of modern observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
