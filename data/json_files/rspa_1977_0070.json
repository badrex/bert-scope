They found that alumina is an active catalyst for hydrogen-deuterium exchange only above 500 K, but when chromium ions are introduced, activity at 500 K and above increases. A new zone of catalytic activity is generated at 110-350 K, which is specific to the presence of chromium. The catalytic activity is not a monotonic function of chromium content, and the activity per chromium ion exhibits a periodic variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
