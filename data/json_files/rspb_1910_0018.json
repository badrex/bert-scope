They find that the liver is hypertrophied in all cases, while the weight of the alimentary canal remains within or near the normal ratio. The study provides important insights into cancer metabolism and suggests promising directions for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Research"}
