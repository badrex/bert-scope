The machine can project harpoons with greater force and accuracy, potentially increasing the success rate of whale hunting. The author also discusses the anatomy of fish, particularly their hearing organs, and experiments on sound propagation under water.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
