J. Johnston's concise calculus for expressing electrodynamic relations. The author explores the invariance of the calculus and its independence of special systems of reference, considering the implications for space and time. The text also touches upon the representation of electromagnetic fields and the potential role of local deformation of space in the understanding of universal gravitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
