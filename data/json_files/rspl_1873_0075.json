They found that coniferine undergoes fermentation to form a crystalline product, which they identified as the same compound responsible for the aroma of vanilla. The transformation process involves several chemical reactions and the formation of ethylic ether and aldehyde compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
