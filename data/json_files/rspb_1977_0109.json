They discovered that only about 80% of particles were rapidly removed, while 20% were cleared with a mean half-time of 16 hours. Approximately 1% of particles remained in the tracheal tissue for at least 30 days. This retention could be a basis for effects of inhaled toxic particles on the large airways.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Health"}
