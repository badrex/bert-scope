The researchers found that complete oxidation occurs at low temperatures, and the initial products transform continuously into stable polymorphic forms through several intermediate structures. The study provides insights into the rearrangement of structure elements during the oxidation process and the formation of domain structures in the final products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid state chemistry"}
