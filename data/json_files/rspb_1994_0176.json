The study shows that a trypanosome parasite, Crithidia bombi, can be horizontally transmitted within bumblebee populations through the shared use of flowers. Floral characteristics, such as nectar availability and inflorescence architecture, may also affect transmission rates. This suggests that pollinator strategies could be influenced by the risk of contracting pathogens in addition to energetic considerations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
