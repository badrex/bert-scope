The crystal structure of a ternary complex containing MgATP and a 20-residue inhibitor peptide reveals the role of conserved residues at the active site. The enzyme is regulated through covalent modifications and high-affinity binding of protein inhibitors. Understanding the structure and function of this enzyme is essential for studying cellular signaling and growth control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
