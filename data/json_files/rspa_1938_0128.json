The authors discovered intense, discrete bands in the spectra, which are similar to resonance bands of alkyl halides. They found that the ionization potential increases as they go to lighter halogen atoms. The study also revealed that the excited electron in these molecules is non-bonding, and the potential energy curve of the excited state closely resembles that of the ground state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
