This research focused on the embryonic development, formation of the primary epithelium, and the role of the yolk and yolk cells in the process. The findings provide insights into the general problem of how the germ-layer theory applies to insects and contribute to the understanding of head segmentation in arthropods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
