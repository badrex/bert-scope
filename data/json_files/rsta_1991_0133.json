They analyze two primary flows and their stability, identifying three categories of evolution for infinitesimal disturbances. The study provides insights into the mechanism of periodical production of upstream-advancing waves and confirms the predictions obtained analytically for various regimes through numerical simulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics > Solitary Waves"}
