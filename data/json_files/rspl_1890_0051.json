The author presents evidence from various studies and species, suggesting that genital ducts are likely modified nephridia in Oligochaeta. This research contributes to the understanding of the reproductive and excretory systems in these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
