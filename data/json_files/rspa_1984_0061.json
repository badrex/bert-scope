They used the complete Navier-Stokes equations to describe the thermomechanical response of the gas near the boundary and found that the power density in the conduction layer determines shock strength. The results provide a rational basis for the piston analogies used by earlier authors and show the importance of power as a crucial factor in shock wave strength.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
