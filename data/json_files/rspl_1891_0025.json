They extend the results from previous work on plane curves to surfaces, considering rational and integral equations of coordinates and parameters. The author identifies various types of singular points and lines, such as conic nodes, binodal lines, and unodal lines, and explains how they are connected to the discriminant of the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
