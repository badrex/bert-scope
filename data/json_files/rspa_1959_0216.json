The first experiment uses the plasma dielectric method to measure electron density, while the second experiment employs an automatic mass spectrometer for ionic mass analysis. These methods have potential applications in space research and satellite instrumentation. The authors also discuss the potential of satellite installations to store and transmit data for further analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Physics"}
