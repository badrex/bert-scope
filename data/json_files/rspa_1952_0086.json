The authors calculate the average dimensions of a chain with interactions using a statistical method and examine the pair distribution function governing the probability of the distance between chain elements. They apply the theory to real-world systems, such as polystyrene-butanone, polystyrene-toluene, and polyisobutylene-cyclohexane, to demonstrate its practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
