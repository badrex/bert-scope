They found that the rate and lifetime of the reaction increase during the process, with a significant decrease in the overall energy of activation between 15% and 25% conversion. The intensity exponent also changes during the reaction, providing insights into the mechanism and kinetics of the gel stage of polymerization reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer chemistry"}
