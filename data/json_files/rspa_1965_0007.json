They use a theorem to generalize the displacement eigenfunctions for one-dimensional chains and apply direct numerical techniques to determine the spectra. The study provides insights into the behavior of atomic vibrations in disordered systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
