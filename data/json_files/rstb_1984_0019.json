The authors explain that bone necrosis is associated with work in compressed air and diving, and it can lead to serious damage and disability in joints. The condition is more common in divers who have more experience and dive deeper, but its exact cause remains unclear. Research continues to understand the mechanisms involved and to quantify the risks taken by commercial divers.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Orthopedics and Sports Medicine"}
