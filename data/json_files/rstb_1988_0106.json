It explores the complexities involved in producing appropriate models for trypanosomatid parasites like Leishmania and Trypanosoma, which often have multiple vertebrate hosts and can be fatal to humans. The article highlights the importance of animal reservoirs in maintaining human diseases and the interaction between human and vector dynamics in causing epidemic cycles, low-level endemic equilibria, or disease extinction.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
