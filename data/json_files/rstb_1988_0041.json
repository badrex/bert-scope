They discover a unique mitochondrial gene, wr/13-T, in the sterile maize that causes the sterility trait and susceptibility to a fungal pathogen. Two nuclear restorer genes, Rfi and Rf2, counteract the sterility trait and restore pollen production. The 13 kDa protein encoded by the wr/13-T gene is responsible for conferring sensitivity to T-toxin and methomyl, which inhibit mitochondrial respiration in the sterile maize.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Science"}
