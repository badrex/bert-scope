Davy, conducted experiments to determine the composition of phosphoric acid and its combinations with other elements. He discovered a new method for burning phosphorus in a gaseous state in a great excess of oxygen, which he considered the most accurate method for ascertaining the composition of phosphoric acid. He also studied the proportional volume in which chlorine combines with phosphorus and found that it is to the volume of oxygen as 2 to 1.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions"}
