It proposes a new model that considers the trade-off between reproductive rate and mate quality, showing that the sex with greater variation in mate quality will be the more choosy sex. This approach challenges the assumption that competition and choice are opposite sex roles and highlights the importance of considering variation in mate quality when predicting the direction of mate choice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
