The observations include daily measurements of barometer, temperature, wind direction, and weather conditions. The results are compared with previous observations and conclusions drawn from Dr. Adolph Erman's work, showing agreement in the placement of maximum barometric pressure in lat. 35\u00b0.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
