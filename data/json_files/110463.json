They found that the tricuspid valve does not completely prevent the reflux of blood from the ventricle into the auricle on the right side. The author suggests that this imperfect valvular function is an adaptation to prevent excessive blood flow to the lungs and is advantageous in early stages of right ventricle enlargement. Similar adjustments in other animals were also observed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
