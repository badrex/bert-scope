They divide the ionosphere into a transition region and a reflecting region and provide a solution for the case of oblique incidence, which is valid for very long waves. The study aims to provide a more satisfactory basis for the theoretical interpretation of measurements made at short and medium distances from a very long wave transmitter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
