They used a balance and calorimeter to measure the weight changes in a substance as it was heated. The experiments showed a large apparent increase in weight after heating, which they attributed to the decrease in buoyancy of the air due to the escape of heat. To reduce this effect, they performed further experiments in a partial vacuum. The results provided insights into the relationship between temperature and weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
