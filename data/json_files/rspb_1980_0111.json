The insect forms flotillas on the water surface and feeds on dead insect prey floating on the sea. The aggregation behavior is influenced by tidal cycles and environmental features, such as mangrove edges and lava deposits. The insect's feeding strategy helps it avoid predators and maintain its position on the water surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
