They found that at long wavelengths, the effect is independent of the semiconductor band structure and depends on the radiation pressure in the dielectric. The results support Minkowski's original expression for radiation momentum. This research provides additional experimental information on radiation pressure and contributes to the understanding of the photon drag effect in refractive media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
