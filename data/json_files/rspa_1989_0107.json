The authors provide a method to calculate the transition value of the Kamenetskii parameter, which helps in understanding the behavior of exothermic reactions with distributed temperatures. The results can be applied to various geometries and boundary conditions, offering a more efficient way to analyze thermal ignition problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Thermodynamics"}
