They discovered that factors such as vacuum, electrical power, resistance, distance between cathode and anti-cathode, and cathode size affect the penetrative value of X-rays. The author also found that X-rays are more penetrative when the average velocity of the molecules and the difference of potential between them and the anti-cathode are higher.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
