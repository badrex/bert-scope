They found that their values agreed closely with those of Rogers for the lines measured by him. The energies were calculated using weighted mean values of e/m and c, and the error in the energies was approximately 1 part in 10^3. This research helped improve the accuracy of determining nuclear levels and energy differences in radium isotopes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
