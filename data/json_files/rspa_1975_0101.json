They found that aromatic hydrocarbons can form soot through two different routes: direct condensation reactions or decomposition into small non-aromatic species before forming soot. The study also focused on the coagulation rate of soot particles and its relation to the self-preserving size distribution characteristic of free-molecule coagulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Aerosol Science"}
