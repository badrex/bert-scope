They found that the implanted skin initially showed rapid cell division, but over time, the epithelium reduced in amount and eventually became scarce. The study also discovered that dead epithelial cells attract polynuclear leucocytes, which is not due to bacterial contamination. This research provides insights into tissue regeneration and wound healing processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
