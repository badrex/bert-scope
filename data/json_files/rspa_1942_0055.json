The derivation considers the symmetrized level surfaces and the ellipticity of the Earth, providing a clearer understanding of the equations' terms and their applicability to both deep and shallow layers. The author also explains the role of non-periodic gravitational potential in tidal problems and discusses the advantages of the new derivation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
