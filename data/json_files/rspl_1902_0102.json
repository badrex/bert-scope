The author uses Zorawski's method to simplify the solution of partial differential equations and transform them into the partial differential equations of the system of concomitants of a set of simultaneous binary forms. The algebraic expressions of the invariants up to a certain order are obtained, and their geometric significance is investigated.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
