They found that the needle's direction was affected when the Aurora's fringes reached the plane of the dip, providing evidence that the needle is not influenced by the Aurora until it is in this specific position. This discovery helps explain the conflicting results from previous observers and offers a better understanding of the relationship between the Aurora Borealis and the Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
