The earthquake's characteristics, such as weak long waves, early supplementary phases, and abnormal focal depths, are discussed. The findings contribute to the understanding of deep focus earthquakes and their impact on the Earth's interior.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
