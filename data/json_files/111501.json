W. Hofmann, investigates the reaction between aniline and bichloride of carbon, resulting in the formation of a new base. The new base, which can be used as a colorant, is synthesized through a complex process involving multiple steps and chemical transformations. The author also discusses the constitution of the new compound and its relation to other phenyl-based diamines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
