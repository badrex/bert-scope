They named this new substance Acetate of Sycoceryl and studied its chemical properties. They also found a parasitical body accompanying the substance, which they managed to remove. The authors analyzed the composition of Acetate of Sycoceryl and its chemical reactions with other substances, such as chloride of benzoyl and chloride of othyl.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
