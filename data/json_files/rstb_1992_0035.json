The authors present data from two Forest Reserves in South-east Asia, Tekam in Peninsular Malaysia and Ulu Segama in Sabah, to show how ecological analysis can be used to quantify the impact of logging on the forest and its recovery. The results suggest that some species may take longer to respond to environmental changes, and monitoring is needed to determine long-term trends.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
