The authors explore how these factors influence the specification of neuronal phenotypes and the mechanisms by which neurotrophins may act in this context. They also examine the heterogeneity of sensory neurons and the impact of neurotrophins on their development and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
