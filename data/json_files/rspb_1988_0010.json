The results show that isoprenaline speeds up tension repriming, while reducing extracellular calcium slows it down. Increases in stimulation rate enhance tension repriming in a control medium but this rate-dependence is absent in the presence of isoprenaline. Isoprenaline abolishes post-extrasystolic potentiation, and a reduced calcium supply partly restores it. These findings suggest that isoprenaline affects the degree of sarcoplasmic reticulum filling and the rate of calcium recycling within these stores.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
