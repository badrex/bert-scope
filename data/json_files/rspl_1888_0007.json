These compounds are unstable and have unique properties, such as being deliquescent, soluble in alcohol, and volatile at ordinary temperatures. The authors also compared the properties of these compounds to those formed by sulfur trioxide and ammonia.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
