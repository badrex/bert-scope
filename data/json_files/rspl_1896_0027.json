The method involves cooling distilled water below freezing, inserting the thermometer, and then adding a crystal of ice to initiate freezing. The final temperature is maintained within one or two ten-thousandths of a degree for an hour at a time. This method improves upon existing techniques and allows for more consistent results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
