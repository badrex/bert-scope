They explain that during the Proterozoic era, continental crust behaved as a non-rigid body, with smaller, more numerous rigid blocks surrounded by mobile belts. The author also explores the connection between changes in the Earth's core and mantle and the appearance of granitic rocks during specific periods in the Earth's history."}
