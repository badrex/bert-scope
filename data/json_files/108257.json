He discovered that the barometrical mean is depressed when the moon is in south declination and that there is a gradual depression as the moon moves from north declination to the equator. This suggests the existence of a large atmospheric tidal wave or swell caused by the moon's attraction. The study also found a cycle of 18 years in which the mean weight of the atmosphere increases and decreases.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
