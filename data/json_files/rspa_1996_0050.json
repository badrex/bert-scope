They use Hertz potential methods to derive a covariant equation that admits separable solutions for all components. The key to understanding the mechanism of separation lies in the existence of a Killing-Yano tensor, which is crucial to the description of the explicit solutions obtained in a Kerr spacetime background for spin wave fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
