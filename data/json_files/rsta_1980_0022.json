The authors found that the heat flow over the continental margin is lower than over the adjacent Western European continental area, suggesting different radioactive crustal contributions to the surface heat flow in the two areas. This information provides constraints on the debate about the nature of crustal thinning processes under the margin.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
