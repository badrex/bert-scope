He discovered the properties of subarseniate and subphosphate of soda, which are subsesquisalts containing one and a half proportions of base to one of acid. He also found that the acid of the subphosphate of soda is not convertible into pyrophosphoric acid by heat, unlike the acid of the common phosphate of soda. Graham analyzed the composition of various salts and discussed the atomic weight of arsenic, which was deduced by Berzelius from his analysis of arsenious acid by sulfur.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
