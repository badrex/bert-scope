Matthiessen, investigates the electrical conducting power of alloys and classifies them into three groups based on their composition. They observe that alloys with metals from class A and B have distinct conducting power curves. The author also discusses the physical properties of these alloys and their relationship to their conducting power. Some alloys are found to be chemical combinations, while others are mechanical mixtures. The study provides insights into the factors affecting the electrical conductivity of alloys and the role of physical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
