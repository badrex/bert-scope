The radicals were produced by flash photolysis of NH3 and N2H4. A detailed study of the isotope shifts suggests that the molecule has a linear configuration in the excited state and that the spectrum consists of a long progression of the bending vibration in this state. The spectra consist of type C bands for which the transition moment is perpendicular to the plane of the molecule. The authors also analyzed the rotational and vibrational structure of the spectra, providing insights into the excited state's complex vibronic structure and the significance of the short bond length.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
