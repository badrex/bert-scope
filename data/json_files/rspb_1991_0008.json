They propose a modified series-parallel model of the sodium channel to explain the disagreement between macroscopic and single-channel studies. The study concludes that the inactivation gate carries around 1.3 units of electronic charge and discusses the implications for voltage-gated ion channel models.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
