They found that the nerves contained both medullated and non-medullated fibers, which connected to the alveolar wall and formed a plexus of nerve fibrils. The study also discovered that nerve cells were abundant in the lung, with both straight and spiral processes. This research provided a detailed understanding of the frog's lung's nerve structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
