The islands have a disharmonic and impoverished terrestrial fauna, with a high incidence of endemism. The biogeographical relationships of the fauna are partly obscured by this endemism, making it difficult to determine their origins. The flora is also limited, with only 39 species of flowering plants and 27 ferns on Gough Island. The article highlights the need for further quantitative studies and investigations of the energy-exchange systems among the few interacting species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
