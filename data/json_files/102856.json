The assembly discussed the observations made by Monsieur Cassini on the Earth's shape and the passage of the Meridian Line. Cassini's observations led to the discovery of the inequality of the degrees of the Meridian on the Earth, which challenges the idea of the Earth's perfect roundness. The letter also mentions the opinions of other scientists, such as Huygens and Newton, on the Earth's shape and the use of pendulums in determining it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
