This method allows for the systematic construction of spectral equations and simplifies the evaluation of integrals of products of three tensor harmonics. The article demonstrates the application of these new tensor harmonics to various partial differential equations in mathematical physics, such as the Laplace and Helmholtz equations, stress-strain equations, and fluid mechanics equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
