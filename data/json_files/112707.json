He discovered a critical point at 30\u00b0C where carbonic acid ceases to liquefy by pressure. Andrews found that the transition between the gaseous and liquid states can be made continuous, with no interruption or breach of continuity. This research sheds light on the continuity of matter and the behavior of other substances like nitrous oxide, hydrochloric acid, ammonia, and sulfur compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
