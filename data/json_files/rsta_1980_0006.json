The study focuses on a parallel free shear layer with a hyperbolic tangent velocity profile at high Reynolds numbers, providing insight into the transition process of free shear layers and the mechanisms governing the development of orderly structures in fully turbulent flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
