They discovered that the proportionate diminution of amplitude is independent of the amplitude, and the logarithmic decrement of amplitude increases with the length of the vibration period. The authors also found that permanent molecular strain, rapid fluctuations of temperature, and wire-drawing can affect the internal friction and torsional elasticity of metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
