The research confirms discrepancies between experimental data and existing theories, questioning the role of specular reflection in gas flow. The findings contribute to a better understanding of gas behavior in capillaries and have implications for various applications, such as gas separation and analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
