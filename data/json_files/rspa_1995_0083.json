Two versions of the source method are developed to find a solution, ensuring the existence of unique solutions. The study focuses on the fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics of the problem, providing insights into the behavior of the fluid around a surface-piercing body.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
