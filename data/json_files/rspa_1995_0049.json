They identified three distinct mixing regimes: laminar, convective-mixing, and diffusive-mixing. The study examined the effects of viscosity, molecular diffusion, and compressibility on the mixing process and provided insights into the growth and decay of the mixing layer.", "scientific_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics > Mixing Layers"}
