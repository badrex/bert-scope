The tapetum is a white reflector located in the pigment epithelium and is responsible for reflexion of light. It has a high refractive index and is composed of membrane-bound tapetal spheres that enclose the tapetal pigment. The tapetum's reflectance is highest at 500 nm and is useful for catfishes living in turbid waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
