The size of the resulting larvae decreases when exposed to abnormal temperatures, with the effect diminishing over time as the larvae develop. This research highlights the importance of environmental factors in the growth and development of organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Environmental and Earth Sciences"}
