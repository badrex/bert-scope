This method provided detailed measurements of velocity variation with time, allowing the calculation of fracture energies and impact fracture toughness. The results support the theory of a thermal crack-blunting mechanism at short loading times.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
