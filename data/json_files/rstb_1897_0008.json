It covers the development of theories on nerve regeneration, the debate on whether nerves can heal by first intention, and the role of trophic centers in nerve nutrition. The article also highlights the importance of nerve suture and the early return of function after nerve section. It concludes that nerves, even when divided for a long time, can undergo early reunion under suitable conditions. The histological process of regeneration is discussed, with two main views presented: one that the peripheral segment of the nerve does not participate in regeneration, and another that regeneration occurs through the growth of new axis-cylinders from the central segment."}
