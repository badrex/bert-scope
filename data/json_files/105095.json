Smeaton, presents a new tackle design that combines two existing methods to improve the efficiency and power of lifting heavy weights. The new design allows for more pullies in one block, reduces friction, and increases the height that weights can be raised. This invention has potential applications for merchants, seamen, builders, engineers, and more.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical engineering"}
