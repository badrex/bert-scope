The authors consider four cases, including drops trapped between horizontal planes, drops trapped between a horizontal plane and their homophase, and drops on top of other drops approaching a horizontal plane or their homophase. They found that the coalescence time increases with additional vertical force, as the area of the draining film becomes greater. This implies that the film beneath an undisturbed drop will rupture quicker than when a vertical force presses upon the drop.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
