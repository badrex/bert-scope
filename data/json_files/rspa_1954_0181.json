The authors develop a theoretical solution for the temperature distribution in the steady state, considering both finite and infinitely long rods. They discuss Stead's formula and its applicability to long rods, ultimately deriving an additive relation for the temperature distribution that fits with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Heat Transfer"}
