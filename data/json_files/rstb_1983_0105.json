It discusses the correlations between phytochrome levels and physiological responses, as well as the different types of relations observed between Pfr concentration and response. The author highlights the high sensitivity to changes in Pfr at low levels and the variety of relations between Pfr and response, suggesting that the concept of Pfr as the only active form of phytochrome may need reevaluation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
