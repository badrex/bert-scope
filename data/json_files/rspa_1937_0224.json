They consider the effects of solar radiation, water vapor, ozone, and molecular oxygen on the temperature and absorption rates, providing graphs and tables to help understand the complex interactions. This study supports the idea that the highest possible daytime equilibrium temperature in the upper atmosphere is around 3300K, and the actual temperature can vary depending on the concentrations of different gases."}
