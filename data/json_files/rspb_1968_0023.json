Researchers found that calcitonin is a thyroid hormone and has a significant impact on bone resorption, leading to a decrease in plasma calcium levels. The hormone has been purified and its mode of action on bone resorption has been investigated, providing insights into its role in maintaining calcium balance in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
