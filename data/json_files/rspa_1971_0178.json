They found that aluminium halides intercalate into graphite, forming compounds with increased electrical conductivity. The authors also investigated the role of additional halogen in the intercalation process and discussed the implications of these findings for solid state chemistry and the behavior of synthetic metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid State Chemistry"}
