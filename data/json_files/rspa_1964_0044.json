They found that the adsorption isotherms show three discontinuities with increasing electrolyte concentration, indicating the inability of electrolyte to penetrate into three surface regions. The results suggest that two layers of water provide the bulk of the energy for intercrystalline swelling common to all clays.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
