They analyze the effects of dielectric media on the propagation of electromagnetic waves and discuss various cases of electric currents in the sphere. The study simplifies calculations by assuming an infinite velocity of propagation in the surrounding medium, which is suitable for practical applications. The findings contribute to the understanding of electromagnetic phenomena and their applications in fields like telecommunication.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
