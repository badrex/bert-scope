L. Jinks and K. Mather examines the stability in development of heterozygotes and homozygotes in various species. They found that heterozygotes generally show less variation and have greater stability in development than homozygotes. This can be attributed to the action of natural selection in outbreeding populations, which favors heterozygous genotypes. The authors argue that greater stability in development is a result of genic balance and not a characteristic of the heterozygotic state itself. They also discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the genetic structure and response to selection in both wild and domesticated populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
