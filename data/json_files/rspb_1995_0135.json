The results reveal a widespread neuronal localization for S2 in the digestive system, with separate localization for S1 and S2 immunoreactivity. These findings suggest a role for these neuropeptides in the starfish digestive system, particularly in gut relaxation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
