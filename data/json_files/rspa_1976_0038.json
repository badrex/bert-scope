The results suggest that high fracture-toughness is achieved when the matrix yield strength is above a certain critical level, influenced by the fiber's mechanical properties and volume fraction. The fracture-toughness of a strongly bonded composite with adequate matrix yield strength is likely to be greater than that achieved by a fiber-matrix debonding mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
