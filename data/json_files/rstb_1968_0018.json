The study includes the analysis of organically rich deposits, fauna, and flora, which help to understand the climate of Middle and Late Pleistocene times. The research also highlights the importance of radiocarbon dating in determining the age of deposits and the correlation between different terraces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Stratigraphy"}
