The new polymer reduces rolling resistance while enhancing wet grip, leading to better overall tyre performance. Extensive laboratory and vehicle testing confirmed the effectiveness of the new polymer, which was introduced into commercial tyres in 1981.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tire Technology"}
