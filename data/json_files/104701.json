This unique material has a higher specific gravity than gold and silver, and it resists the purification process of cupellation. It has various properties, such as being hard, compact, and not easily melted. The author suggests further inquiry into its nature and potential uses, as it may have unique qualities similar to other metallic substances like the magnet, iron, antimony, and mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
