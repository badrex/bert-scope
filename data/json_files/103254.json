Hauksbee, conducted experiments to study the spontaneous ascent of water in various conditions, such as in small tubes, between glass planes, and in a vacuum. He found that the figure of the vessel, the presence of air, and the quantity of matter did not contribute to the phenomenon. Hauksbee compared the results to the behavior of magnets and their attraction, suggesting a possible connection between the two. He also conducted an experiment with a glass tube filled with ashes to further explore the ascent of water, observing the absorption of water by the ashes and the behavior of the surrounding air.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
