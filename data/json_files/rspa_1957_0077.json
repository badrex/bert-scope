They assume that the illuminated region and the penumbra of a body scatter independently at high frequencies, and they obtain scattering coefficients for perfectly reflecting convex bodies in plane electromagnetic and sound waves. The formulae involve only the scattering coefficients of the circular cylinder and the geometry of the shadow boundary.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
