It explores the structure-activity relationships and the modifications made to penicillin molecules to overcome resistance. The author highlights the importance of understanding these relationships to create new antibiotics with improved resistance against \u03b2-lactamase enzymes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Medicinal Chemistry"}
