This process is a dominant mechanism for crystal fractionation and helps in the formation of various types of igneous rocks. The authors argue that previous models of igneous petrogenesis, based on crystal settling, are inadequate and that convective fractionation should be considered the primary mechanism for magma differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Petrology"}
