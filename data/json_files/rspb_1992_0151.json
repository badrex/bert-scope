The most common class exhibits rapid flickering between open and closed states, while the second class has distinct open-close transitions. These findings suggest that the predominant form of the channel in vivo differs significantly from cloned channels and has more complex gating properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
