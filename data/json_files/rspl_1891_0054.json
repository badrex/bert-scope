They used a combination of the method of cooling and a new method to measure stress, allowing them to measure stress and strain for ethyl alcohol up to a tension of over 17 atmospheres. The results showed that stress and absolute strain were proportional, and the absolute coefficient of elasticity was constant within the limits of observational error.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
