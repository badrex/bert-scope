It highlights that most of the atmospheric N2O comes from microbial activities at the Earth's surface, with oceans being the major source. The article also emphasizes the potential threat N2O poses to the ozone layer and the need to understand its cycle for environmental protection.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
