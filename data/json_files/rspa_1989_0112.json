The authors examine various velocity models and find growing magnetic fields for specific flow conditions, which helps explain the lack of success in earlier investigations. The study confirms and extends the results of previous authors, covering non-steady fields, different values of magnetic Reynolds numbers, and other parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
