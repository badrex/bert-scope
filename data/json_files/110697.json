He conducted experiments in the East Indies to test the solubility of silica by steam, building upon previous failed attempts by Dr. Turner and others. Jeffreys believed that the key factor in his success was the high temperature, which allowed for the solution of silica by steam.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Materials Science"}
