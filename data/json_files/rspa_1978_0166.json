They examine cases where the wave amplitudes are functions of two spatial coordinates and time, and explore the behavior of localized wave packets in the presence of a larger pump wave. This research has applications in plasma physics, nonlinear optics, electrical and mechanical oscillations, and fluid mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
