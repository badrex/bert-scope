They propose a thermal theory to explain the anisotropy in abrasion resistance, suggesting that high sliding speeds introduce a thermally activated chemical effect. The author also studies the friction between diamond surfaces and examines the tracks produced by sliding diamond on diamond, providing evidence supporting the thermal abrasion mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
