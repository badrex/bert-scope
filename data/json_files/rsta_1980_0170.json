It explores various classical and quantum processes that might shape the irregularity spectrum on large cosmic scales and examines the likely fate of adiabatic, isothermal, and vortical fluctuations in a hot, big-bang universe. The article also reviews different physical processes operating during the first million years and their potential impact on the irregularity spectrum emerging at the recombination era.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
