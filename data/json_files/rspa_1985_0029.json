They observed direct interstitial jumps, collinear interstitialcy migration, and [110] vacancy jumps, and analyzed the time dependence of mean square displacements to understand defect migration mechanisms. This research provides insights into the ionic transport in fast-ion conductors and the behavior of Frenkel defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
