The frequency and magnitude of disturbances depend on the hour of the day, the time of year, and the year of observation. The study suggests that the main causes of annual disturbances are not dependent on local seasons. The author also finds that disturbances tend to be more frequent and larger during the day than at night, and that the disturbances' mean effect is a constant westerly effect at both St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
