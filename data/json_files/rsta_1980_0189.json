The authors find that as the width of the estuary increases, the longitudinal dispersion coefficient eventually reduces from a value associated with the transverse of the tidal current to a much smaller value associated with the vertical shear. The study reveals that the most marked effects of buoyancy are found in wide estuaries, where the buoyancy-enhanced transverse mixing has increased importance to the transverse shear, leading to larger values of the longitudinal dispersion rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Estuaries and Coastal Systems"}
