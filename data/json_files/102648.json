He suggests subtracting ten days from the Roman calendar and provides a new calendar form for May to August without changing any feast or holy day. The proposal also includes a table for determining moveable feasts, which can be used for a hundred or two hundred years. Dee recommends that the reform be published with the approval of the council and the archbishops and bishops.", "scientific_discipline": "History of Science > Astronomy"}
