He observed a significant relationship between air temperature and the daily quantity of urea excreted, with a constant increase up to 70 degrees Celsius and a decrease beyond that point. This research helped establish the physiological limit of the tropical zone and provided insights into the influence of temperature on human metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
