The approach involves using a combination of lenses and mirrors, with the main challenge being to find the appropriate distribution of curvatures between the lenses. The solution is achieved through a series of approximations and calculations, resulting in a system that effectively corrects for spherical aberration, coma, and field curvature while keeping astigmatism within narrow limits.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optical engineering"}
