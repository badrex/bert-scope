They found that this method can be applied to study the developmental mechanics of young fowl blastoderms and provided some results from their preliminary study. The technique allowed them to observe the formation of endoderm and mesoderm in birds, which differs from the process in amphibians.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
