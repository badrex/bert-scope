The authors found that the observed mean values of maximum hourly average surface concentrations exhibit a marked dependence on wind speed, with the lowest concentrations occurring in light winds. They also proposed practical methods for predicting the distribution of concentrations and discussed the variations in axial concentration, crosswind standard deviation, and concentration integrated across wind in terms of departures from the isotropic Gaussian concentration distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
