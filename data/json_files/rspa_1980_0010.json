The authors develop a model that considers deformation faults occurring in a specific manner to statistically create the desired structure. They predict observable diffraction effects, such as reflexions with different properties, and provide expressions for the integrated intensity, peak shift, integral breadth, and asymmetry of these reflexions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
