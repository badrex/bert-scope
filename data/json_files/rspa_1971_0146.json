The author proves the existence of solutions for the boundary-value problem when the suction parameter is close to zero and extends the existence theorem for all values of the parameter, with the restriction that the suction and blowing values at the disk must be of the same sign.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
