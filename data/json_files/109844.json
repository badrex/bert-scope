The lamp can be used in explosive mixtures of fire-damp and air, as the wire gauze prevents the flame from igniting the surrounding gas. This invention significantly improves safety for coal miners working in hazardous environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mining Technology"}
