They discovered that pollen grains store reserve materials, such as carbohydrates, which are used during germination. The authors also found evidence of enzymes, like diastase and invertase, in pollen grains, which play a role in breaking down complex sugars and starches for the plant's nutrition. This research helps us understand how plants reproduce and how pollen grains provide nutrients to the developing plant.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
