Surprisingly, these mice can still mount cytotoxic T cell responses and have a reduced but functional humoral response. A new population of MHC class II-restricted CD4-CD8+ T cells has emerged, which can substitute for the role of CD4+ lymphocytes. This discovery has important implications for understanding immunodeficiency and disease situations where CD4 cells are decreased or absent.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
