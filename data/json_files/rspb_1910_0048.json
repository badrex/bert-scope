They found that the blood volume can be accurately calculated using the formula B = W, where B is the blood volume in cubic centimeters, W is the animal's weight in grams, and k is a constant specific to each species. This formula shows that smaller animals have a relatively greater blood volume compared to their body weight, and it is misleading to express blood volume as a percentage of body weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
