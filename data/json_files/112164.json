Story Maskelyne, discovered two new minerals, Langite and Waringtonite, found in Cornwall. Langite is a blue mineral with a prismatic system, while Waringtonite is a green mineral with a unique crystallography. The author describes their physical properties, chemical composition, and how they form in relation to the surrounding Killas and vein-stone. The discovery of these minerals contributes to the understanding of the geological and mineralogical composition of Cornwall.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Mineralogy"}
