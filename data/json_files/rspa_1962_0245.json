They found that the scale height decreased greatly between 1957 and 1961, likely due to a decline in solar activity. The methods provide a more accurate way to determine air density without needing to know the satellite's cross-sectional area.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
