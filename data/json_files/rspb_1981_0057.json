By studying the biochemical changes in the chick's brain during imprinting, the author identifies the role of the hyperstriatum ventrale in the storage process. The results provide insights into the neural basis of memory and the potential for further analysis of imprinting and learning mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
