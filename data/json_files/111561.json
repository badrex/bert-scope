The author found that nitrogenous foods, such as milk, sugar, and tea, increase the amount of carbonic acid exhaled, while starch, fat, and some alcohols have a lesser effect. The findings suggest that certain foods can be classified as \"excito-respiratory,\" influencing the body's respiratory and metabolic processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nutrition and Metabolism"}
