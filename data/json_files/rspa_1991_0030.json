They constructed an asymptotic solution that showed the energy density near the crack tip in the material with the largest hardening parameter. The solution in the other material also showed a stress singularity, and the overall near-crack-tip solution was part of a one-parameter family of solutions. This work helps in understanding the behavior of bimaterial interfaces and aids in fracture analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
