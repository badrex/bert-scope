Upon examining the boy's body, the author discovered a substance resembling lung vessels that had been coughed up. The author theorizes that this substance was formed from mucilaginous humor produced by the trachea glands, which hardened due to the dryness of the air and the boy's illness. This observation challenges the belief that one can cough up the blood vessels of their lungs.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pulmonology"}
