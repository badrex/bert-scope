The analysis reveals that the stem's small procambial diameter, in comparison to its overall diameter, and the presence of large multifascicular leaf bases are significant features. The study provides insights into the growth forms and selective forces that shaped the early radiation of gymnosperms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
