The authors measured the electron magnetic resonance of impurity ions in the host compound and determined the value of the internal field acting on each impurity ion. They found that the exchange field values did not conform to a simple model based on isotropic exchange interaction between the lanthanide ions' real electron spins. This research provides insights into the magnetic properties of lanthanide ions in antiferromagnetic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
