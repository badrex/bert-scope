They found that the magnetic anisotropy is sensitive to the anisotropy in the high-frequency term of susceptibility expressions, enabling them to assign the disputed ligand field transitions. The study also discussed the nature of chemical bonding and exchange interactions in the compound.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
