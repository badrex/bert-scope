The compound is oxidized by tyrosinase, generating reactive orthoquinones with cytotoxic potential. These cytotoxic compounds may damage melanocytes, leading to the death of cancer cells. The author suggests that this mechanism could be a promising approach to the specific chemotherapy of malignant melanoma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Research"}
