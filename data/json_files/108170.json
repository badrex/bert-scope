The author examines the establishment of each place and the semimenstrual inequality, as well as the diurnal inequality of heights and times. The author discovers a large diurnal inequality of the times at Bassadore, amounting to over two hours in some instances, which is a new and curious tidal feature.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
