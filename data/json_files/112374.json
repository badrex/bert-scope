The author compares these fossils with existing species of Equus and previously defined fossil species of Equidae. The study reveals that the fossils belong to a species or well-marked race within the true Horses, which were smaller than the average-sized horse of the present period. The author also discusses the evidence of the people who inhabited the cave and hunted these wild horses for food.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
