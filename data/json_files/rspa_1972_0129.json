The results confirm the existence of resonant scattering by ions at specific energy levels, supporting the dynamic Jahn-Teller theory. The findings also indicate the presence of strong coupled mode effects and provide insights into the nature of the ground state of chromium in an octahedral site.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
