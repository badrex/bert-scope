They discovered that plants absorb carbon dioxide during the day and release it at night, affecting the amount of carbon dioxide in the air. The author also developed a method to measure the total light absorbed by gases, vapors, and floating solids using iodide of potassium and nitric acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
