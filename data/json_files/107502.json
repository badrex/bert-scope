The author found that the great contraction of the channel between Dungeness and Cape D'Alpree causes the tides to accumulate, leading to higher tides in the area. This phenomenon is due to the resistance to the tidal flow caused by the sudden narrowing of the channel, which results in the formation of two large natural basins or reservoirs at each end of the straits.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Geography"}
