Despite their impressive magnification capabilities, the author finds them difficult to use and ultimately concludes that they are more of a curiosity than a useful tool. The author also discusses observations on plant reproduction and blood cells, but is unable to replicate the experiments due to the limitations of the microscope glasses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microscopy"}
