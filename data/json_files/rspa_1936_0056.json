The author introduces a system of teleparallelism and expands gravitational tensors in powers of the gravitational constant to provide a simple and explicit solution for the equations involved. The study aims to express the flux integral and the tensors as explicit functions of the potentials and their first derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
