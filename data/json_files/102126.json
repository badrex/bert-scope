He observes the presence of numerous blood vessels and transparent globules, which he believes play a role in the brain's function and appearance. Leewenhoek's detailed observations contribute to the understanding of brain anatomy and the role of blood vessels in the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
