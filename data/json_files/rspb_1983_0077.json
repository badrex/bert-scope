They introduce a 'fitness function' that takes into account group structure, local fitness functions, and average fitness functions for different phenotypes. This new framework allows for a reevaluation and reinterpretation of the Hamilton criterion for the evolution of altruism, providing a more comprehensive understanding of social behavior in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
