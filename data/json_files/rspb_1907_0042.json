They found that chitin from various sources had specific gravities ranging from 1.393 to 1.408 and refractive indices between 1.550 and 1.557. This method helps in determining the presence of chitin in different organisms and understanding its chemical composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
