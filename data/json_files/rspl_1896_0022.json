Norman Lockyer and his team conducted a comprehensive study of the spectra of various gases and minerals to identify unknown lines in their spectra. They found that the lines were diverse and suggested that some constituents of the gas mixture obtained from minerals might be absorbed by potash during the sparking process. This research helped in understanding the composition of minerals and the gases associated with them.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
