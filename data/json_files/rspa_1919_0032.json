The author proposes that a conducting layer in the upper atmosphere reflects electric waves, which affects the strength of the magnetic force at the Earth's surface. The study suggests that this phenomenon could make long-distance communication with planets like Mars or Venus difficult.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
