The machine uses a terrestrial globe, an index, a circular plate, a penumbra, and other components to show the eclipse's various appearances and times at different locations. This invention allowed for better understanding and prediction of solar eclipses.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
