This method is more reliable and robust than standard methods and is based on a new definition of fractal dimension particularly suited for graphs of functions. The variation method is validated with both fractal brownian surfaces and Takagi surfaces, giving more accurate results than classical algorithms. Finally, the authors apply the variation method to real, practical data: rough surfaces obtained by sand-blasting brass plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
