The authors found that the majority of ions in the flame are produced through direct production of electrons, and that the appearance of ions is consistent with dissociative attachment rather than three-body attachment. The study provides direct evidence on the nature and abundance of ionic species in flames, contributing to a better understanding of ionization mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
