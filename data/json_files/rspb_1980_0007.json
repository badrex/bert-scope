They found that these spikes are facilitated by Sr2+ or Ba2+ media and can be induced in all turtle cones, suggesting that every cone receives a feedback input from L-horizontal cells. This research provides insight into the mechanism and properties of feedback spikes in the visual processing of turtle cones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
