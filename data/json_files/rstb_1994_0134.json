It questions the use of a substantial discrepancy between language ability and non-verbal IQ in defining SLI and suggests that SLI may not be genetically distinct from less specific disorders where language impairment occurs in the context of low average or borderline non-verbal ability. The article also explores the heterogeneous language symptoms seen in SLI and whether they correspond to distinct conditions, different phenotypic manifestations of a common underlying disorder, or are merely random variations resulting from unreliable assessments.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Developmental Psychology"}
