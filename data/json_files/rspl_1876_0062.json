They discovered that the muscle-cylinder's properties do not follow Du Bois's \"law of the muscle-current.\" The author concludes that the part of the muscle nearest the tendon is negative, and the distribution of electrical tension on the natural surface is governed by a similar law in other muscles. This understanding helps explain the behavior of muscle-cylinders and their properties."}
