S. Hele-Shaw, introduces a new method of filtration using stream-line motion and thin films of viscous liquid. This method employs waterproof paper with a suitable surface texture to create channels for fluid flow, allowing for efficient separation of suspended particles and rapid filtration. The technique has potential applications in various fields, including environmental science and chemical engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry"}
