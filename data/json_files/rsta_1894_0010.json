They measured the transpiration times of various liquids and found that the viscosity increased with the boiling point of the liquid. This research helped to understand the connection between transpirability and molecular weight, and the influence of temperature on the flow of liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fluid dynamics"}
