The author demonstrates how RNA molecules can evolve resistance to inhibitors, such as ethidium bromide, through mutations. This in vitro system provides a model for understanding the evolution of haploid genomes under natural selection and has implications for theories of the origins of life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
