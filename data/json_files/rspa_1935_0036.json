They used various types of detonators and explosives, and measured the maximum effective gap lengths for detonation. The results showed that detonator efficiency and shock wave behavior are directional, and the authors discussed possible explanations for these findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Explosives and Propellants"}
