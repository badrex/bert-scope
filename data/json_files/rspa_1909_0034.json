They found that grinding the minerals releases more helium, but there is a limit to how much can be released, suggesting that the helium is trapped in structures larger than molecules. The finer the mineral particles, the more helium is released, but further research is needed to determine the exact size at which the remaining helium is liberated.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
