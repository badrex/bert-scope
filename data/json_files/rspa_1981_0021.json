The research focuses on the H chondrites and their parent asteroids, providing insights into the early thermal environments of meteorites and their parent bodies. The study also discusses the principle of the multiple-detector method used to analyze the fission track densities in meteorites.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Planetary Science"}
