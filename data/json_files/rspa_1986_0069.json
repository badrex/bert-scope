The authors demonstrate how a connection string and a scalar string can be combined to yield a sequence of tensors, and apply this construction to decompose the observed Bartlett adjustment into invariant terms. This work provides a general framework for representing various asymptotic expansions in invariant terms and has implications for statistical inference.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
