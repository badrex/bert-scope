They studied the emission from both glass tips and tubes, finding that the number of emitting sites increased with the applied field. The emitted particles were identified as electrons, and the authors proposed a model for field-enhanced thermionic emission from sites with low work function.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
