They used a modified Wheatstone bridge setup and encountered various challenges, such as thermoelectric currents, heating effects, and mechanical stress. Despite these difficulties, they were unable to observe any significant effect on the electrical resistance due to the ether drift or the contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
