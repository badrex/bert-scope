They emphasize the need for realistic models of molecular evolution and present methods for reconstructing phylogenetic trees based on these models. The authors also highlight the limitations of current stochastic models and suggest ways to refine or refute them using accumulating experimental information.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Evolution"}
