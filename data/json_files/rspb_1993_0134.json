They used the colonial green algae Volvox carteri and found that germ cells grew faster when associated with a soma, and the difference in growth rates increased with nutrient concentration. This supports the idea that division of labor between soma and germ cells offers a physiological advantage to multicellular organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
