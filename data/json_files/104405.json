The method involves using two trochars, one for injecting the medicinal liquid and the other for removing the dropsical lymph. This allows for continuous fluid exchange and prevents syncope from inanition. The height of the liquid can be adjusted to control the distension of the abdomen.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Surgery"}
