The proof demonstrates that the Kelvin relations are a direct consequence of symmetry relations and follow from the principle of microscopic reversibility. The author emphasizes the importance of treating the mutual interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations in a fully symmetrical way when formulating the theory of transport phenomena in conductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
