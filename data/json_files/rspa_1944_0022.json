The results showed that the scattering was isotropic in the center of mass system, with some evidence for a high-order periodic fluctuation in the angular distribution of scattered intensity. This research contributed to understanding the forces between neutrons and protons at close distances, which is crucial for the development of nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
