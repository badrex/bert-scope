The researchers found that the algae contained an active isocitrate lyase under all growth conditions, but the enzyme only participates in the glyoxylate cycle when incorporated into a particulate structure. This discovery challenges the assumption that the presence of isocitrate lyase in an organism is sufficient for the glyoxylate cycle to operate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Algae Metabolism"}
