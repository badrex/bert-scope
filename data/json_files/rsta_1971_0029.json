The authors derive a general equation to describe the spatio-temporal behavior of space charge in an ideal dielectric medium and apply it to a parallel plate capacitor with space charges near its electrodes. They discuss symmetrical and asymmetrical charge distributions and their effects on the potential difference and external current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
