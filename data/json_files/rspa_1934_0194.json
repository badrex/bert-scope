They find that the main features of large-angle inelastic scattering arise from the diffracting effects of the static potential fields of the normal and excited atoms on the incident and inelastically scattered electron waves. The results show good agreement with experimental data for higher voltages, but discrepancies are observed at lower voltages, possibly due to the neglect of electron exchange effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
