The continuous spectrum showed dark lines of Fraunhofer, and the bright lines belonged to the spectrum of carbon, possibly combined with hydrogen. This finding supports previous observations of telescopic comets and provides new insights into the composition of comets.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comet Analysis"}
