The author focuses on the resistance experienced by bodies that form a wake, such as airplanes, and provides a theoretical and experimental analysis of air resistance. The study includes the effects of velocity, shape, and pressure on air resistance, and suggests that the resistance can be separated into different components, including surface friction and the formation of eddies in the wake.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
