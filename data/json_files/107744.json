They conduct an experiment on a deer's horn, cutting the nerves supplying the velvet, and observe the temperature changes. The author also investigates the role of the placenta in heat production and discusses the temperature of the uterus during pregnancy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
