The author finds that suction has a stabilizing effect on the flow, while blowing is destabilizing. The study also shows that suction increases the critical Reynolds number associated with stationary modes of disturbance and the number of spiral vortices that precede turbulent flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
