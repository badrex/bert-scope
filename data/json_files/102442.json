The symptoms were similar across all affected individuals, and the disease seemed to spread universally, affecting people of all ages, genders, and social classes. The epidemic lasted for about four to five weeks, and although it affected a large number of people, very few died from it. Dr. Molineux also compared this epidemic to a similar fever that occurred in 1688, noting the similarities in their spread and impact.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Epidemiology"}
