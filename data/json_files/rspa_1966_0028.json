The authors analyze the charge exchange forward scattering amplitude using the optical theorem and dispersion relation, and present predictions for the exchange forward cross section. They also examine the Regge pole model and its implications for the angular distribution of the charge exchange process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
