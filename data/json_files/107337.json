This explosive gas was different from the gas produced by other methods and had unique properties. The gas could be dangerous to work with and was analyzed to determine its composition. This discovery helped explain the contradictory accounts of oxymuriatic gas properties and provided insight into the nature of chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
