They derived the ultraviolet surface brightness for four wavelength bands and compared the flux distributions in each cloud with a galactic luminosity function. The results showed that the Small Magellanic Cloud had a lower ultraviolet surface brightness than the Large Magellanic Cloud, likely due to a smaller space density of early-type stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Galaxy Evolution"}
