The crystals have a unique elongated square prism shape with triangular end faces. The researchers found that crystal growth is not simple equilibrium growth, and preferential growth along the crystallographic a-axis leads to crystal elongation. The study provides insights into the factors that control crystal morphology in biological species and the possible functions of these crystals in radiolarian development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Radiolaria and Biomineralization"}
