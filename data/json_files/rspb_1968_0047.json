They found that reducing sodium concentration delayed the increase in end-plate potential amplitude and miniature end-plate potential frequency, while increasing potassium concentration reduced the time to conduction blockade. The results suggest that intracellular sodium accumulation and loss of potassium play a significant role in the behavior of motor nerve endings treated with digoxin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
