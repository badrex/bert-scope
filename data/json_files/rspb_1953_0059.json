They found that adenosine triphosphate, coenzyme I, glutathione, cobalt, and a new unidentified factor are essential for maintaining the integrity of brain mitochondria. The authors also discovered a complex interrelationship between these cofactors and metals, and that copper can antagonize the action of cobalt.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
