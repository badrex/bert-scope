The study assumes that the three independent elastic parameters are unknown continuous functions of depth and shows that solutions for these functions can be obtained in the form of Taylor's series. The analysis uses displacement equations in a spherical coordinate system and separates the equations to find solutions for different types of motions. The method provides a way to determine the separate variation of density and elastic parameters in the earth's interior using surface displacement observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
