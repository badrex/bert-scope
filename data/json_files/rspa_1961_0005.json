They discuss the extrusion, compression, and expansion effects of these plasmas, as well as their associated shock patterns and conductivity-density relationships. The study reveals that detonation-generated plasmas are characteristic of detonation in all condensed high explosives and have a metallic-like character.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma physics"}
