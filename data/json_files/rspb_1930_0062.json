They found that no two chicks' corpuscles are exactly alike, and even closely related individuals have distinct differences. The author also explored the process of immunizing chicks with the blood of their siblings and the formation of antibodies, suggesting that red blood corpuscles are \"multiple antigens\" with independent antigenic units that maintain their independence during hereditary transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
