The authors summarize various theories and observations related to solar rotation, differential rotation, and the concentration of magnetic fields in the photosphere and chromosphere. They also explore the emergence of magnetic flux and the transition region between the chromosphere and the corona.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
