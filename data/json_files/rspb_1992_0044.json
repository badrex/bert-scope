This type of inheritance protects host populations from detrimental symbionts while allowing beneficial ones to spread. The authors propose a population-genetic model that demonstrates how uniparental inheritance can evolve due to the presence of nuclear genes that modify the cytoplasmic genetic system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
