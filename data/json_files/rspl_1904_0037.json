The authors discuss the theory of construction, determination of mechanical constants, and the method for calculating the resistance. They also compare the results with other units of resistance and international ohms, highlighting the importance of accurate measurements in metrology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrical and Optical Metrology"}
