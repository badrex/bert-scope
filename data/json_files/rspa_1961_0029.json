They measured the circulation around a fine wire by observing the rate of precession of the wire's transverse vibration plane. The results confirmed the quantization of superfluid circulation in units of the reduced Planck constant, and showed that superfluid circulations, including free vortex lines, can persist indefinitely even when the rotation of the apparatus is stopped.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
