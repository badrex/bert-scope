They apply this method to a lifting surface of circular planform immersed in a uniform stream, considering a plane wing or straight chord lines that may be twisted. The study provides an infinite set of solutions that satisfy null boundary conditions and helps determine lift and moment coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics and Aerodynamics"}
