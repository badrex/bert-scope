He suggests that the property of double refraction is not inherent in the molecules themselves but results from their compression due to extraneous forces or inherent attraction of aggregation. The author also discusses the effects of heat and pressure on fluids and crystals, and how these forces influence their optical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
