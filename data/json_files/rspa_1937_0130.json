They identified important quartet and doublet terms and provided a thorough analysis of the spectrum, which was challenging due to the overlapping multiplets and unique electronic configuration of bromine. This study contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the properties of heavy elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
