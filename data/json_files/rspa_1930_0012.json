They found that the NO overtone consists of branches and is of the same general character as the fundamental. The molecular constants were evaluated, and the ratio of the intensities of the overtone and fundamental was compared with theoretical values.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
