They found that certain concentrations of antiseptics, like carbolic acid, can destroy the bactericidal power of human leucocytes while having little to no inhibitory action on the growth of staphylococci. This study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of antiseptics on both bacteria and the body's immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
