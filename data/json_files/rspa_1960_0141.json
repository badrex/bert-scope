They used a flow system and gas-liquid chromatographic techniques to analyze the products and found that the formation of carbonium ions, rather than being the rate-determining step, might depend on the rate of decomposition of larger carbonium ions. This research provides insights into the initiation of cracking processes and the role of carbonium ions in catalytic reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
