They found that these waves are more frequent and intense during nighttime hours. The authors also investigated the phenomenon of a lull in electric wave activity at sunrise and sunset, which they attributed to changes in the propagation of electric waves through the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
