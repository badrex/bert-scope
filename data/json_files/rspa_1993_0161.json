They use a generalized Taylor polycrystal model to analyze the material's response to different loading histories and initial conditions, finding that localization occurs from the growth of an initial inhomogeneity. The study focuses on plane strain tension, biaxial tension, and simple shear, and explores the effects of material properties, initial conditions, and imperfection amplitude on the localization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Plasticity"}
