They explore the dependence of the radiated field and its Pointing vector on direction and frequency, and discuss three types of signal enhancement: enhancement for directions close to the magnetic field direction, resonance cones, and Storey cones. The paper also covers the effects of crossover frequencies in plasmas with multiple positive ion species.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
