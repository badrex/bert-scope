Using precise instruments and careful observations, Lloyd found that the high-water mark in the Pacific was 3.55 feet higher than the high-water mark in the Atlantic. This study provided valuable information about the differences in ocean levels and tides on either side of the Isthmus.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
