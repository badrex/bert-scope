They discovered that light chains have three disulphide bridges and found similarities in the structure of normal and myeloma light chains. The authors also discussed the implications of their findings on understanding the immune response and the potential role of genetic mutations in the variability of light chains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
