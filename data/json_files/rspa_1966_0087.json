The authors found that fluctuations in detonation velocities increase with fuel concentration, but once carbon formation is established, detonation stability is enhanced. A possible mechanism based on a main reaction is proposed to explain these findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
