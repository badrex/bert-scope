They conducted a rotational analysis of some bands and found that they correspond to transitions to the upper level of the Lyman-Birge-Hopfield System. The study provides new information about the electronic states and molecular constants of nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
