They concluded that the elastic system of muscle consists of flexible, primary-valence chain molecules that become ordered when stretched and return to a random arrangement with thermal agitation. The elastic force increases more rapidly at intermediate elongations, and latent heat is set free during stretching. X-ray studies support the molecular interpretation of the muscle's viscous-elastic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Biology"}
