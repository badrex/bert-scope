They found that the efficiency of interaction does not vary much with the nature of alkyl substituents in the molecule. The results are discussed in relation to information available on the reaction of radicals with olefines and alkyl radicals with olefines, demonstrating complete general agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
