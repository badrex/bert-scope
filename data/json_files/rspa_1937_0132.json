They use crystals that sublime at ordinary temperatures, such as iodine, to study the effect of molecular dipole moments on the condensation process. The experiments reveal that polar crystals have smaller condensation coefficients, indicating that molecular orientation in the solid state may influence these values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Science"}
