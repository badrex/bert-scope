They found that these salts have smaller anisotropy and their temperature variation deviates more from the Curie law compared to similar salts. The authors also discovered that the crystalline and ionic magnetic axes change direction with temperature, and the anisotropic field coefficients related to orbital and spin splittings of energy levels vary significantly from salt to salt and with temperature. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties of these hydrated salts and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
