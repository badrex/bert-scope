The authors focused on overcoming various sources of error and improving the accuracy of measurements. The final measurements range from 10 to 225\u00b0C and are considered to be within 1 part in 1500 of the true values. The research contributes to the understanding of steam properties and the development of steam tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
