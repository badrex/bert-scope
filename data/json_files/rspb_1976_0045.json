They analyzed these relaxation times to obtain values for the diffusion coefficients for motion about individual carbon-carbon bonds and motion about the long axis of the hydrocarbon chains in the bilayer. The results indicate that motion about carbon-carbon bonds in phospholipid bilayers is relatively rapid, emphasizing the fluid nature of the hydrocarbon chain region of such bilayers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Lipid Chemistry"}
