They discuss the role of fermentation in breaking down stored proteids and the transformation of these materials into new forms that can travel to growing parts of the plant. The author also explores the different types of proteids found in seeds and their role in plant metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
