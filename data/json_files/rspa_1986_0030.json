These partons have electromagnetic and weak properties similar to quarks, and their existence has been confirmed through deep inelastic scattering experiments. The article also explores the weak neutral currents and parity-violating interference observed in neutrino scattering, which provide evidence for the connection between partons and quarks. The structure functions and weak interactions of quarks and leptons are analyzed, revealing the proton's internal structure and the nature of elementary particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
