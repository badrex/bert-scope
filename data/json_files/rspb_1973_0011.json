The eye has a clear zone between the cornea and crystalline cone, which is composed of layers with varying refractive indices. The researchers found that parallel rays entering a facet converge to a focal region, and the receptor acceptance angle can be adjusted based on the position of the distal pigment. The study concludes that the eye has poor acuity but high sensitivity due to summation across the clear zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
