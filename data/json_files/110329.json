The theorems cover divisibility of terms when raised to certain powers, and the divisibility of sums of terms under specific conditions. These findings contribute to the understanding of mathematical properties and theorems in the field of abstract algebra.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Abstract Algebra"}
