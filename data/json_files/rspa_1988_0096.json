The authors calculate the characteristic responses of overlapping cracks for the alternating-current field-measurement method and compare them with experimental data. The results show that overlapping cracks produce asymmetric cross-crack signal profiles and characteristic changes in curvature, which can be used to find the positions of the crack ends.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
