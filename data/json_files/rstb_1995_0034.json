The results show a low surface area in the coelacanth, indicating a relatively inactive lifestyle with a low consumption rate and food requirement. The study also examines the gill morphology and provides insights into the adaptation of the coelacanth to its environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Anatomy and Physiology"}
