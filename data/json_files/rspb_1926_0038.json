They discovered that the endodermis has different stages of development, each with distinct micro-chemical properties. The endodermis acts as a barrier, preventing the exchange of water and water-soluble solutes between the tissues it separates. The study confirms the presence of fatty substances and complexes in the endodermis, which play a role in its function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
