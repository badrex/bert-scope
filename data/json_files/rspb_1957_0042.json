The insects show various defense reactions, such as haemocytic envelopes and melanin deposition, which can lead to the death of the parasite. The study finds that these reactions are distinguishable but do not show significant differences between exopterygote and endopterygote insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
