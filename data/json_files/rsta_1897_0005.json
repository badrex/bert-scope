They developed a method to simultaneously release a metal timing-sphere and a liquid drop, which created a splash at the moment the timing-sphere passed between two charged Leyden jars. The photographs captured detailed information about the splash, providing a better understanding of the phenomena and improving upon previous drawings and observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
