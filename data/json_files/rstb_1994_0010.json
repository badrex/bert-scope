They present a study on the rocky intertidal zone, showing how recruitment levels determine the processes taking place within the ecosystem. The study also highlights the influence of offshore fronts on the population dynamics of barnacles in California.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine and Coastal Ecology"}
