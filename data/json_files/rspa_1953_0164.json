The authors develop a method that accounts for the instability of excited states and provides a modified propagator to calculate the energy-level shifts and decay coefficients. The method can be extended to higher approximations and offers a relativistic explanation for the Lamb shift and decay coefficients in hydrogen atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
