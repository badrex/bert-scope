The research focuses on the role of DNA and protein within DNP and the type of bonds present. The findings suggest that protein does not link DNA molecules lengthways, and the DNP structure may involve loops. The study also shows that proteolytic enzymes and DNAase affect the DNP structure, while RNAase has minimal impact.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
