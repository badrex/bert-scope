They discovered that different nerve roots control various muscle movements and that muscles supplied by one nerve root can have opposing actions. The authors also found that when a nerve root is divided, it causes temporary paresis of the muscles it supplies, and that there is no overflow of impulses to other nerve roots. These findings provide insight into the complex relationships between nerve roots, muscles, and spinal levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy and Physiology"}
