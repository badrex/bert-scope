They used this technique to study potassium chloride, grey tin, and graphite, finding that their specific heats followed a T^3 relation at temperatures below about 60 K. The heat switch provided better thermal insulation and eliminated the need for exchange gases, improving the accuracy of the measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
