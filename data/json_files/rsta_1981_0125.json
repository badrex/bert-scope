They use the spatial distribution of radio pulsars and the available data on identified gamma-ray pulsars to derive the number and distribution of visible gamma-ray pulsars from Earth. The results suggest that a significant fraction of unidentified gamma-ray sources may be pulsars, providing insights into the nature of these celestial objects and their role in gamma-ray emission.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
