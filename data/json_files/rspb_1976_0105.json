Active immunization in marmosets suppresses fertility for about a year, while passive immunization has short-lived effects. The authors suggest that further research is needed to develop synthetic polypeptide fractions and conjugation of purified fractions to non-toxic adjuvants for human immunization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
