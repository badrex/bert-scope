The researchers found that the upper explosion limit is raised when deuterium replaces hydrogen, making the mixture more explosive. The difference in the reaction can be attributed to the difference in molecular speeds between the two isotopes. The study also shows that deuterium reacts less rapidly than hydrogen, with the initial rate being about 60% of that with hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Isotope chemistry"}
