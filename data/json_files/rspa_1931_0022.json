The authors found that the detonation range of these mixtures lies between 40% and 80% carbon monoxide content, while the inflammation range is between 16.4% and 94% carbon monoxide content. The experimental results provide insights into the behavior of these mixtures and their potential applications in combustion research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
