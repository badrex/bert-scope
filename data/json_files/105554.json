The lightning caused significant damage to the church's steeple and spire. Delaval observed that the metal parts of the structure conducted the lightning, causing explosions and breaking stones. He proposed that a large metallic conductor extending from the top of the spire to the ground could prevent such damage in similar buildings.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Building Construction and Lightning Protection"}
