They found that the rate of action of these drugs increased with temperature, and the temperature coefficient of increase ranged from 2.04 for chloroform to 2.52 for quinine. The results showed that the pharmacodynamic action of drugs follows the laws of chemical action in relation to temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Pharmacology"}
