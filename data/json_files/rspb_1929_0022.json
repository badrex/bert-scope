The results show that a small concentration of peptone enhances the stabilizing effect of plasma on platelets and prevents blood clotting. The anticoagulant action of peptone is mainly due to its restraint on changes in the plasma, which helps in inhibiting blood clotting by temporarily preventing platelet disintegration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
