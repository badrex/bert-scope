They also discovered that the sensitivity to slow stimulus motion helps distinguish retinal ganglion cells that receive a light-driven cholinergic input from those that do not. This suggests that the dense plexus of cholinergic dendrites and the transient nature of acetylcholine release contribute to the detection of motion within smaller regions than ganglion cells' receptive fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
