They found that the best interpretation of the vibrational spectrum supports a symmetrical structure for the ion, with a single minimum in the potential energy function. The study also provides insights into the molecular environment and selection rules in the crystal state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid State Chemistry"}
