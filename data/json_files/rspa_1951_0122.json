They find that in the presence of a magnetic field, the antiferromagnetic is effectively identical to the ferromagnetic. The authors also discuss the behavior of an antiferromagnetic at absolute zero and the entropy's relationship with magnetic field and temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
