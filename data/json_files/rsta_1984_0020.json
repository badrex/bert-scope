The authors focus on the creation of horseshoes, a type of chaotic behavior, and explore the relation between bifurcation sets and invariant sets of one- and two-dimensional maps. They use the orientation-preserving H\u00e9non map as their main example and discuss the differences in bifurcation sequences between one- and two-dimensional maps.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
