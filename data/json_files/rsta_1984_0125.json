They use a semiclassical exciton-biexciton model to obtain the stationary solutions for optical bistability by numerical integration of the second-order Maxwell equation. The results show that the nonlinearity causing optical bistability is nearly of the Kerr medium type, and the two-photon biexciton resonance contributes weakly to the bistability characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
