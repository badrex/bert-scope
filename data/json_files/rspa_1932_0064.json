They discovered that the spectrum closely resembles that of nitric oxide (NO). The study provides a preliminary vibrational analysis of the NS bands and suggests that the NS bands are attributed to transitions between specific molecular levels. The findings contribute to the understanding of molecular spectroscopy and the properties of nitrogen compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
