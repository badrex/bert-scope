It presents evidence of a significant reduction in ribosome content during meiotic prophase, followed by its restoration through the disintegration of nucleoloids. The study also highlights the role of organelle and membrane cycles during meiosis, which are essential for the transition from the sporophytic to the gametophytic phase of the plant life cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
