The focus is on the Curie temperature and saturation magnetization at, considering the effects of anisotropic exchange interaction on aligning the moment. The author discusses the case where exchange interaction and crystal field effects are comparable in magnitude, leading to a complex problem that requires a perturbation approach.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
