This method considers the time elapsed between the last payment and the moment of the life's expiration, providing a more accurate calculation for annuities. The new method also accounts for the possibility of different intervals of life having uniform decrements, improving the connection between various life stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Actuarial Science"}
