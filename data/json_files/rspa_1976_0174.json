They consider a harmonically bound, plane rigid rotator in the form of a flat disk carrying a permanent electric dipole, subjected to random torques from Brownian motion. The study uses the Langevin equation and linear response theory to calculate the electric polarizability and its variation with frequency, taking into account inertial effects. The results are used to represent the frequency dependence of the polarizability of a polar molecule with a permanent dipole moment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
