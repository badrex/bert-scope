The author investigates various types of penicillins, including mono- and di-substituted methylpenicillins, a-substituted benzylpenicillins, and trisubstituted methylpenicillins. The article highlights the importance of side-chain structure in determining the effectiveness of these antibiotics against different types of bacteria and their resistance to enzymes like penicillinases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Medicinal Chemistry"}
