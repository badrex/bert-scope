The authors describe their experience with a formally verified version of a floating-point package, which was used in the design of the T800 microprocessor. They also introduce the Occam transformation system, which helps in transforming and verifying programs, ensuring their correctness and efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Computer Science"}
