The observations were made using various magnetic needles, and the data collected was used to determine the horizontal intensity of the Earth's magnetic field at different locations. The findings of this study contributed to the understanding of terrestrial magnetism and its applications in navigation and surveying.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
