The mollusk assemblages indicate the presence of a large, well-oxygenated river, the proto-Thames, surrounded by marsh and flowing through a fully wooded, temperate interglacial landscape. The mollusk fauna's composition reflects local changes associated with the river shifting its course. The deposits are assigned to Zone CrIIIb of the Cromerian interglacial, and declines in the abundance of specimens and species numbers may have a climatic cause.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
