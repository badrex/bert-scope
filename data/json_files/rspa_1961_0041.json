They compared various ionosphere models and found that one model, which closely agrees with experimental observations, should be modified to better represent the day-time ionosphere in summer. The study also discusses the transition from day to night conditions in the ionosphere and the effect of sudden ionospheric disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
