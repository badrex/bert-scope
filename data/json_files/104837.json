He noticed that eels would first extend their heads and part of their bodies out of the water, possibly to thicken a slimy substance on their bodies, before sliding up the surfaces with ease. This behavior supports earlier accounts of eels moving across meadows at night.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
