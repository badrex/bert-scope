The oxidation rate is independent of oxygen pressure and proportional to the square of the hydrocarbon concentration. The reaction is a simple chain process without interaction of chain centers, and the energy-chain mechanism is responsible for the observed kinetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
