They found that while most cultures showed transformed properties, only a few survived the crisis period and became permanent lines. This study highlights the rarity of transformation by SV40 in human skin fibroblasts, even in cells from patients predisposed to cancer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
