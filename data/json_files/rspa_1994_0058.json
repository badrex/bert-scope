The author explains the need for the 'dual' affine Weyl group and the use of monodromic systems in non-simply laced cases. The paper contributes to the program of expressing the characters of irreducible modular representations of semisimple groups in terms of combinatorics of affine Hecke algebras.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Combinatorics"}
