They found that when a mask was used, the length of time for which cells fired in response to the test stimulus decreased. This suggests that the mask stimulated adjacent cells in the cortex, reducing the responses of cells activated by the test stimulus. The results provide evidence that a cortical area can perform computations necessary for visual recognition in 20-30 ms, setting a fundamental constraint for theories of cortical computation.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Cognitive Neuroscience"}
