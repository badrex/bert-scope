Their observations confirmed the presence of various defect structures predicted by molecular dynamics simulations, providing a direct confirmation of the theoretical predictions. The tunnelling spectra showed a reduced gap between the highest occupied molecular orbitals and the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals for clusters with defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
