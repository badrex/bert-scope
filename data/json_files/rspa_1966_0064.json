They found that the permeability coefficients remained independent of pressure and amount sorbed, and that the surface flow occurred by a random walk diffusion mechanism (surface hopping) rather than a viscous flow mechanism. This research provides insights into the transport mechanisms of adsorbed gases in microporous media and the potential for interconversion of surface to gas-phase flux.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Surface Chemistry"}
