This battery is ideal for telegraphy, as it can be left for weeks or months without attention and renews its strength after each period of rest. The zinc oxide produced falls to the bottom of the vessel and can be separated when needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Battery Technology"}
