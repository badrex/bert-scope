Asymmetry in the functional parts of the tail is more costly than ornaments like tail streamers. The cost of wing asymmetry and functional tail asymmetry remains constant or decreases with trait length. This research helps explain the variation in fluctuating asymmetry in wings and tails due to natural selection for aerodynamic efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
