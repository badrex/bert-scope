The authors review the theoretical description of inelastic scattering events and present recent calculations aimed at understanding the excitation of surface phonons in electron scattering experiments. The study explores the energy variation of the cross section for the excitation of surface phonons and provides a reliable theoretical framework for interpreting inelastic electron scattering data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
