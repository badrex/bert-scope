They used various methods to measure the resistance of the films and observed the colors produced when light passed through them. The authors found that the thickness of the black portion of the film varied, and they provided a formula to calculate the resistance of the black portion. The results showed that the thickness of soap films can be measured and studied, providing insights into surface tension and film properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Tension"}
