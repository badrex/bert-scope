They derive a general formula relating the force needed for large extension to the torsional modulus for small torsion. The study includes incompressible materials and provides solutions for various types of cylinders, such as cardioids, epitrochoids, and Booth's lemniscates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
