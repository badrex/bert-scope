The method relies on concentration gradients of permeant molecules producing lower rates of osmotic flow than impermeant molecules. This technique allows for measuring permeability in a short time frame and can be applied to non-electrolytes that undergo chemical transformation in aqueous solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Physiology"}
