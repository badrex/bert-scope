They found that certain modifications, such as N-terminal acylation and changes to the tryptophan and methionine residues, could affect the compounds' acid-stimulatory properties. The most active synthetic compound, pentagastrin, showed potential as a diagnostic agent for assessing gastric secretory function."}
