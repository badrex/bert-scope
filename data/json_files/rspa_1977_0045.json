They investigate the dynamical properties of a flame advancing down a tube and calculate the relative values of the intensities and frequencies of possible acoustic modes. The results show general agreement with observations and provide a method for experimental determination of the rate of growth of the amplitudes of the permissible modes of vibration.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric and Combustion Science"}
