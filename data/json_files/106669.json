The instrument consists of two fixed plates, a revolving plate, and a ball. By rotating the plate, the instrument can generate and manipulate electricity, leading to increased intensities and even sparking. This discovery has implications for the study of electricity and could be useful in multiplying and manipulating electricities in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
