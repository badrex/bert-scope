They found that the rotation of a copper plate affected a magnetized needle, and that the magnetic influence could be diminished or annulled by interposing certain materials. The authors also discovered that the magnetic properties of different materials varied, with some materials like silver having a higher rank in the scale of magnetic energy, while others like gold had a lower rank.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
