They found that all chloroplasts in expanding cells divide, and the synthesis of chloroplast DNA is correlated with the rate of chloroplast formation. Chloroplast replication and growth were manipulated by varying light intensity and quality, providing insights into the relationship between chloroplast development and DNA synthesis in spinach leaf cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
