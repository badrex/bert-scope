It presents evidence that the terminal glucosyl residues of the dolichyl-PP-oligo-saccharide intermediate are responsible for decreasing the rate of peptide to be glycosylated. The study also introduces a liposomal model system that allows the study of dolichyl phosphate-dependent transmembrane transport of mannosyl residues. The results suggest that mannosylation of Dol-P and the transmembrane translocation of Dol-P-Man are catalyzed by the enzyme simultaneously, with only a small fraction of the enzyme molecules carrying out the coupled reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
