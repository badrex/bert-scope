The authors found that the rate of chloroform elimination and assumption is nearly equal, and the amount of chloroform in the blood depends on the respiratory movements. They also discovered that the nerve centers become paralyzed during anaesthesia, affecting the respiratory system and the rate of chloroform assimilation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
