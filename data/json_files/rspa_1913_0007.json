The study also reveals that processes that make iron chemically active also increase its photoelectric activity, while processes that make it passive decrease the activity. This suggests a correlation between chemical activity and photoelectric activity, and that there are varying degrees of activity and passivity in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
