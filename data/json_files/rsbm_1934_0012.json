He invented the magnetic potentiometer, which is a useful tool for investigating magnetic fields in inaccessible places. Chattock also determined the mobility of both positive and negative ions using the wind pressure method. His work had a profound impact on the understanding of the atomic charge and the role of orbital motion and electron spin in the ground states of various ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
