They discovered that some materials, like silk and thread, behave differently when exposed to electrical effluvia. The experiments also showed that the repulsive force between electrical bodies can be influenced by the type of material and its texture. These findings contribute to the understanding of the electrical phenomenon and the behavior of different materials when exposed to electrical energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
