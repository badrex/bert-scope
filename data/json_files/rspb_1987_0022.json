The authors find that acetylcholine blocks calcium current permeability, which is crucial for modulating moderate chronotropic changes and may also play a role in complete vagal inhibition. The research uses a computer model to simulate the effects of acetylcholine on cardiac electrophysiology and provides insights into the complex interactions between different ion currents in the heart.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
