The solution is derived using the method of conjugate functions and is applicable to cases of high-frequency currents. The study provides insights into the potential, charge distribution, repulsion, and capacitance of the conductors, which can be useful in understanding electrical phenomena and designing electrical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
