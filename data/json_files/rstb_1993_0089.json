The authors provide evidence that ABA, synthesized in roots, moves through the xylem stream to the shoot, providing a measure of the plant's water access in the soil. This signal can influence leaf growth, stomatal conductance, and other aspects of shoot physiology, helping plants adapt to water scarcity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
