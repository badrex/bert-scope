The author investigates the effects of sinkers (structures formed by parasites) on host xylem elements and describes the various ways in which the parasites interact with their hosts, including the control of differentiation in the host wood and the formation of galls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
