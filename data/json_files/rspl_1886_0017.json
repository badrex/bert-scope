They found that magnetization causes iron rods to elongate, while steel and nickel rods to retract. The degree of elongation or retraction depends on the type of steel (blue-tempered or yellow-tempered) and the tension applied to the rods. These findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between magnetization and material properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
