They introduce a set of assumptions and equations to calculate the configurational free energy of a conformal solution, which can be applied to liquids and gases. This theory allows for a better understanding of the thermodynamic properties of mixtures and their interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
