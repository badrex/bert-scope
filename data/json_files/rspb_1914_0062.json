They propose that during contraction, lactic acid forms in the muscle fibers, causing them to swell and change shape. This process is compared to an osmometer, where increased pressure leads to muscle contraction. The author also discusses the rate of contraction and the role of lactic acid diffusion in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
