The research found that the rate of respiration in these organs increased with higher oxygen concentrations, but decreased after reaching an optimal level. The findings contribute to understanding how plants respond to different oxygen levels and could have implications for agriculture and food storage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
