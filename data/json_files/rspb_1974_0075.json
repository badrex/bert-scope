They used marking, release, and recapture techniques to track the movement of wild flies in their natural habitat. The results showed that the average distance traveled by the flies was 192 meters after one day and 219 meters after two days, with no significant differences among the four species in their dispersal behavior. This study helps to distinguish active dispersal from passive transport and provides insights into the factors that influence the mobility of insect species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
