They developed techniques to separate the Earth's response to meteorological and oceanic loading from loading associated with earthquakes and tectonic processes. The study suggests that monitoring variations in fault strength along the San Andreas fault may help predict earthquakes and improve understanding of the Earth's tectonic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
