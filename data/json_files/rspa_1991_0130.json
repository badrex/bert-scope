They find the approximate stress field surrounding the plastic zone and discuss the dislocation density and stress fields of dislocation pairs. The study helps in understanding the behavior of cracks in elastic-plastic materials and their stress fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
