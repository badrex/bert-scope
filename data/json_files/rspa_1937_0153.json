They determined the density of unoccupied energy levels in the metals and observed the variations of the absorption coefficient for radiation between 100 and 300 A. This research provided insights into the understanding of the complex region where the first two Brillouin zones overlap.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
