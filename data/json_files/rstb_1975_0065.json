They explore the hierarchy of concepts and working hypotheses used in biology and the importance of molecular shape and specific forces in determining chemical behavior. The authors also mention the need for improving the rigor of interrelations between different levels of biological systems and eliminating ill-founded concepts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
