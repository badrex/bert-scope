They found a laminin-like molecule, a six-armed molecule resembling tenascin, and a rod-like molecule resembling collagen type IV. These molecules are structurally related to proteins that have been implicated in neuronal growth and development in the vertebrate nervous system. The discovery represents a first step in determining the role of these molecules in neurite outgrowth during development and regeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
