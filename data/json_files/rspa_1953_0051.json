This resistance is not due to mutants or stably adapted cells, but rather temporary adjustments that occur during the test. The proportion of longer-lived cells increases when glucose and oxygen are present in the medium, supporting active metabolic changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
