It demonstrates that for a power law streaming speed, the velocity profile that develops downstream is asymptotically unique and similar to the Falkner-Skan similarity solution. The study also provides a theoretical justification for the role of similar solutions in boundary layer theory and proves the existence of concave velocity profiles when the pressure gradient is favorable.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics"}
