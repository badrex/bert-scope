The author, John Walker, examines the composition of the water, which contains a large proportion of iron and an aluminous salt. He also investigates the medicinal properties of the water and its potential benefits, noting its strong astringent and sweet, subacid taste. The author concludes that the water of this spring contains a higher proportion of iron than most other chalybeat waters, making it a valuable resource for medicinal purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
