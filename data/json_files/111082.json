The author, Edward Sabine, presents the results of observations at Toronto and Hobarton, showing that the magnetic needle approaches the vertical position more in the winter months and that the total force is greatest during these months. The author calls for further research and observations to confirm these findings and understand the underlying causes of the annual variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
