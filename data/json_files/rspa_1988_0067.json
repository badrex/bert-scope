The method uses a hodograph transformation and an orthogonal mesh aligned parallel to equipotentials, resulting in automatic mesh refinement where the electric field is greatest. This approach reduces problems to a rectangular region in space and allows flexibility in choosing boundary conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
