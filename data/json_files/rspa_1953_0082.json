The author analyzes data from three observatories and develops a theory that suggests ionospheric perturbations are caused by an electrostatic field spreading over the Earth from the auroral zones. This field influences the ionization in the ionosphere, leading to changes in height and density of the ionospheric regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
