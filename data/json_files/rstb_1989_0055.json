The authors use numerical simulations with two different mesoscale atmospheric models to analyze the surface energy budget and atmospheric response to forest-induced surface flux variations. The results show that forests can significantly affect local meteorological circulations, leading to changes in wind patterns, temperature, and moisture distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Climatology"}
