He also discusses the purging properties of these salts and their potential use in medicine. The salts' shapes remain consistent even when dissolved and re-solidified, and some have multiple shapes. The author also notes that different plant parts can yield different salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Salt Chemistry"}
