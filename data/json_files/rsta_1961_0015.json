They found that the viscosity of the oil at the surface temperature of the disks is the most important factor affecting film thickness, and that film thickness is independent of load at loads greater than 7. The results showed that film thickness is proportional to both rolling speed and viscosity, and that the introduction of sliding has a minimal effect on film thickness.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
