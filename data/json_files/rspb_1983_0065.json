They found that walking is initiated by many neurons acting in consensus, rather than a single command neuron. The type of walking output is determined by the \"across-fibre pattern\" of all the inputs to the pattern generators, providing flexibility and adaptability in the behavior. This alternative to the command concept suggests that walking is controlled by a distributed system of neurons working together.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Behavior"}
