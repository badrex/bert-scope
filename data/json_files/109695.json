He explains that during the prevalence of westerly winds, the height of the tides is greater in the southern parts of Great Britain, and a current overcomes the ebb-tide. This can lead to unexpected dangers for ships navigating the area, as demonstrated by the loss of the Britannia East Indiaman.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
