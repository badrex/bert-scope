They found that the gas contains a mixture of carbonic acid and azotic gas, and that the expansion of the gas by electricity does not indicate a decomposition of charcoal. This research contributes to the understanding of the composition and properties of carbon compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas composition"}
