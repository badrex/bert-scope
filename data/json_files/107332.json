They found that the brain is not directly necessary for heart action, and that artificial respiration can keep the heart beating after the brain is removed. The author also questioned the widely held belief that animal heat is dependent on chemical changes in the blood during respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
