Clifford, presents theorems related to the nature of space and the representation of curves in flat spaces of lower dimensions. He discusses the properties of curves of various orders and their applications in geometry. The paper also includes a description of an instrument for calculating integrals of products of given functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
