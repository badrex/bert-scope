The observations were made using different instruments and color filters to capture the red, auroral, and blue regions of the spectrum. The results indicate that the night sky brightness varies at different locations, with the Royal Observatory near Cape Town being slightly brighter due to city lights. The study provides valuable data for understanding the night sky's behavior and potential sources of light pollution.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
