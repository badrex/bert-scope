They extend the framework of interface fracture mechanics to include rapidly applied loads, fast crack propagation, and strain rate-dependent material response. The study simplifies the problem by considering an instantaneous steady-state, two-dimensional singularity, and provides solutions for dynamic stress intensity factors in various configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
