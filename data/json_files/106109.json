L. F. Crell, conducted experiments to study the presence and role of volatile alcali in putrefaction. They discovered that volatile alcali is present during specific stages of putrefaction and is essential for the process. The author also discussed the limitations of using alcalies as antiseptics in living bodies due to their stimulating qualities and potential to increase morbific matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
