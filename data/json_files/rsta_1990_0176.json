The authors investigate the location of water compartments and the anatomical changes that occur during germination. They find that water uptake is a triphasic process involving rapid rehydration, steady uptake during active metabolism, and a final rapid uptake during root system development. NMR microscopy offers a unique window into the water uptake process and can help understand the role of water in germination and growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
