They discovered that antelopes can act as reservoirs for the trypanosome, which causes a rapidly fatal disease in cattle and domestic animals. The author found that laboratory-bred flies were not efficient carriers of the trypanosome, but antelopes could harbor the parasite for at least 323 days without showing any harm to the host.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
