It examines the relationships between electrophysiological characteristics and morphological cell types of these neurons through intracellular recordings and dye injection in anaesthetized rats. The study also explores the possibility of dichotomizing peripheral afferent fibers as a basis for referred pain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
