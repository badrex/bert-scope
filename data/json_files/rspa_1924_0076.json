R. Merton, discusses advancements in ultra-violet spectro-photometry techniques, specifically the use of platinum wedges to measure the density gradient in the ultra-violet spectrum. The platinum wedges provide a more accurate and continuous measurement of the intensity of light, allowing for better comparison of rays with different wavelengths. This method improves the accuracy of ultra-violet spectro-photometry and expands its range of applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
