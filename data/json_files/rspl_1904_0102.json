They compare the stability and behavior of these compounds in the presence of acids and enzymes, providing insights into their intrinsic properties and the activities of various compounds amenable to hydrolysis. The study highlights the differences in the action of acids and enzymes on different sugars and emphasizes the importance of understanding enzyme activity for future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
