They discussed the separation of atomic and molecular absorption and presented the data as absolute cross-section curves as a function of wavelength. The shapes of the atomic photoionization continua and their absolute values were analyzed in relation to existing theoretical cross-section data. The results provide insights into the photoionization processes in alkali metal vapours, which are significant in various plasma and astrophysical problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
