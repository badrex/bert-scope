They report that different genetic variants of the prion protein gene correspond to distinct clinical and pathological features of prion diseases. The distribution of deposits in the central nervous system influences the clinical and pathological aspects of prion diseases, suggesting that accumulations may play a central role in their pathogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
