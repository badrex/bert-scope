They develop a method to solve the full global diffusion equation, including electrodynamic drift, and apply it to a simple model atmosphere. The results confirm electrodynamic lifting as a significant factor controlling the dip equatorial layer and the associated ionization trough.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
