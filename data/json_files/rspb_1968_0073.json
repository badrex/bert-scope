They found that synapses in the visual system of rats change in size and density depending on the lighting conditions, with dark-exposed rats having larger but less densely packed axon terminals. These changes are reversible and may be associated with hormonal changes induced by light or darkness. The author also discusses the possibility of plastic behavior in the retina and the potential for larger changes in the cerebral cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
