They compared their magnetostriction curves with experimental measurements and found good agreement. The study provides a more accurate comparison with experiment by calculating the variation of magnetostriction with applied field for directions other than the principal crystallographic axes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
