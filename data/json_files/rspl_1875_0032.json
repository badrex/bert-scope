They discovered that the poison-fangs in viperine snakes develop in two parallel series, while in colubrine snakes, they develop in a single series. The authors also examined the individual tooth-germ formation and the unique features of the poison-fang, such as the stellate reticulum and the fluted base.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
