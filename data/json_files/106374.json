The phenomenon was described as being on an eminence overlooking low meadow ground. The author discusses the possible causes and theories behind this appearance, including the influence of the observer's shadow and the form, size, and properties of the mist's particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Optics"}
