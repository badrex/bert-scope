The clone was not C6 cDNA but a mimotope, including an epitope that is conformational in C6 and not represented as a continuous sequence in the C6 molecule. This finding confirms that screening expression libraries with antibodies can be an alternative to the synthetic peptide approach to obtain mimotopes reacting with particular antibodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
