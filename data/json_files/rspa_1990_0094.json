The authors derive the Orr-Sommerfeld equation to study the flow instability and find that the nature of the instability can be described as disturbances moving in the instability diagram of equivalent wavenumber against Reynolds number. The results show that the transition from amplification to damping occurs more quickly when the plates are pulled apart compared to when they are squeezed together.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
