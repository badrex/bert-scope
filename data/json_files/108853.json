They demonstrate that these decompositions follow the normal law of chemical action and are not subject to any special hypothesis. The author also examines the catalytic decomposition of peroxides and the role of oxidation and reduction in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
