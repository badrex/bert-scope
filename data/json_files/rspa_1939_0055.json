They argue that the presence of small cracks and structural inhomogeneities in metals cause stress concentrations, which, when combined with plastic deformation, can lead to fatigue failure. The authors also discuss the concept of safe and unsafe ranges of stress and the role of plastic strain in determining the endurance of materials under cyclic loading.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fatigue of Materials"}
