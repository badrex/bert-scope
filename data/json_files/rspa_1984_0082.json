They show that eddies do not attach to the walls and that there is always a flow with a singular cusped streamline before the formation of eddies. This flow is an example of an internal wave of limiting form, which is similar to the Stokes wave of extreme form in the free surface problem. The authors provide examples of limiting waves of depression and elevation in the primary density stratification.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics > Fluid Dynamics"}
