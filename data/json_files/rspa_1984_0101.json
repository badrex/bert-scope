The study suggests that large correlation scales in the potential flow are consistent with a fully three-dimensional turbulence structure, and the results are compared to experimental measurements in a high Reynolds number single-stream turbulent mixing layer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
