It explores his ideas on turbulence, the transition from laminar to turbulent flows, and the predictability of turbulent chaos. The article also highlights the challenges in distinguishing between quasi-periodic systems and genuinely chaotic systems, and the unsolved problems related to the study of turbulence and stochastic processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
