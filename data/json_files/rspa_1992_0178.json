They show that there is only a finite number of indecomposable representations in up to isomorphism for certain cases, while for others, there exist infinitely many orbits. The study provides insights into the structure of indecomposable representations in these graphs.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
