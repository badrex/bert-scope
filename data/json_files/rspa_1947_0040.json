They observed that the selection rule dm = 0, +1 is now extended, and transitions occur for which | | = 2. The findings provide insights into the behavior of levels and intensities in the helium spectrum under the influence of electric and magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
