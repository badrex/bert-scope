The researchers developed a model to test the idea that these neurons perform a coincidence detection or cross-correlation on their inputs from auditory nerve (AN) fibers. The model shows that a coincidence mechanism acting on a group of inputs with different characteristic frequencies can produce the observed sensitivity in the AVCN. This mechanism may help the auditory system process temporal information in complex sounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Auditory System"}
