Lang made significant contributions to the understanding of ferns, plant physiology, and the alternation of generations in plants. His ontogenetic theory, which focused on the environmental conditions affecting plant generations, challenged the prevailing antithetic viewpoint of his time. Lang's work laid the foundation for further research in plant morphology and evolution."}
