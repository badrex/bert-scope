They found that both the exchange effect suggested by Mott and the effect of relativity reduce the scattering much below that predicted classically. The results showed good agreement with Moller's formula, indicating that the scattering of fast beta-particles by electrons is influenced by both relativistic and quantum effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
