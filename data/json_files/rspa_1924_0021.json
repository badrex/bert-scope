The author discusses the fourfold value of the hydrogen constant and the series' characteristics. The study also compares the empirical formulae of Rydberg, Ritz, and Hicks with Bohr's numbers and provides a four-constant formula for the first diffuse series. The article highlights the importance of more accurate measurements in the ordinary region of the spectrum for better understanding of the spectral terms and limits.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
