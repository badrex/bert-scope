They explain how all electrons in a metal are free, and how the difference between good and bad conductors is due to the effect of impurities and temperature. The author also presents a model of a lattice to show how insulators and semi-conductors can be explained using quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
