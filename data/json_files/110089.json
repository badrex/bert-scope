It can move in both forward and backward directions and has a color that matches its environment. The mole-cricket's digestive system resembles that of a bird, with a large crop and a muscular gizzard lined with teeth. The insect's respiratory system is also complex, with ten stigmata on each side of the body. The author suggests that tracheae, which penetrate the entire body, may be responsible for blood circulation in insects. The mole-cricket's sexual organs and the production of sound by its wings are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
