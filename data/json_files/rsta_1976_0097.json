The authors describe the evolution of Fairy Dell, an active landslide complex on the Dorset coast, using cartographic, air photograph, and field survey techniques. They identify two dominant mechanisms: rotational landsliding and block disruption, and propose an evolutionary model for the complex. The study's findings can help in understanding similar areas and aid in planning efficient site investigations for construction projects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
