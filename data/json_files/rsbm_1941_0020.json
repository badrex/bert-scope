He studied at King's College London and the Royal College of Science before spending two years in Germany, where he conducted research under Victor Meyer. Thorpe later worked at Owens College Manchester, where he collaborated with W.H. Perkin Jr. on various organic synthesis projects. He made important discoveries in the synthesis of caronic acid and camphoric acid, and his work on the chemistry of glutaconic acids and imino-compounds was groundbreaking. Thorpe eventually became a professor of organic chemistry at Imperial College of Science and Technology in London, where he continued his research and influenced future generations of chemists.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
