They found that the polymerization process occurs through a free-radical chain mechanism, and the degree of crosslinking or degradation depends on the total radiation dose rather than the radiation intensity. The authors also investigated the effects of various factors, such as additives, oxygen, and temperature, on the polymerization process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
