He described the preparation process and analyzed the composition of Aurum mosaicum, discovering that it contains tin, sulfur, and other elements. Woulfe also studied the properties of Aurum mosaicum, such as its reaction with acids, alkalis, and its incompatibility with iron filings during distillation. His experiments provided insights into the composition and behavior of this ancient chemical compound.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alchemy"}
