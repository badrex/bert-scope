They discovered that when the external yield stress is exceeded, a new type of secondary internal stress is produced by the process of plastic flow. This stress is permanent and can be measured by the residual lattice strains exhibited by the lattice after the removal of the external stress. The authors also found that the maximum residual internal strain developed by the lattice increases with the fineness to which the crystals can be broken down by plastic deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
