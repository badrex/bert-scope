It found that the anaerobic heat production of human spermatozoa is higher than that of bull spermatozoa, and up to two-thirds of the heat production of human semen comes from the seminal plasma. The anaerobic heat production of human seminal plasma is more than fifty times greater than that of bull seminal plasma. These findings suggest that differences in sperm metabolism between humans and bulls are quantitative, not qualitative.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
