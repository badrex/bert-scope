The author explores the factors affecting the rate of movement in the capillary electrometer and develops a new method for analyzing the data. The study demonstrates the electrometer's ability to detect and differentiate between sudden and gradual changes in electrical potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
