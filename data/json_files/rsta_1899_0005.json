Poynting and P.L. Gray to investigate the potential directive action of one quartz crystal on another. They used a torsion balance to measure any possible force between the crystals, but found no evidence of a directive action. The experiment set a superior limit on the value of any such force, if it exists, and contributed to the understanding of crystal physics and electromagnetism."}
