They created a model with different wheel sizes and tested its performance on various surfaces. The results showed that larger wheels were more efficient in drawing the model over obstacles and suggested that wagons with high front wheels and fixed thills would be easier to draw on rough terrain.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
