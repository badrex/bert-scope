The results show that oocytes possess a carrier-mediated system for folate uptake, with an apparent Km of 42 nM and Vmax of 10.56 fmol per oocyte per 2 hours. The uptake process is independent of Na+ and highly pH-dependent, with severe inhibition occurring at pH lower than 6.5. This research may help further our understanding of folate movement across biological membranes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Molecular Biology"}
