However, meiotic duration is not solely determined by DNA content but is also influenced by chromosomal organization, DNA structure, and the organism's developmental pattern. The study suggests that DNA affects development both through its informational content and through its physical mechanical effects, independent of its informational content.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
