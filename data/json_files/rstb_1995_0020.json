Bacteria with varying morphologies were found between the microvilli of the epidermal cells, and modified epidermal cells called bacteriocytes were detected in the mantle roof and post-oral tentacles. The symbiotic bacteria may be involved in recycling dissolved organic matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
