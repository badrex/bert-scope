The vertical lobe system receives inputs from various sources, including the optic lobes, arms, mouth, and skin receptors. The output of this system includes large neurons that control movements of attack or retreat, as well as connections to the optic lobes. The author also discusses the differences between the vertical lobe systems of Loligo and Sepia, as well as the challenges of studying decapod brains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
