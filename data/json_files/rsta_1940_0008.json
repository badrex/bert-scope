The authors collected data from bore-holes and outcrops, creating contoured maps showing the depths of various horizons and the thicknesses of rock between them. They also provide a map of the Palaeozoic floor's shape and discuss its composition based on re-examined bore-hole cores and seismic velocities.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
