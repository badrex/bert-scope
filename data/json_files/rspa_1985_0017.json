They developed a semi-empirical equation to calculate the mercury pumping pressures for any given set of conditions and tested it against their measurements. This work reestablishes the accuracy and reliability of the McLeod-gauge-cold-trap system for measuring low gas pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Metrology"}
