It explores the factors influencing membrane lipid behavior and develops a phase-separation model to explain the response of biological membranes to stress. The article also examines the role of cryoprotectants in stabilizing membrane organization at low temperatures and preserving the balance of interactions between membrane components.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}
