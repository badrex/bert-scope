They used a modified Pitot tube to measure the fluid's velocity close to the wall and found evidence of a thin layer of fluid in streamline motion near the boundary. The results suggest that there might be a finite amount of slip at the boundary, but further research is needed to confirm this.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
