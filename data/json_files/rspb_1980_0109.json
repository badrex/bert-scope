The author develops a theory that explains how auxin moves through the interior of cells and how it passes between cells, considering factors such as diffusion, permeability, and concentration gradients. This phenomenon plays a crucial role in plant growth and development, including tropic responses and the formation of vascular tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
