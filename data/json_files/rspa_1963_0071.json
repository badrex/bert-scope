They introduce a Cartesian basis where all three components of the oscillator Hamiltonian are separately diagonal, simplifying the construction of wave functions and the projection of states from a single intrinsic function. This method is applied to the calculation of spectra for even-even nuclei in the mass region 1.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
