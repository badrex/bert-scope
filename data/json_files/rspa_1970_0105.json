They used a grazing incidence mirror system to focus X-rays onto a proportional counter, enabling the detection of X-ray spectra from both quiet and active coronal regions. The instrument was launched on two Skylark rocket flights, providing valuable data for solar research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
