They account for tidal dissipation along coastlines and develop a fast iterative method to evaluate the secondary effects of tidal loading and self-attraction. The results show improved agreement between theoretical and observed tides, with the theoretical tidal phases generally within one hour of the observed values.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
