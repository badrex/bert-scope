SEA is a system of linear equations that describe the energy flow between substructures and can be used to calculate loss factors, coupling loss factors, or net energy flows. The article presents possible applications of SEA in buildings, ships, vehicles, and machines, and demonstrates how it can help optimize noise control and identify the most effective paths for sound transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Acoustics and Vibration"}
