They aimed for a measurement accurate to 1 or 2 parts in 10,000 and used a combination of a silver voltameter, resistance coil, and standard cell to measure the current. The results provided a direct comparison between the value of the magnetic field from absolute magnetic measurements and the value of the field produced by a known current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
