They discuss the accuracy of the method, the estimation and elimination of errors, and provide tables of constants to facilitate its use. The authors also present results on the density of saturated steam at atmospheric pressures and discuss its implications for the displacement effect on the apparent weight of substances transferred from air to steam."}
