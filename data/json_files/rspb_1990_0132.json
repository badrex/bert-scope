The results provide evidence for low-ammonium concentration in the perialgal space, suggesting that the host maintains a low ambient ammonium concentration due to a restricted supply from the host. This finding contributes to understanding the role of nitrogen in regulating the symbiotic population in the green hydra association.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis and Ecology"}
