This model suggests a mechanism for the maintenance of genetic variation and shows a relationship between population size and heterozygosity, which is different from the purely neutral model. The study has implications for understanding the dynamics of genes and phenotypes in natural populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
