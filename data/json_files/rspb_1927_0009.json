They observed that two types of hyphae, \"A\" and \"B,\" exist in the fungi and can fuse, creating a new hybrid hypha. This research helps to understand the complex sexual reproduction and genetics of smut fungi.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
