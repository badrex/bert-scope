They discovered that the increased phagocytosis associated with immunization is due to the development of opsonins in the blood fluids, rather than a modification of white blood cells. This research helps in understanding the body's immune response to bacterial infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
