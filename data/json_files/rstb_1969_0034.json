They analyze distribution patterns, species-area relationships, and the impact of island size and isolation on endemicity. The authors also consider the implications of the Island Theory of Biogeography and discuss the need for further research on the region's geology and fauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Biogeography"}
