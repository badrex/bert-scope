It discusses the impact of parasites on host populations and the role of virulence and transmissibility in the coevolutionary process. The study combines mathematical models and empirical evidence to understand the complex interactions between parasites and their hosts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
