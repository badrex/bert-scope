They discovered that the sensitivity of an explosive is highly dependent on the pressure ratio and that the adiabatic compression and heating of trapped gas during impact is responsible for initiating explosions. The study also found that the nature of the included gas plays a crucial role in the explosion efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
