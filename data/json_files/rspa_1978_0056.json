They demonstrate how to create a sufficiently large zero-free area to obtain a good approximation of the actual phase, leading to a new interpretation of Gibbs' and speckle phenomena. The study focuses on one-dimensional cases and assumes that the object wave is of finite extent.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Complex Analysis"}
