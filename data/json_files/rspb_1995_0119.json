The geese had limited climbing rates, indicating size-dependent power limitations. Their flight tracks were irregular, suggesting a combination of landmark piloting and a compass mechanism for orientation. This study provides insights into the challenges birds face during extreme migrations and the strategies they use to navigate complex environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
