The growth is stopped when two active polymers collide. Oxygen acts as a powerful inhibitor, changing the kinetics of the reaction. The energy of activation for the addition reaction is 4 kcal, and the overall energy of activation for the polymerization reaction is negative.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
