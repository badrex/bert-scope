The instrument is more sensitive than the thermopile and bolometer, and it has potential applications in spectroscopic work. The author discusses the design, materials, and principles behind the Radio-micrometer, as well as its advantages and limitations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Instrumentation"}
