Experiments on dogs and clinical trials on patients showed that PGI2, when combined with heparin, effectively maintained platelet numbers and aggregability, reducing blood loss and the need for additional heparin doses. The use of PGI2 also prevented the release of circulating cardiotoxic factors during bypass and maintained perfusion pressure without the need for additional fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
