They discovered a strong continuous spectrum with three distinct bands in the yellow-green, green, and greenish-blue regions. The spectrum's appearance was different from that of ordinary carbon compounds, with the maximum intensity appearing closer to the nucleus. The authors also discussed the possible reasons for differences in the comet's spectrum observed in various photographs, such as atmospheric absorption, optical differences in instruments, or changes in the cometary radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
