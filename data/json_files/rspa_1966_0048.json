The authors develop a dynamic loading machine that allows for deformation of beam specimens at various speeds, with strain rates up to 20. They perform dynamic flexure tests on a carbon steel and compare the results with dynamic compression tests on the same material. The findings show that the behavior in bending exhibits features not predictable from compression test data."}
