They provide detailed calculations for pipes of circular cross-section, including friction loss factors and velocity contours. The results show favorable agreements with existing experimental data and recent numerical solutions based on the Navier-Stokes equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
