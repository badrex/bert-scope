The study found that the shelled Sacoglossa is a monophyletic group, while the non-shelled Sacoglossa is also a monophyletic group. The author proposed a classificatory framework based on shared derived characters and discussed various classification issues within the Sacoglossa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Malacology"}
