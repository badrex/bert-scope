Gray made significant contributions to the understanding of the interaction of radiation with matter and the absorption of hard X-rays. His work led to the discovery of the annihilation of a positive and negative electron, opening a new chapter in physics. Gray's life and career are explored, from his early interests in science and mathematics to his time at Trinity College, Cambridge, and his membership in the Cavendish Laboratory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
