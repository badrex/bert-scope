They discover that the stems previously thought to be Sigillarian actually belong to Lepidodendroid trees. The author also discusses the discovery of new specimens, the structure of Calamostachys, and the classification of fern petioles or stems. Additionally, they investigate the nature of cryptogamic conceptacles and Traquairia, and provide insights into the affinities of these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
