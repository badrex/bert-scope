The authors found that infusing ADP-releasing enzymes or ADP-receptor antagonists into the blood significantly increased bleeding times in rats, suggesting that ADP plays a crucial role in the process of hemostasis by accelerating platelet aggregation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
