The authors use electrophoresis and other techniques to analyze histones from various tissues and species, discovering that they are generally composed of multiple components. They also study the differences in histones from normal and malignant cells, providing evidence for cell specificity and the role of histones in tumor development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
