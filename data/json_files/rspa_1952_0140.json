The authors develop a method to analyze the creep curve and demonstrate that the effect of interruptions can be expressed in terms of a single parameter. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of materials under stress and can be applied to various engineering and technological applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Material Science"}
