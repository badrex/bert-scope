The experimental results showed discrepancies between the independent particle model predictions and the observed data, indicating the importance of electron-electron correlation processes. The findings confirm similar discrepancies reported for Xe I and suggest that continuous absorption beyond the edges remains significant at energies several hundreds of electron volts above the thresholds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
