The authors use a combination of a Wilson sphere and an electrometer triode to study the changes in the electric field and analyze the wave-forms of atmospherics. They find that the high-frequency components of atmospherics travel with a higher group velocity than the low-frequency components, and that the ratio of the radiation field to the electrostatic field increases with distance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
