Garrod's research on alkaptonuria, a rare metabolic disorder, laid the foundation for the field of human biochemical genetics. His ideas on biochemical individuality and disease were ahead of his time and only gained recognition after his death. The article highlights Garrod's contributions to science and the development of the field over the years.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
