The author identifies the primary xylem structure and discusses the presence of medullary tracheides, which are elongated elements that extend throughout the \"pith.\" This discovery suggests that the plant's structure was protostelic, with xylem intermixed with parenchyma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
