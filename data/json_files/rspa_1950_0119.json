It discusses the effects of hybridization on bond strength, electronegativity, and molecular properties. The author also investigates the extent of second-order hybridization in molecules like NH and OH, analyzing the consequences of the concept using a generalized atomic orbital approximation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Chemistry"}
