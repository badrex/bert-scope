Two types of promastigotes, nectomonads and haptomonads, were found in the midgut, with differences in their ultrastructure. The researchers also observed a preliminary structure of organisms in the pharynx, which supports the idea that parasites in this site attach via hemidesmosomes. The findings suggest that cultured forms of Leishmania should not be considered identical to those in the vector.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
