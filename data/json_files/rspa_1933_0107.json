They investigated the applicability of the Helmholtz-Kirchhoff expression for the relation between the free-space velocity and the tube velocity in a gas. The experiments involved six gases with varying viscosities and densities, and six tubes made of different materials (glass, copper, and carbon). The results provide a comprehensive understanding of the factors affecting sound velocity in gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
