The organism's movement is unique and has not been observed in other spiral-shaped organisms. The author discusses the organism's structure, movement, and possible systematic position, suggesting a relationship with Spirochaetoidea and Cyanophyceae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protistology"}
