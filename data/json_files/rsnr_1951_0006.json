Strange's marginal notes in a book about the geography of Neuchatel and Valangin provide valuable insights into his understanding of the region's geological and palaeontological features. His observations on fossils, minerals, and other natural phenomena showcase his accurate and forward-thinking contributions to the scientific community of his time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Palaeontology"}
