Researchers found that inhibitors of the sodium pump can block memory formation only if present during the learning process, while inhibitors of protein synthesis can prevent long-term memory formation even when administered after learning. These findings suggest that there are at least two stages in memory formation: a short-term phase dependent on membrane mechanisms and a permanent storage phase dependent on protein synthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Memory and Learning"}
