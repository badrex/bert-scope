They discovered that the dehydration process consists of a series of stages, with sudden changes in the rate of dehydration at specific points corresponding to the formation of definite hydrates. The authors observed different types of behavior in the dehydration process, depending on factors such as the rate and freedom of water evaporation. They discuss the possible explanations for these observations in terms of crystal structure and heterogeneous dissociation theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
