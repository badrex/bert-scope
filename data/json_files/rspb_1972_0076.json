They found that small, non-dividing lymphocytes carry the property of immunological memory, while large, dividing lymphocytes do not. The study used velocity sedimentation and glass bead columns to separate and analyze lymphocyte fractions in rats immunized to tetanus toxoid. The results showed that immunological memory is carried by small, non-dividing lymphocytes, providing no grounds for supposing that large, dividing lymphocytes also possess this property.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
