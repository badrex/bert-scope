They discover that the interface between two fluids is stable or unstable depending on the direction of motion, with the interface being unstable when the motion is from the more viscous to the less viscous fluid. This phenomenon has implications for oil extraction and the behavior of fluids in porous materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
