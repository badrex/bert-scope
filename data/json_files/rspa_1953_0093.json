They tested nitrogen, ethylene, carbon dioxide, and nitrous oxide in the range of 1 to 45 atm. The results agreed with other direct measurements and adiabatic Joule-Thomson and compressibility data. This method provides a direct measure of the deviations from ideal behavior and helps in understanding intermolecular forces between like and unlike molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
