The study demonstrates that all barium, caesium, and rubidium can be successfully incorporated into hollandite when certain conditions are met, ensuring the safety of radioactive waste management. The article also discusses the crystal chemistry and solid-solution relationships of the hollandite series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
