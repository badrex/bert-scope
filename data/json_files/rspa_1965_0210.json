Although there is no experimental evidence for these bosons at the time, the author argues that a field theory with vectorial intermediate bosons can serve as a useful model for understanding group properties and other aspects of weak interactions. The author also explores the possibility of using parity-violating nuclear interactions as a test to differentiate between different theories of weak interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
