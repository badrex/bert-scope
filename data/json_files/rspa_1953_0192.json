The authors formulate the problem in terms of the scattering of electromagnetic waves by a periodically perturbed medium, leading to an integral equation. They solve this equation using a trial solution for the electric disturbance in the form of a double infinity of plane waves. The authors derive expressions for the intensities of the diffracted spectra and discuss various approximations and applications of their theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave Optics"}
