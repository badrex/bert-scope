He used thermometers to measure temperature in the shade and sunlight, and noticed that the temperature dropped as the eclipse progressed. The temperature in the sunshine reached its lowest point after the moment of greatest obscuration. The author also noted the influence of clouds on temperature during the partial eclipse in 1867.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
