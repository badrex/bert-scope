The authors explore the role of 8,14-diene sterols as precursors in cholesterol synthesis and provide evidence for their involvement in the process. They also analyze the fate of the 15a-hydrogen during the conversion of lanosterol to cholesterol and the role of A8(14) sterols in cholesterol biosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
