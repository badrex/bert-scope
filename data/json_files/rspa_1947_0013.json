They find that the experimental results can be reproduced using acceptable wave functions, and discuss the main features of the cross-section-energy curve. The calculated photo-ionization cross-sections for atomic potassium with various assumed polarizabilities are provided in a table.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
