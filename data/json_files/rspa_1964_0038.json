They examined the existing classification of the spectrum and provided new data for further research. The study confirmed the inversion of the odd-even staggering phenomenon for the first time and revealed the odd isotopes' hyperfine structures in one of the lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
