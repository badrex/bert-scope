By studying the effects of indole acetic acid (IAA) and benzimidazole (BIA) on pea epicotyl sections, they found that changes in cell wall structure, specifically the arrangement of cellulose microfibrils, play a significant role in determining cell shape. This research has implications for understanding cell and tissue differentiation and the mechanisms behind plant growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
