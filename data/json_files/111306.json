They discovered that the mucous membrane acts as a catalytic body, altering the molecular structure of bile and affecting the taste and properties of the fluid. The author also found that the mucous membrane has similar catalytic influences on other fluids, such as milk and honey, and can change the molecular structure of cane sugar.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
