Pigott aimed to determine the longitude and latitude of Louvain, a significant university in the region. He collected observations of Jupiter's satellites and compared them to observations made in other locations to minimize errors. Pigott also provided details on the instruments and methods used, including the meridian zenith distances of the Sun and stars, and the reflector, telescope, and achromatic treble-object glass used for satellite observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Geodesy"}
