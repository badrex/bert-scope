They found that tumor cells have a lower percentage of coagulable nitrogen compared to the host's cells, indicating a difference in their chemical composition. This suggests that cancer cells grow more rapidly than the host's cells, as they require less protein to build up a larger mass. These findings are important for understanding the chemistry and metabolism of cancer cells and their growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Research"}
