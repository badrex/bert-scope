They found that the magnetic intensity was affected by the Aurora Borealis and meteorological causes. The author also proposed that electrical currents under and above the Earth's surface might be responsible for the changes in the magnetic needle's intensity and direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
