They discovered that heat is evolved during gelation and that the rate of cooling decreases with increasing gelatin concentration. This research provides insights into the mechanism of gel formation and the role of temperature, protein concentration, and hydrogen ion concentration in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
