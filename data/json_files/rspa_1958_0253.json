The authors calculate the specific average energy per ion pair for a small change in the beam energy and analyze the influence of electron capture and electron loss processes. They also investigate the behavior of the energy per ion pair at low energies and discuss the differences between electron and proton beams. The results provide insights into the ionization and stopping power of beams in atomic hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
