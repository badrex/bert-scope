The authors examine the flexural rigidity and initial torsional rigidity of the beams, which are crucial factors in determining the critical load causing lateral buckling. The research provides a theoretical and experimental analysis of these factors and their impact on the stability of the beams under load. The findings contribute to the development of design methods for steel structures based on the calculation of collapse loads.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
