They found that gases like oxygen, hydrogen, and carbonic acid gas had varying effects on the emission and intensity of light. The author also studied the behavior of solar light when absorbed by Canton's phosphorus, observing that it follows similar laws as other spontaneous light sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical properties and reactions"}
