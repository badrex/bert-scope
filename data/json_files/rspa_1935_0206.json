The authors develop a theory for calculating the accommodation coefficient, which measures the exchange of energy between gas molecules and a solid. They use Born-Dirac perturbation theory and consider the effects of the repulsive field between the gas molecule and the surface. The study includes calculations for hydrogen and oxygen molecules and provides insights into the energy transfer processes in gas-solid interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
