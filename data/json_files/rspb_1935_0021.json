They used the plate method to count the number of microorganisms falling on plates in various locations and under different conditions. The data was analyzed statistically to determine if the distribution followed a Poisson series. The study aimed to understand the principles governing the numerical distribution of microorganisms in the air and to interpret the results using methods of statistical analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
