The research shows that these postures have evolved to minimize aggression and fear, allowing the birds to form pairs successfully. This phenomenon is observed in many vertebrates that use territoriality to space out their habitats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
