The authors explain the mechanics of colloidal crystal formation and depletion attraction in the wall layers, and explore the self-assembly aspect of colloidal structures in biology. They also provide comparisons with Selaginella leaves and virus aggregates, and discuss the potential implications for evolution and entropy in organismal development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Development"}
