In the light-adapted state, light enters the ommatidium through a crystalline tract surrounded by pigment grains. In the dark-adapted state, the retinula cell nuclei and distal rhabdomere move to the cone tip, and the crystalline tract is drawn into the cone. This structure allows the lacewing to have a wide visual field and improve the signal-to-noise ratio in its neural mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
