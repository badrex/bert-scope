The authors establish isothermal sections at 640, 600, and 550\u00b0C and determine the fields of primary separation. They find that only two intermetallic phases, Co2Al9 and FeAl3, are recognized in these alloys. The results are discussed in relation to the theoretical considerations involved, revealing close analogies between different aluminium-rich alloy systems containing transitional metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
