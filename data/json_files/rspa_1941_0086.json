They found that large radicals are formed by the successive addition of olefine molecules to the primary radicals from the photolysis of the aldehyde or ketone. The polymer radicals undergo either a transfer process or give inactive products. The rate of polymerization is influenced by the type of olefine and the chain-ending process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
