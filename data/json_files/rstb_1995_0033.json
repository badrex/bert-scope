The author argues that the concept of locomotor mimicry is unparsimonious and that traditional mimicry theories can explain the observed patterns in butterfly flight and morphology. The author suggests that alternative hypotheses, such as phylogenetic constraints, can better explain the distribution of characters among butterfly species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
