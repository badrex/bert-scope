They found that the density of artificial ice is about 0.916 gram per cubic centimeter, while natural ice has a density more than one part in a thousand greater. The study also showed that the same specimen of water can freeze into ice with different densities, limiting the accuracy of the Bunsen ice calorimeter in absolute determinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Cryology"}
