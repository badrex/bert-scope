The author explores the development and decay of turbulence in the late stages of gravitational collapse of rapidly rotating systems, which could be an efficient mechanism for converting gravitational energy into other forms. The study considers the role of hydrodynamic instability and the impact of turbulence on the properties of condensed systems, such as neutron stars and Seyfert galaxies. The findings have implications for understanding energy conversion processes in astrophysical contexts."}
