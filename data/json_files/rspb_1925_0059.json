They observe that the malignant condition in tar tumours arises in small isolated foci and that the degree of differentiation of epidermal cells varies. The study also highlights the abnormal conditions of epidermal cells, such as hypertrophy and degeneration, and their relation to tumour growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
