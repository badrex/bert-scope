They discovered that the electron emission and ionization of the metal vapor were influenced by the filament's temperature and the surface properties. The findings supported Saha's equation and the Sackur-Tetrode value of the chemical constant in ionization processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
