He explains the process of taking out embryos from eggs and preserving them in glass containers filled with spirit of wine. This method allows for observation of the development stages of embryos and can be applied to other fetus samples. Boyle also discusses some variations of the method and shares his experiences with preserving embryos.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
