Urari causes rapid death when injected into the blood or inserted into a wound, while strychnia paralyzes motor nerves by overstimulating them. Both poisons affect the nervous system, but not the sensory nerves. The author also observed that artificial respiration can help restore animals poisoned with urari.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
