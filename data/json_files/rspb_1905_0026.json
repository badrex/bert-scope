They find that decerebrate rigidity is independent of the pyramidal system and that the inhibitory center lies in the thalamus. The cerebellum has no influence on decerebrate rigidity, and the adjuvant center is Deiter's nucleus. The results show that the cerebellum, through its peduncles, controls skeletal muscles, mainly those of the trunk and girdles.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Thalamus and Cerebellum"}
