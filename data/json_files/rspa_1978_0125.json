They discovered 110 new features and identified them by comparing with Cd II energy levels, Hartree-Fock calculations, and the Zn I absorption spectrum. The analysis showed that double-electron excitation through excited-state configuration mixing dominates in cadmium, similar to zinc.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
