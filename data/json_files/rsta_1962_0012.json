The authors fit the Fermi surfaces to experimental data and compare them with other properties like the anomalous skin effect and magneto-acoustic oscillations. The results show that the same Fermi surface can account for both the de Haas-van Alphen effect and the anomalous skin effect, providing a better understanding of these metals' properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
