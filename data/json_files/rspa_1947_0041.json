They discovered that the energy collected from the gas was much higher than expected, suggesting that every molecule in the gas must be excited to a significant extent. This phenomenon was observed in various gases, including nitrogen, oxygen, and hydrogen, and could not be explained by current theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
