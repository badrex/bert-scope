The author finds that the annual variation of the declination range at Trevandrum has two minima and two maxima, with the character of the diurnal variation changing around the equinoxes. The author also investigates the long-period variation and planetary periods, finding similarities with the Kew observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
