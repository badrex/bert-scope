The author establishes a relation between the area of a spherical ellipse and the length of the spherical ellipse generated by the intersection of a supplemental cone with the same sphere. The paper also explores properties of the spherical ellipse and its analogy to plane curves, as well as the quadrature of the surface of a cone of the second degree.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
