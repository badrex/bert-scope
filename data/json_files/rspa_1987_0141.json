They found that irradiation led to the suppression of domain wall pinning in annealed material and reduced thermal stability in cold-worked irradiated a-iron. The results suggest that these techniques can provide valuable information to complement more conventional methods for characterizing low-dose irradiation effects in a-iron.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Materials Characterization"}
