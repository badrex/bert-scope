He also examines the disruptive electrical discharge, or glow, and its relation to brushes and sparks. Faraday explores the phenomena in various conditions, such as gases, liquids, and solids, and discusses the connection between electrolytic discharge and conduction. Lastly, he touches upon the inductive and magnetic phenomena related to electric currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
