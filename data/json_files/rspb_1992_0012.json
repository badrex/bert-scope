PPAR mRNA is found in the liver and brown fat from the fetal stage and post-natally in the heart, kidney, and gut. The upregulation of transcription of peroxisomal genes in specific tissues may play a role in cold adaptation, non-shivering thermogenesis, and detoxification.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
