This process occurs without external agitation or force and is influenced by the concentration of the detergent solution. The emulsion formed consists of spherical droplets, and the energy required for emulsification comes from the adsorption and solubilization of the hydrocarbon in the aqueous detergent.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
