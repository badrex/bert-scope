Auzout describes a method for determining the diameters of planets and the parallax of the Moon using observations of their positions in the sky. He also explains why the Moon's diameter appeared to increase during a solar eclipse, depending on the time of day and location. Additionally, he discusses the potential of Signior Burattini's optical glasses and his correspondence with M. Hevelius on the topic of comets.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Lunar Observations"}
