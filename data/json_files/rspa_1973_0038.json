They found that an increase in flow depth leads to a decrease in the bed-load transport rate due to the increase in the mean flow velocity. The study provides a consistent and comprehensive set of data on bed-load transport and associated flow quantities, allowing for a better understanding of the phenomenon and its implications in river engineering and geomorphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
