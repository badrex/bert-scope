The mouse minisatellite locus Ms6-hm has a germline mutation rate of 2.5% per gamete, making it one of the most unstable loci in the mouse genome. The research also explores the DNA sequence flanking the locus and the mechanisms involved in new-length allele generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
