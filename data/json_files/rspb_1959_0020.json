They discovered that the Last Glaciation ice extended south of the Humber as far as north Norfolk, with a lobe pushing into the Wash. This conclusion reasserts the traditional southern limit of the Last Glaciation ice in eastern England, which had been doubted by some authors based on topographical inference alone.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Stratigraphy"}
