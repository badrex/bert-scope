They show that all shears of this kind can be derived from unimodular correspondence matrices satisfying certain restrictions. The authors discuss the form of these matrices for primitive and centred lattices and examine relationships between shear modes associated with closely related matrices. They also present a convenient method of choosing unimodular matrices and provide a table of such matrices for various lattices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
