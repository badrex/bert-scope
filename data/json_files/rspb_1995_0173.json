These changes may increase the risk of developing diseases such as coronary heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and hypertension later in life. The author presents evidence from various studies that support this theory and highlights the importance of understanding the role of intrauterine environment in adult health.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Epidemiology"}
