They found that a membrane of 0.2 \u00b5m effectively retained the virus. The author also developed a method to concentrate the virus and remove tissue proteins, which improved the optical transparency of the medium for microscopical studies. This research provided a better understanding of the virus and its detection through filtration and microscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
