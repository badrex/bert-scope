They find that the frictional force is proportional to the real area of contact and that the frictional properties of fibers are influenced by their surface chemistry. This research has implications for understanding processes such as carding, spinning, and felting of fibers, as well as the wearability of cloth.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
