They found that the average height of the ozone layer was about 50 km. There was some indication that the height might be greater in the spring, but this needed further investigation. The study also discussed the limitations of their instruments and the importance of more suitable instruments for future observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
