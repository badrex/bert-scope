They found that the well-drained soils along the Suia-Missu road were uniform, deep latosols (oxisols) with a dystrophic nature. The forest in the area was identified as Evergreen Seasonal forest of Amazonian type, located near the meeting place of the Amazonian forest and the cerrado (savanna) formation of Central Brazil. The authors also observed differences in forest types and soil characteristics in the area, such as the presence of swampy gallery forests in floodplains and the extension of forest into cerrado during the life of individual trees.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
