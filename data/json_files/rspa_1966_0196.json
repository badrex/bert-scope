The researchers used a high-speed digital computer to simulate the displacement and motion of atoms in the crystal lattice. They found that channelling of knocked-on lattice atoms in lead iodide may increase the mobility of point defects and explain electron microscope observations of fission fragment damage.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
