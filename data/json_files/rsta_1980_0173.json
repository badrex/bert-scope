It explores the challenges in detecting young galaxies and the factors that affect their detectability, such as redshift, dust absorption, and the presence of a young stellar population. The author also examines the properties of young galaxies, their morphological characteristics, and the potential for finding them in nearby clusters.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Galaxy Formation and Evolution"}
