It presents a classification of these proteins based on their chemical characteristics and genetic control, and explores their structural and evolutionary relationships. The study provides insights into the origin and evolution of these proteins and their importance in determining the nutritional and functional qualities of the grains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
