The research assumes the flow outside the vortex ring is irrotational and isentropic. The findings show that compressibility slows down the vortex ring, and the speed of propagation depends on the distribution of circulatory velocity and entropy within the core. The results extend the cut-off theory of filament motion to compressible fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
