They developed an elaborate but compact apparatus that allows for continuous generation and estimation of carbon dioxide, making it suitable for studying various aspects of plant physiology. This method enables the examination of different parts of a plant under controlled and contrasted conditions, providing valuable insights into plant processes."}
