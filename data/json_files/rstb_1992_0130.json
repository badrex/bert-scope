The authors review their recent measurements and explore the mechanisms and control of Ca2+ fluxes, their role in signal transduction, and the impact on cellular activities. They also discuss the challenges and techniques used in measuring these fluxes, including electrophysiological methods and radioisotopic approaches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
