They find that the figure is determined by the moment of inertia and angular velocity of the liquid, and that the potential energy of the system is related to its kinetic energy. This study contributes to understanding the behavior of rotating fluids and celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
