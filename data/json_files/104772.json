He observed the effects of these canes on the repulsion and attraction of various materials, such as feathers and paper. He also noticed differences in the behavior of vitreous and resinous effluvia, which may be related to their unctuous or sulphureous properties. These experiments provide insights into the nature of electricity and its effects on different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
