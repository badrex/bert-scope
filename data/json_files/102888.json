He found that these creatures had different shapes, sizes, and movements. Some of these animalcula reproduced and grew horns, while others had unique shapes and behaviors. The author also discussed the growth and reproduction of the green weeds, noting that they grow in shallow waters and are similar to other plants in their reproductive processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
