They explain the principles of water flow, velocity, and the effect of obstacles on the water's height and fall. The author's calculations show that the fall under London Bridge is 4 feet 9 inches and under Westminster Bridge is about 1 inch.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydraulics"}
