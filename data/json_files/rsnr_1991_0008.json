Maskelyne, the Astronomer Royal, played a crucial role in improving navigation by publishing the Nautical Almanac and tables for its use. His work led to the selection of the Greenwich meridian as the Prime Meridian of the world. Maskelyne also conducted the famous experiment to measure the Earth's gravitational mass by observing the gravitational deflection of a plumb-line produced by Schiehallion mountain in Scotland. His numerous scientific activities and personal life are also explored in the review.", "scientific_discipline": "History of Science > Navigation and Astronomy"}
