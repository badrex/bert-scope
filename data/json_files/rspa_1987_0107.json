The method uses adiabatic switching and can provide reasonable eigenvalue estimates even in the presence of classical chaos. The article also explores the distinction between adiabatic and geometric invariants and analyzes adiabatic switching for the standard map, showing that principal non-adiabaticities can be understood in terms of the Farey organization of rationals spanning the relevant range of winding numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Classical Mechanics"}
