They find that this eye is an invertebrate-like structure widely distributed among Lacertilians. The pineal eye is connected to the brain via a medianly placed nerve, and its presence and structure provide insights into the evolution of the eye and its various functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
