They observe the extrusion of nucleolar material into the cytoplasm, which they believe occurs through a process of budding off a part of the nucleus. This phenomenon is different from nuclear fragmentation and can be seen in living cells. The author also discusses the challenges of observing these processes in living cells and the changes they noticed in the appearance of the nucleolus and nuclear membrane when keeping cultures on a warm stage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
