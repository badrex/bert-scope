He explains that variations in the dip of the apparent horizon, which affect all observations of altitude at sea, can be influenced by this variable refraction. Wollaston also suggests a way to correct the error in nautical observations caused by assuming the horizon is always at the observer's height.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
