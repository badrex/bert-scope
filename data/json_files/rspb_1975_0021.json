The author explains the process of pollen tube rejection after incompatible pollination and the role of RNA and protein synthesis in the style. The article also explores the effects of temperature, light, and environmental factors on the incompatibility reaction, as well as the translocation patterns of soluble substances in pollinated flowers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
