They study the forces acting on the films and the intermolecular interactions between the molecules. The authors also observe a change in the properties of the films at higher temperatures, which they attribute to the separation of molecules due to thermal agitation. This change results in films with properties similar to a gas or vapor in two dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
