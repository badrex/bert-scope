The pancreas secretes a clear alkaline fluid that is isosmotic with blood, with sodium, potassium, and bicarbonate being the major ions. The study proposes that the cellular mechanisms involve carbonic anhydrase, proton pump, and hydrogen-sodium exchange carrier to maintain the secretion process. The pancreas responds to secretin, which stimulates a bicarbonate-rich fluid secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
