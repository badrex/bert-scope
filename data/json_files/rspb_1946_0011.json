The author finds that siderocytes appear in stored blood under adverse conditions and that their presence is associated with increased plasma iron and bile pigment levels, suggesting that both are derived from a special fraction of hemoglobin. The study also demonstrates a close correlation between siderocytosis, erythrocyte destruction, and urinary siderosis, as described by Peyton Rous in 1918. The author proposes that siderocyte counts could be applied to clinical medicine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
