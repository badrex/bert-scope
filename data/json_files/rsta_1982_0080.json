They find that the power spectral density function has a rapid increase up to periods of 10 years, followed by a plateau in the region of 1 to 100 years, and then a decline. The study provides insights into the continuous spectrum of the Earth's geomagnetic field and highlights the need for more comprehensive data sets with emphasis on archaeomagnetic and high-resolution deep-sea records.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
