The authors express the potential using a Green function and a distribution of sources over the body surface, written in terms of Legendre functions. They obtain numerical results for the tangential force, radial force, and lift on the sphere, moving in circles of various radii. The study sheds light on the underlying hydrodynamic phenomena associated with maneuvering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
