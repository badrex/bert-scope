A double dosage of DSS disrupts testis formation, while its absence is compatible with a male phenotype, suggesting a role for DSS in ovarian development and as a link between ovary and testis formation. The DSS locus was localized to a 160 kb region of Xp21, overlapping the adrenal hypoplasia congenita locus. The search for expressed sequences in the DSS critical region led to the identification of two types of genes: the DAM family and DAX-1, an atypical member of the nuclear receptor superfamily.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
