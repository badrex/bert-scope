The authors describe how rapid kinetic events during in vitro folding can be monitored and deciphered structurally, and how more detailed structural descriptions of intermediates can be obtained from NMR studies of stable, partly folded states. The findings from these studies help identify determinants of folding events and contribute to understanding the process of protein folding at the molecular level.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Structural Biology"}
