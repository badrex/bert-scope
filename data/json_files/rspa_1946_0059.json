They discovered that the resistance experienced by the cylinders is influenced by the distance of the fluid boundaries, and that Lamb's formula for drag is only applicable in an infinite or nearly infinite fluid. The experiments showed the existence of a purely viscous regime where fluid inertia can be neglected, and the resistance coefficient increases threefold as the distance to the boundaries increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
