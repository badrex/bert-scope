The authors describe the molecular pathology of these disorders, the role of restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) in carrier detection, and the experience with fetal DNA analysis for prenatal diagnosis. They also highlight the importance of understanding phenotype-genotype relationships and the use of RFLPs in the diagnosis of genetic diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
