The model considers a network of flexible long chains with both 'frozen' and'soft' components, allowing for deformation under stress. The new equation of state can be used to describe the behavior of materials with both low and high barriers to internal rotations in their chain backbones.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
