The author examines the role of electric current in initiating the disturbance and the relationship between the phenomena that precede, accompany, and follow the disturbance. The lecture highlights the importance of understanding the inter-relation between these phenomena to build a physico-chemical hypothesis for the nature of the nervous impulse.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
