The research found that biomass variability may be lower in more species-rich communities, and physiological stresses from low pH may explain the greater variability of plots with acidified soil. Three hypotheses are proposed to explain the relationship between species richness and biomass variability, which can be tested within the Park Grass Experiment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
