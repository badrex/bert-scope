The research confirms that anisotropy in hardness is an inherent property of all crystalline materials. The analysis establishes a relationship between the effective resolved shear stress, the crystal's bulk, and the observed hardness. The findings can be used to identify active slip systems in crystals where dislocations can move on more than one system.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
