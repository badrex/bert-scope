They use this method to analyze pairs of sites, groups of three sites forming equilateral triangles, and groups of four sites forming regular tetrahedra on a close-packed lattice. The study provides a better understanding of the energy of mixing and the configurational free energy in regular mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
