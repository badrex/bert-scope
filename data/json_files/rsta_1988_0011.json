It discusses the information that can be derived from such studies, using examples of diatomic and triatomic molecules like NC1, NF, and HNO. The article also explores the value of superheating in high-temperature photoelectron spectroscopy, using the example of sodium hydroxide monomers and dimers. The technique is capable of providing information on electronic states of molecular ions accessible from the neutral molecule by one-electron ionization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
