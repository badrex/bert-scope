They explore two scenarios for the Earth's current state: one where the exterior is a solid crust with the interior being a fluid mass, and another where the Earth is entirely solid. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the Earth's refrigeration process to determine its actual condition, but acknowledges the lack of experimental evidence to make a definitive conclusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
