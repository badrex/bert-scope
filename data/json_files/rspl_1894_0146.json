They discovered that black-damp is primarily composed of nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon dioxide, and causes respiratory distress when inhaled. The findings contribute to understanding the hazards of working in coal mines and improving safety measures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mine Safety"}
