Spectral analysis reveals the structure of large-scale planetary waves and their differences between the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The research also identifies westward-traveling wave 1 components with periods of 5.8, 8.3, and 12.3 days.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
