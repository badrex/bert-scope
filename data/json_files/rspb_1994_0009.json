They found that mammalian motor nerve terminals can be stained and destained with these dyes in an activity-dependent manner. The pattern of staining and destaining in mammalian terminals differs from that in frog neuromuscular junctions, and the timecourse of destaining reflects the rate of exocytosis and recycling of synaptic vesicles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
