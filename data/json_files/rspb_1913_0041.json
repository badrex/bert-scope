They find that excystation is influenced by temperature and pH, and that the cyst membranes are not made of starch, cellulose, glycogen, or paraglycogen. The study provides insights into the behavior of protozoa in the soil and their response to environmental factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology"}
