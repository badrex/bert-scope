They found that melamine has a layer structure, similar to other compounds with a cyanuric ring, and determined its principal refractive indices and optic axial angle. This research helps to understand the molecular structure and properties of melamine, which can be useful in its applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
