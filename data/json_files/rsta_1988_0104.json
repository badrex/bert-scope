The author presents methods for forming quaternary carbon centers, constructing subunits of glycopeptide antibiotics, and controlling stereochemistry in carbon-carbon bond formation. The article highlights the potential of these methods in the synthesis of complex molecules like trichothecenes, ristocetin A, and vancomycin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
