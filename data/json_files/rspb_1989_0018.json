The process involves fitting and clipping the spacer skeletons to the designated ligand points within the accessible surface of the ligand-binding site. The resulting molecular templates can be further optimized and verified for bonding integrity, providing a foundation for automated site-directed drug design.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Drug Design"}
