They found that the formation of these connections is dependent on a process where regions of the two tecta that receive similar spatiotemporal patterns of excitation become neurally interconnected. This study provides insights into the development of specific neuronal connections in the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
