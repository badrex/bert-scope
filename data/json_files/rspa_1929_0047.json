The authors discovered that at low pressures, the ignition of hydrogen and oxygen depends on the establishment of non-stationary reaction chains. They also found that the critical pressure for ignition is influenced by temperature, concentration, and the presence of foreign gases like argon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
