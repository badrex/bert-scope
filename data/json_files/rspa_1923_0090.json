This method allows for a direct study of individual quanta and provides valuable information about the point of origin, direction, range, and ionization of the particles. The author also discusses improvements made to the cloud chamber and the techniques used to produce and study the radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ionizing Radiation and Particle Physics"}
