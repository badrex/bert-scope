They explain the mechanism of echo formation, the effects of diffusion, and the modulation effects of coupling and chemical shift on spin-echo amplitude. The results are applicable to nuclear magnetic resonance experiments and can be extended to systems with multiple pulses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
