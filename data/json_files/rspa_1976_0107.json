The authors found that two transitions occur in two-phase samples, corresponding to the eutectic and proeutectic constituents of the alloys. The surface resistance remains almost constant between these transitions. The height of the plateau between the transitions varies with the alloy's composition and annealing conditions. The authors discuss the results in terms of the flow of current in such systems and the proximity effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
