They describe two methods of polyp formation: intra-tentacular budding, where new polyps develop within the tentacles of older polyps, and extra-tentacular budding, where new polyps form outside the tentacles. The study provides a detailed analysis of the process of colony formation and polyp development in these corals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Coral Biology"}
