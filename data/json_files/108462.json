He observed the diffusion rates of various substances, such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, and hydriodic acid, and found that they have similar diffusibilities despite having different physical properties. The study also includes the diffusion of other substances like bromine, hydrocyanic acid, and nitric acid, providing valuable data for understanding the behavior of liquids in various concentrations and temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Diffusion and Chemical Properties"}
