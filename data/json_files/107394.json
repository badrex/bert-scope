They discovered that the gastric glands possess the power of coagulating milk, which is the first change food undergoes in the process of digestion. This coagulation is also found in other parts of the stomach, such as the mucus and the inner membrane, and is essential for the digestion process in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Digestion and Nutrition"}
