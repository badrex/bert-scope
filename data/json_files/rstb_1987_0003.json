The organs show great variation in number and structure, with no correlation found with systematics or ecological factors. The osphradial sense organs are considered chemoreceptors due to the presence of paddle cilia. A role in sexual biology, such as coordinating spawning, is suggested for Caudofoveata, while the role in Solenogastres remains unclear.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Molluscs"}
