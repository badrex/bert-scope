The researchers found two main types of fluctuations: short-period fluctuations with periods of a few seconds and long-period fluctuations with periods ranging from 0 to several minutes. The short-period fluctuations near the bottom are believed to be evidence of turbulence associated with bottom friction, marking the first experimental establishment of such turbulent velocity fluctuations in the sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
