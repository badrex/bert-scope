They describe methods to avoid complications in intertraction experiments and demonstrate different types of intertraction, including vertical and horizontal. The study provides insights into the behavior of cells and their components during intertraction, which can help in understanding cellular processes and movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
