They analyzed the differential cross-sections of uranium, aluminum, silver, tungsten, and lead at various angles. The results showed that Delbruck scattering and Rayleigh scattering contributed to the elastic scattering of high-energy photons, with Delbruck scattering being slightly more sharply peaked than the cross-section predicted by an approximate theory of Bethe and Rohrlich.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
