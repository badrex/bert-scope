The author constructs simple time budget models to estimate the value of energy released by mass loss and finds that the transfer of energy has an efficiency typically less than one. The analysis also provides a new result about optimal flight speed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
