He describes the properties of this fluid, including its attraction and repulsion of other matter, and discusses the consequences of these properties. Cavendish also examines the behavior of electrically charged bodies and how they interact with the electric fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
