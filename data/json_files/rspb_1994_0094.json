The researchers found that serotonin acts on 5HT1a receptors to enhance the duration and intensity of motor bursts during swimming. This discovery provides insight into the development and maintenance of a bursty motor pattern in these animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
