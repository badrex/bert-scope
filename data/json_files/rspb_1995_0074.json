They found that patients with artificial intra-ocular lenses could perceive motion in the figure, supporting the idea that activity in specific visual areas of the cerebral cortex endows the figure with its phenomenal properties of motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Perception"}
