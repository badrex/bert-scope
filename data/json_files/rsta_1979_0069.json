They discuss the symmetry of patterns created by the lattices of the two component crystals and the variation of bicrystal point symmetry with relative displacement of the adjacent crystals. The study also considers the physical properties of bicrystals, particularly their interfacial properties, and the symmetry of interfacial dislocation networks.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
