They prove the limiting absorption principle, establish the existence of solutions to exterior boundary-value problems, and show that the associated wave operators exist. This enables them to analyze the asymptotic behavior of time-dependent solutions of the exterior problem in terms of the reference problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
