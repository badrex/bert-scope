They discovered a broad absorption maximum in the photoionization continuum and identified discrete structure associated with the excitation of a -subshell electron. The results provide insights into inner shell photoionization processes and potential barrier phenomena, which can be further studied to understand atomic physics and spectroscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
