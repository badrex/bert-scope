They used chromosome arm volumes and centromere positions to analyze the spatial order of chromosomes in four grass species. The predicted order was among the top 5% of orders in all species, demonstrating the effectiveness of the model and analysis. This test can be applied to other materials with simple haploid genomes containing between six and about ten biarmed chromosomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
