They explore the factors that influence the minimum ignition energy and identify two ignition mechanisms: contact and gaseous discharges. The study reveals that the sensitivity of primary explosives to these discharges depends on the physical and electrical characteristics of the discharge system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
