They find that freezing below -15\u00b0C destroys the ganglion's function, but after treating with glycerol, the ganglion can withstand cooling to -76\u00b0C and recover normal responses to electrical stimulation. The study shows the potential for glycerol to protect mammalian cells and tissues during freezing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Physiology"}
