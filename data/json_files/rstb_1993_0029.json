The chaperonin consists of homologues to GroEL (cpn 60) and GroES (cpn 10) and shows a bullet-like shape in electron microscopy. The chaperonin's ability to induce productive folding, slow down folding rates, and arrest folding at different temperature ranges is discussed. The article also proposes a \"folding intermediate reservoir\" model to explain the chaperonin's function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
