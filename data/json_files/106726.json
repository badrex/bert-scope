He found that the acid has two distinct types of congelation and that the freezing point is determined by the acid's density. By exposing the acid to different temperatures and densities, Keir discovered that the optimal freezing point is around a specific density, and a small variation above or below this point renders the acid incapable of freezing without a significant increase in cold.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Properties"}
