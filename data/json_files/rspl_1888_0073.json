They found that the intensity of magnetism in wrought iron remained constant at about 1700 c.g.s. units, even when the magnetic force was varied from 2000 to 20000 c.g.s. units. The study also investigated the saturation values of various metals and the magnetic permeability of manganese steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
