It explains the benefits of polyploidy in developing race and species hybrids, and the importance of chromosome number and breeding system in successful plant breeding programs. The authors also explore the potential of polyploidy in breeding for agronomic flexibility in grasses, specifically in Lolium and Festuca species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
