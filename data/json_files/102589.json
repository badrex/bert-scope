He discusses the effects of foggy weather and the north wind on the mercury's rise and suggests that the cause might be the increase of the atmosphere's weight due to the addition of heavy vapors found in fog. Derham also proposes adding columns for thermometer readings and cloud movement to his observations to better understand the reasons behind the mercury's variations."}
