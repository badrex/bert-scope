The authors propose that the folding of polypeptide chains in muscles can be seen as a stage in the formation of globular proteins, and that thermokinetic forces and rubber-like elasticity contribute to muscle tension and elasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
