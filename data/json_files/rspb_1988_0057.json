The study used electron diffraction and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy to analyze the structure and growth of these calcite crystals. The findings provide insights into the biomineralization process and the molecular interactions between organic molecules and inorganic minerals in biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomineralization"}
