Age and size data were derived from statolith analysis, allowing researchers to understand the squid's growth and maturation process from recruitment into the fishery to the time they depart to spawn. The findings reveal differences in growth rates and size between males and females, as well as the allocation of resources during sexual maturation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
