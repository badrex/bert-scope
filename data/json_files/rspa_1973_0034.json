They demonstrate how to choose a coordinate system that simplifies the form of the vectors of the congruence and discuss the freedom in the choice of the coordinate system. This coordinate system does not generally admit a physical interpretation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
