The fetus was contained within the ovary's cavity, and the placenta and corpus luteum were present, indicating that conception occurred within the ovary. This case offers a unique opportunity to study the anatomy and pathology of the reproductive system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive System"}
