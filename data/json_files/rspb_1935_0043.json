They found that the rate of carbon dioxide production initially increased, then rapidly decreased during the yellowing phase, and finally fell sharply as the leaves browned and died. The authors also detected various hexose carbohydrates, such as glucose, fructose, sucrose, and fructosan, in the leaves, and observed differences in their concentrations between two different growing seasons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
