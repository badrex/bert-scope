They measured the density of the vapor and liquid, as well as the heat absorbed during the change of state from liquid to gas. Their findings contribute to understanding the behavior of substances undergoing chemical dissociation and evaporation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
