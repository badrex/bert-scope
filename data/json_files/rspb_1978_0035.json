The author explains how this mechanism is not accompanied by synchronous electrical events in the muscle fiber membrane and how it can provide valuable information for understanding the molecular mechanism of muscular contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
