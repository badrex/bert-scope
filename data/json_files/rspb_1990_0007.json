They suggest that early visual processing involves spatio-temporal Boolean functions summarized in 4x4 look-up tables of 16 templates behind each sensory neuron. This theory can be applied to the design of artificial seeing systems and provides a comprehensive and versatile approach to understanding visual behavior and neural processing.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Vision and Perception"}
