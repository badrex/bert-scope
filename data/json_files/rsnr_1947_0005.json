Dating from the early seventeenth century, the house showcases the Cotswold tradition of masoncraft. The property features original architectural elements, including moulded window jambs, finely wrought chimney stacks, and well-proportioned quoins. The house also contains period fittings, such as doors, cupboards, and stone fireplaces. Some interesting graffiti on the plaster walls may be early evidence of Newton's genius. The National Trust has promised to preserve the recently discovered geometrical drawings in the stonework, which are believed to be the work of a young Newton.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Architectural History"}
