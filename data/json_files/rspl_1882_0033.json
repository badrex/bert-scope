The author found that the specific resistance of glass decreases by half for every 8.5\u00b0C rise in temperature. The study also shows that the electrical resistance of glass is closely related to its density and chemical composition, with high-density glass having a higher electrical resistance. The results provide insights into the relationship between the purity of chemical composition and electrical resistance in glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
