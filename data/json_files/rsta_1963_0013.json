They assume that each point in the mixture is occupied by all constituents in given portions, and the motion of each constituent is governed by the usual equations of motion and continuity. The theory is applied to various steady-state problems involving non-Newtonian fluids and the propagation of plane waves through a homogeneous mixture of viscous fluids at rest.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
