They observed that a particle loses an amount of energy in a branch collision equal to that acquired by the branch electron. The results support the quantum theory formula and show that the effect of atomic binding forces is negligible in these collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle and Nuclear Physics"}
