The open cycle fossil fuel system is explored in detail, focusing on issues such as flow stability, electrode longevity, air preheaters, seed recovery, and the development of superconducting magnets. The article also touches upon alternative MHD generator types, such as closed cycle systems and liquid metal systems, and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy and Power"}
