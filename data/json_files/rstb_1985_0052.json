Researchers found that the receptive field sizes of these neurons were larger in rats treated with capsaicin, and the post-synaptic efficacy of remaining C fibers appeared to be the same as in control rats. These findings suggest that neonatal capsaicin treatment may decrease tonic descending inhibitory influences, leading to changes in pain processing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
