The authors reformulate the basic theory and provide transparent expressions for atomic level shifts, taking into account electrostatic and electromagnetic retardation effects. The study focuses on the symmetry properties of the shifts and explores the role of hydrogenic degeneracies, finding them to be less important in most situations of interest.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
