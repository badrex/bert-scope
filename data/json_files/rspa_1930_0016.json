It presents a formula that determines the velocity of the flame relative to the unburned gas, considering the conductivity, rate of reaction, specific heat, and density. The study also explores the impact of cooling on flame propagation and the existence of a lower and upper limit for the flame's velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas dynamics and combustion"}
