It explores various techniques, such as leaf physiognomy, wood anatomy, and the use of nearest living relatives, to reconstruct the climate of continental interiors during this warmest interval of global climate in the Cenozoic era. The study highlights the limitations of these methods and suggests that models may not fully incorporate the forcing factors present during the Eocene."}
