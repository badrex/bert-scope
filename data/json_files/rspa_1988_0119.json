They found a complete set of normal modes expressed in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics, which exhibit increasing frequency as the horizon is approached. This analysis raises conceptual questions about the stability of space-time solutions and the development of horizons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
