The decomposition produces hydrogen and hydrogen chloride, with no gaseous carbon compounds formed. The remaining carbon and hydrogen are deposited as a graphite-like solid. The reaction is kinetically complex, and the authors propose a chain reaction mechanism. The fully inhibited reaction appears to be a unimolecular process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
