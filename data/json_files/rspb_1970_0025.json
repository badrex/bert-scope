They found that it is possible to differentiate between strains using a combination of four spermatozoan characteristics. The study also demonstrated the usefulness of multivariate analysis in understanding the genetics of spermatozoan dimensions and potential applications in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
