It shows that animals with faster growth rates have more mature skeletons at each age compared to slower-growing animals. However, the growth rate of the skeleton does not keep pace with the rapid increase in body weight, resulting in shorter femora and less calcium content in rapidly growing rats. The research highlights the importance of nutrition in influencing both the rate of growth and ossification of bones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
