It discusses the design of the Pilot ACE, a smaller version of the planned Automatic Computing Engine, and its special features. The study evaluates the impact of optimum coding on the speed and efficiency of the machine, considering the limitations of its facilities and the rudimentary nature of its storage system. The paper concludes by comparing the Pilot ACE's performance with other electronic computers of the time, highlighting the advantages and challenges of its design."}
