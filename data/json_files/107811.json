He discovered that the solar rays have sensible magnetic properties that can be observed in the vibrations of a magnetized needle, independently of the heat they impart. The author also found that an increase in temperature causes a decrease in the intensity of the needle, and that the capacity of brass for developing magnetism by induction is diminished by an increase in temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
