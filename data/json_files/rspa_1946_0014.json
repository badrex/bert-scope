They found that the reaction was predominantly a surface one, influenced by the nature of the containing surfaces. The results support the conclusion that the reaction is heterogeneous, with water vapour slightly retarding the rate of decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
