They discovered four types of tumor growth and found that rats with a higher lymphocyte and plasma-cell content in their spleen were more likely to be immune to the sarcoma. They also found that exposure to radium could make rats immune to the sarcoma cells. This study provided insights into the immune response and potential treatments for cancer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
