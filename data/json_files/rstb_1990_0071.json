It examines long-term acidification, land-use and land-management changes, and the effects of acid deposition on lake ecosystems. The study finds that acid deposition is the main cause of recent lake acidification and that afforestation of sensitive catchments in areas of high sulphur deposition can have a significant effect on lake acidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
