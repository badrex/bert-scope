Hybrid vigour can be achieved through various methods, including the use of inbred lines and cross-pollination. The author highlights the importance of balancing yield, vigour, and uniformity in crop improvement and the potential benefits of using hybrid vigour in plant breeding for better phenotypic stability and performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
