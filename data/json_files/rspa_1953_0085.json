They determined rotational constants for the two combining states and obtained values for the centrifugal stretching constants. The results show a high degree of agreement with other isotopic molecules and provide secondary wavelength standards for the spectral region.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
