They found that the toxin and antitoxin react chemically, and this reaction can be separated using a gelatin filter. This discovery challenges previous theories that the interaction between toxins and antitoxins is indirect and occurs through the intervention of cells in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
