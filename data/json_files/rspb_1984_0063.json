The researchers found that the patterns of isoelectric forms remain unchanged under different light conditions. They also discovered that the differences in isoelectric forms are due to the proteins' quaternary structure and not their amino acid composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis and Plant Physiology"}
