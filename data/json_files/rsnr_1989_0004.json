Crofton", "semantic_tags": ["Structural Engineering", "Mechanics", "Mathematics", "Stiffness", "Statics"], "tldr": "The article discusses an extension of Maxwell's theory of pin-jointed frameworks by M. W. Crofton. It explains the concept of self-strain in frameworks and how certain frameworks can be in a state of stress independently of external forces. The author also provides examples of hexagonal and octagonal frameworks that can be self-strained.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
