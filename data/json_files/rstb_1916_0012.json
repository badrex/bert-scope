They observed the occiput, palate, ethmoidal, and otic regions, and provided insights into the interparietal bone, carotid canal, squamosal, quadrate, quadrato-jugal, and columella auris. The study contributes to the understanding of the Dicynodon skull's morphology and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
