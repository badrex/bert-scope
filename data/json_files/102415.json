He explains how a linen cloth or a thread can be used to form a regular concave surface, which he suspected to be parabolical. He also discusses the potential for creating mutable concave mirrors for various purposes, such as burning glasses, by using clay plates and metal surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
