The results show that the initial rate of absorption depends on the mobility of the cation, while the total amount absorbed is influenced by the position of equilibrium. The study also highlights the differences in absorption rates and the order of absorption for different salts and plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
