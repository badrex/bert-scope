They found that when test tubes were submerged in dichromate solution and exposed to light, the reaction produced abnormal bands of precipitate. The author concluded that the anomaly was caused by light, as normal stratifications were formed when the test tubes were shielded from light.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
