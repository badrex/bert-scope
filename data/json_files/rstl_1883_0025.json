They also discuss various preservation techniques for studying plant cells, finding that a saturated watery solution of picric acid provides the best results. This research supports the idea that plant cells are fundamentally a protoplasmic body connected by these threads.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
