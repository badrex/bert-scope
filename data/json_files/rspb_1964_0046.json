The research shows that newly emerged adult locusts discharge carbon dioxide periodically to conserve water, while once they start feeding, they discharge it continuously. The carbon dioxide output is linked to weight gain, color change, sexual maturation, and migration. As locusts approach senescence, their fat reserves rapidly decrease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
