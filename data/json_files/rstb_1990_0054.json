It explores the signaling pathways involved in cell proliferation and the effects of growth factors on these processes. The study highlights the importance of inositol lipid hydrolysis in the stimulation of quiescent cells and the involvement of tyrosine kinase oncogenes in these pathways.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
