They determined the frequencies of the normal modes of vibration and used rigid ion models and shell models to analyze the interatomic forces. The results showed that anharmonic interactions in lead telluride are significantly more than in simple alkali halides. The authors also discussed the effects of doping on lattice vibrations and provided calculations for different dopant concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
