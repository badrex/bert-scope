The organ is described as primarily glandular and plays a role in defense against injury and invading organisms. The study investigates the various structures and functions of the organ, including the presence of pigments, secretions, and the role of amoebocytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
