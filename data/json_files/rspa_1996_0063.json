The model allows for the study of both equilibrium and non-equilibrium phase behavior and can be used to investigate the evolution of binary and ternary systems. This approach offers a more unified and dynamic understanding of microemulsion systems compared to previous models.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
