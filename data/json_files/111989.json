Hofmann, describes the transformation of aniline-red into aniline-blue, a significant discovery in the field of coal-tar colorants. He explains the chemical processes involved in this transformation, including the reaction between rosaniline and aniline, and the role of organic acids in the process. Hofmann also discusses the properties and applications of aniline-blue, as well as its relation to other colorants and chemical compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
