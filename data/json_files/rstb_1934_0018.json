The authors found that factors such as temperature and humidity significantly impact the adult life, reproduction, and puparial stage of the flies. These findings can help improve our understanding of these insects and contribute to the development of better control methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Population Biology"}
