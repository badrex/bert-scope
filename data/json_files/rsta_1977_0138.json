The primary reinforcing members do not fracture, providing a residual fail-safe characteristic and inhibiting crack growth in the metal sheet through strain energy reduction and frictional energy losses. This damage-tolerant composite system has potential applications in engineering and structural components.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
