He explains that the rhythmic action is not dependent on the heart's nervous centers or the blood flowing through its cavities. Instead, it is something within the heart itself. Paget also describes various experiments that demonstrate the source of the rhythmic action and how it is not solely due to the properties of the muscular tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
