The research found that 25 species of bats, including pteropodids and microchiropterans, have recolonized the islands. Pteropodids were the first bat colonists of the Krakatau archipelago, while microchiropterans arrived more recently. The study highlights the importance of bat movements between the islands and the mainland in the reestablishment of vegetation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
