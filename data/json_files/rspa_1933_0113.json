The authors discuss the allowed levels in the crystal lattice and how the periodic potential determines the energies of both characteristic and irregular levels. They also explain the role of submicroscopic cracks and the introduction of electrons and positive charges in the coloration of crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
