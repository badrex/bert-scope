They observed marked absorption in all satellites of the 5461 A group, except one, and reversed five of them. The results indicate that the average absorption of satellites is much smaller compared to the main line, and strong absorption of satellites is only visible under specific conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
