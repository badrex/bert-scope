The Large T protein, encoded by SV40 virus, interacts with cellular DNA and influences cellular DNA synthesis and transcription. It also forms a complex with the host-coded p53 protein, which may play a crucial role in the oncogenic action of the protein. The study aims to understand the interaction between Large T and p53, as well as the cellular targets of Large T in transformed cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
