The author explains how coal-dust, combined with air and fire-damp, can become inflammable and cause explosions in dry coal mines. The author also discusses the importance of mine ventilation and the impact of temperature on the wetness or dryness of coal mines.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mining and Mineral Resources"}
