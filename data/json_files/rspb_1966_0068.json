The research shows that the ratio of sodium to potassium in saliva tends to rise initially and then fall with continued residence at high altitudes. The urinary aldosterone levels are also found to be very low, but they gradually recover over weeks. These findings suggest that changes in intravascular volume, likely intrathoracic, occur upon ascent to a low-pressure environment, affecting electrolyte regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
