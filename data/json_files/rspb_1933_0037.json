They discover that xanthine oxidase inhibits the activity of glucose dehydrogenase by destroying it. This inhibition can be prevented by using a phosphate buffer, suggesting that the phosphate ions protect the glucose dehydrogenase enzyme from being destroyed by xanthine oxidase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Enzyme Mechanisms"}
