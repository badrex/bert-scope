The instrument consists of a tube with two balls, one containing water to be frozen and the other a vacuum. When the empty ball is placed in a freezing mixture, the water in the other ball freezes within a few minutes. This method demonstrates the transfer of heat and the generation of cold at a distance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
