They found that three tested fluids displayed non-Newtonian behavior and appeared to approach a limiting shear stress with increasing shear rate. The results suggest that fluids reach a point where they cannot sustain an equivalent increase in shear stress, indicating a potential limiting value of 0.1 Pa for shear stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
