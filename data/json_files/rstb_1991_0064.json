It examines the effects of plant density, growth surface analysis, and diffusion of properties across growth phase boundaries. The study provides a unified non-dimensional formula for normal natural growth, growth with plastic deformation, and growth subject to the self-thinning process. The findings explain features of the self-thinning process and the constants and parameters associated with power law descriptions of phase boundaries. The article also offers a preliminary classification of geometric forms and formulae for evaluating quantities for various cases of interest in plant growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
