It shows that the mechanisms for activating \u03b1- and \u03b2-globin genes during erythroid cell differentiation are fundamentally different. The study suggests that the sequences responsible for these differences are located within the structural genes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
