Three classes of nerve cells are distinguished: perpendicular (class I), tangential (class II), and amacrine cells (class III). The research describes the connections and functions of these cells in the optic lobes, providing insights into the visual system of insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
