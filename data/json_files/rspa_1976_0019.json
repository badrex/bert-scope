They confirmed the presence of a shallow absorption minimum around 60 \u00c5 and found that the absorption profile between 40 and 75 \u00c5 is in better agreement with the independent particle model than previously reported. A broad absorption maximum between 20 and 50 \u00c5 is also detected, which is compared with the predictions of the independent particle model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
