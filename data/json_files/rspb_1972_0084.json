The research focuses on the translation, rotation, and deformation of red blood cells and rouleaux in plasma, revealing that deformation occurs over a wide range of shear rates due to the flexibility of the particles. The findings contribute to the understanding of blood flow mechanics and the overall mechanics of flow in blood vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
