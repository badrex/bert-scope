He observed that the plant lost weight over time, but the number of leaves remained constant. He concluded that the roots supply nourishment to create new leaves, suggesting that sap circulates within the plant. This research contributes to our understanding of plant growth and nutrition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
