(1995). They propose that these interactions can be explained by the correlated expression of neuronal transients following or preceding a salient event. This alternative perspective allows for models of neural coding to be reinstated and suggests a powerful analysis based on singular value decomposition of firing rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Temporal Coding"}
