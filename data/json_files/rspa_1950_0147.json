They found that this phenomenon can be explained by an asymmetric fission process and the influence of specific long-range nuclear forces. The mass of the emitted fragment does not depend on the size of the star, and the energy distribution of the fragments is different from that of evaporation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
