It explores the energy spectra and emission mechanisms of these sources, focusing on thermal bremsstrahlung and the synchrotron process. The article also examines the variability, distance, and radio emissions of specific X-ray sources like Sco X-1 and Cen X-2.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
