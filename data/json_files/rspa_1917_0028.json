They discovered that the spacing of the 001 planes in both crystals is half of what is expected from their crystal data. The crystal structure of rutile and cassiterite is built on a different scale, with cassiterite having a greater atomic density than rutile. The authors propose a model that explains the results and discusses the symmetry and arrangement of the atoms in the crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
