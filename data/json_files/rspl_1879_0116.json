They found that phosphoric acid weakens the intensity of the potassium spectrum, making it difficult to accurately estimate the concentration of potassium in a solution. This has implications for understanding the chemical composition of the brain and its inorganic components.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
