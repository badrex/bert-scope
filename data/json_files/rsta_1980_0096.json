The author analyzes the thermodynamics of a separating interface, including the effects of multicomponent adsorption, and provides experimental data for polycrystalline iron with dilute concentrations of phosphorus. The results show that the work for slow separation is naturally less than that for fast separation, and the model accounts for diverse possibilities in the process of separation."}
