They introduce the concept of segregates and congregates, and establish a theorem that every congregate can be expressed as a linear function of the segregates of the same deg-order. The memoir also explores the use of these functions in understanding the properties of covariants in various mathematical scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
