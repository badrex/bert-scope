The author examines different formulas and their constants, comparing their accuracy and suitability for representing observed wave-lengths. The article also considers the impact of line structure on the value of the constant and the implications of different assumptions about the nature of the lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
