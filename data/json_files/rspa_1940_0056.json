The authors investigate the critical pressure and temperature conditions for the explosive reaction, and analyze the influence of gases like hydrogen and helium on the critical pressure. The results show that the increased conductivity caused by these gases does not lead to a corresponding increase in critical pressure, which may be due to inefficient energy transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
