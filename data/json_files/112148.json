W. Binney, describes fossil plants found in the lower coal-seams of Lancashire and Yorkshire. He discusses the challenges of studying these plants due to their fragmentary and distorted conditions. Binney examines the internal and external structures of various specimens, including Sigillaria and Diploxylon, and provides evidence of their relationships to other plants like Lepidodendron. The fossils were found in calcareous nodules within coal seams, contributing to our understanding of the Carboniferous period's fossil flora.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
