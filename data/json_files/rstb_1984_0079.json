They found that representatives of all three suborders and eight families of the order Strongylida possessed an endotube, while only one genus, Strongyloides, had this structure in the four other parasitic orders and the one free-living group. The endotube's thickness ranged from 80 nm to 6 \u00b5m, and its presence and structure provided insights into the organization and function of nematode intestines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
