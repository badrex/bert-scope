They discuss how variations in sedimentation rates can lead to different diagenetic mineral assemblages and how these changes can be influenced by factors such as climate and tectonic environment. The study provides insights into understanding the record of climate change and the effects of external processes on diagenetic alteration in sedimentary basins.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Sedimentology"}
