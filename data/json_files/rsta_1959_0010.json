They identify two distinct components: an annual component with a summer maximum and winter minimum, and a semi-annual component with equinoxial maxima. The study concludes that the annual component is likely caused by an atmospheric dynamo effect, while the semi-annual component arises from a systematic annual variation of the angle between the Earth's magnetic axis and the sun-earth line.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geomagnetism"}
