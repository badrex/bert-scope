The researchers found that under physiological ionic gradients, intracellular ATP inhibits channel activity, but this sensitivity is modulated by extracellular cations. In contrast, ATP-K+ channels from an insulin-secreting cell line (CRI-G1) were not affected by extracellular cations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
