The author analyzes the results and compares the oscillation amplitudes, finding differences in accordance with the opposing forces of Earth's magnetism at the two stations. The study also highlights the similarities and differences in the zero-point phases at various locations, such as Pekin, the Cape of Good Hope, and St. Helena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
