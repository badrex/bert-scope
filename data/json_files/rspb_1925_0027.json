They found that enforced air-breathing caused a pseudo-metamorphosis in the Axolotl, where the fin fuses with the skin. The author also observed that metamorphosis induced by air-breathing is reversible, while thyroid and pituitary secretions are needed for complete metamorphosis. Lastly, the author experimented with precocious metamorphosis using thyroid and urethane, a general anaesthetic, on tadpoles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
