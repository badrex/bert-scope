The author discusses the changes made to the experimental setup and the methods used to obtain accurate measurements. The study found that potential gradient is a highly variable element, with a well-marked minimum near midsummer and a possible second minimum in January. The author also discusses the influence of fog and the potential relationship between electric potential gradient and the sunspot cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
