He describes their movement, reproduction, and behavior, and even observes a smaller organism entering the animalculum, potentially causing its death. Van Leeuwenhoek also speculates that these creatures may have air in their bodies, which could help them control their buoyancy in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
