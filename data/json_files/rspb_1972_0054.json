Factors like tree age, position in a stand, and competition for light and water play a role in resistance. Trees have defense mechanisms like producing resin, forming new roots, and creating barriers with bark. Understanding these resistance mechanisms can help in managing and preventing tree diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
