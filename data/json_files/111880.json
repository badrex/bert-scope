Ellis, extends and corrects Pliicker's theory of transversals in algebraic geometry. He introduces the concept of scalar and clinant radical loci and demonstrates how to represent algebraic formations geometrically. The study concludes with an application of the theory to a simple case with clinant roots.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
