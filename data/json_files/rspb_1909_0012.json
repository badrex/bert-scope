The authors propose a hypothesis that cholesterol is a constant constituent of cells and is utilized in the formation of new cells. The liver breaks down dead cells and eliminates their cholesterol in the bile, which is then reabsorbed in the intestine and carried by the blood to be reincorporated into new cells. The authors also discuss the possibility of cholesterol being synthesized by the animal or taken up from the food to replace any wastage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
