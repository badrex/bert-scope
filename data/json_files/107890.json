Brewster's experiments demonstrate how the angle of incidence and the angle of refraction affect the polarization of light. He also discusses the application of this law to various materials and the phenomenon of polarization in different colors of light. The findings provide a better understanding of the behavior of light and its polarization in different scenarios.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
