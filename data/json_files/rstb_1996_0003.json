They found that the shells had a complex biomineral structure with fluorapatite francolite, which was secreted in stratiform laminations. The study revealed that the degradation of organic material during fossilization was not uniform, and the shells' chemico-structural changes played a significant role in their preservation. This research provides insights into the factors affecting the fossilization process and the evolution of lingulid shells.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Paleontology"}
