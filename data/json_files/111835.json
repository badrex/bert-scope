The author introduces the concepts of strain and stress, and explains how they can be resolved into elementary strains and stresses. The author also investigates the potential energy of elasticity and the coefficients of elasticity, and applies the principles of the Calculus of Forms to the orthogonal transformations of these coefficients. The article concludes with observations on the differences between the laws of solid elasticity and those of luminiferous force, and on the refraction of light in crystals in relation to the symmetry of their elastic axes."}
