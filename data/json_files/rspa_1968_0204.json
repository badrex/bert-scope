Hoyle reviews recent developments in cosmology, focusing on the big bang and steady-state theories. He discusses the importance of symmetry postulates, homogeneity, and isotropy in understanding the expansion and contraction of the universe. Hoyle also examines the red-shift-distance relationship, the origin of chemical elements, and the Stebbins-Whitford effect, which were significant challenges to the steady-state theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
