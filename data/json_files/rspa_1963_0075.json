They observed two strong absorption bands at 7000 and 5000 \u00c5 and found that the absorption bands are associated with bulk properties. The transmission of light begins to oscillate as the crystal thickness decreases, and thicker crystals may transmit more light than thinner ones. The authors also detected a response at both absorption edges and observed photoconduction peaks at the wavelengths of the exciton bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
