It explores the potential effects of climate change on regional climates and the physiological processes within trees, as well as the challenges in predicting and managing these changes. The authors emphasize the need for further research to better understand the complex interactions between forests, weather, and climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
