They discovered that when heated with water, narcotine splits into meconin and cotarnine. This reaction may explain the presence of meconin in opium and opium residues. The authors also studied the effects of various reagents and conditions on the decomposition of narcotine, such as the action of heat, water, and ferric chloride.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alkaloids"}
