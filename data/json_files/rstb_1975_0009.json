The authors argue that any model of motivational processes can be represented by isoclines in a causal-factor space, which join points with the same degree of competitiveness for behavioral expression. They outline an empirical method for determining motivational states and discuss its implications for motivation theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Motivation and Emotion"}
