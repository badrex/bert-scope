They show that uniform rearrangements, which involve dividing, translating, and reassembling a crystal, can be used to understand the relationship between plasticity theory and crystal defects. This work provides a rigorous connection between the kinematics of plasticity and the theory of continuous distributions of dislocations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
