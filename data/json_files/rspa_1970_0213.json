The author studies a set of four null vectors and expands the metric tensor, rotation coefficients, and tetrad components of the Riemann tensor in inverse powers of r. The paper derives the field equations in two successive approximations and examines their effect on the total energy and linear momentum. The author also presents a criterion for recognizing certain classes of non-radiating fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
