They found that silkworms developed at a similar rate in both light and dark conditions, with no significant differences in size, color, or metamorphosis. This suggests that light may not play a crucial role in the development and growth of silkworms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
