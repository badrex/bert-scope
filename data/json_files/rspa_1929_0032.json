The authors develop a new method to estimate the average probability of excitation, taking into account the effects of inelastic collisions and ionization. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of the distribution of energies in electron streams and the role of atomic properties in determining the probability of excitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
