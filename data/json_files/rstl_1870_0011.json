By comparing the Earth-current photograms with magnetometer curves, the author finds a causal connection between the galvanic currents and magnetic disturbances, providing a more accurate scale for converting indications into magnetic force. This research contributes to understanding the underlying mechanisms of Earth's magnetic field and its relation to galvanic currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
