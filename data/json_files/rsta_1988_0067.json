The authors propose an inhomogeneous accretion model for the Earth, involving two components with different chemical compositions. They also analyze the composition of Mars, using SNC meteorites as evidence for its bulk composition. The study highlights the differences in accretion history and composition between the Earth and Mars, providing insights into the formation of these planets.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
