These benthic siphonophores have a short stem, a spherical cormidium, and a corona of nectophores surrounding a large pneumatophore. They possess a dorsal aurophore, which contains an expanded pneumatochone for gas secretion. The article discusses their history, systematics, and the adaptations that have allowed them to thrive in their benthic habitat, such as buoyancy control and feeding methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Invertebrates"}
