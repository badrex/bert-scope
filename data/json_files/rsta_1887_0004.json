This method is based on reasoning from the fundamental concepts of the calculus of variations and can be applied to any integral. The author also discusses the limitations of previous methods and the importance of understanding the interdependence of variables in solving these problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus of Variations"}
