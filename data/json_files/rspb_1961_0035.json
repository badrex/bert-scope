The research found that exposure to radiation reduces the median age and increases the standard deviation of the distribution of ages at death. The life-shortening effect was found to be proportional to the dose, with no threshold, and the survival curves were parallel, suggesting that exposure ages the animal by removing weeks from its early life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Aging and Gerontology"}
