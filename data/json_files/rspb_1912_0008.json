They found that the substances produced by the bacteria were the same for both sugars, including acetic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, formic acid, ethyl alcohol, carbon dioxide, and hydrogen. The authors also discovered that the ratio of hydrogen to carbon dioxide in the gas evolved from glucose by B. cloacae was smaller than in the case of B. lactis aerogenes. Additionally, they identified butylene glycol as one of the products of fermentation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
