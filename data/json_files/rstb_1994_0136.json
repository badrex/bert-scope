Although there are some similarities between language acquisition and dissolution, there are also important differences. The author suggests focusing on general principles that constrain the acquisition and dissolution of language, rather than just the behavioral similarities. The author also explores category-specific deficits in language, such as semantic category-specific disorders, and their implications for understanding the organization of lexical knowledge.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
