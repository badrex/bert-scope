The authors test the Bailey-Orowan equation, which states that strain hardening must be balanced by recovery to maintain a constant mechanical state. The experiments show that the equation is accurate, provided that the strain hardening coefficient is measured on creep-tested specimens. The research also explores the stress sensitivity of creep rate and the influence of stress on strain hardening and recovery rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties of Materials"}
