The experiment shows that pigeons confined with a mirror or a single companion lay eggs after a longer interval than those with direct access to a mate. The results suggest that the stimulus causing ovulation in pigeons is primarily visual. This research supports the idea that sexual display in birds is a mutual pituitary stimulation rather than a conscious sexual selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
