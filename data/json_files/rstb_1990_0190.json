It shows how the geometry of population growth rates can oppose or promote competitive exclusion depending on the shapes of growth rates. Heterogeneity within a single species population plays a crucial role in the outcome of interactions with other species. The study provides insights into understanding the complex dynamics of ecological communities and the role of environmental variability in maintaining species' diversities."}
