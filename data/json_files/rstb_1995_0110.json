It explains how principles from prokaryotes apply to eukaryotes and how control elements could have been combined during evolution. The article also highlights the understanding of development in Drosophila, which can be described as a series of genetic switches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Genetics"}
