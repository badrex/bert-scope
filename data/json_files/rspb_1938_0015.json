They found that a significant proportion of two-year-old parr were males with functional sperm, indicating that the male phase is normal and functional in freshwater salmon before they migrate to the sea. The female parr remain immature in the parr stage, and the authors suggest that further research on sex-condition changes during and after the spawning season could provide valuable insights into salmon reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
