The research uses palaeolimnological techniques and water quality measurements to assess the effects of atmospheric pollution, catchment management, and liming on the lakes' water chemistry and diatom communities. The findings show that the lakes have experienced improvements in water quality due to reduced acidity and atmospheric contamination, but the ecological response to these changes is still small."}
