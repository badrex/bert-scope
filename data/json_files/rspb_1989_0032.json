They describe how techniques such as cloning and analyzing DNA segments helped identify the dystrophin gene, which is responsible for the disorder. This discovery has led to improved diagnosis and potential therapeutic approaches for muscular dystrophy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
