They examine the condition of the ovum before and after impregnation and conduct experiments to determine the role of spermatozoa and the fluid portion of semen in impregnation. The author concludes that spermatozoa are the sole agents in impregnating the ovum, while the fluid portion of the semen is not essential for the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
