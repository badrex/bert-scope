The author examines the crystallography, symmetry, and space group of the hemihydrate, concluding that it has a hexagonal unit cell. The study also explores the dehydration process of hemihydrate into soluble anhydrite and its rehydration properties. The findings provide insights into the micro-porosity and adsorption equilibria of hemihydrate with water vapor.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
