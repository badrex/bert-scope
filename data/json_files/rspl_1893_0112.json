The meteoric stone was analyzed, revealing strong reactions for nickel, confirming its meteoric origin. In the plant study, the author discusses the formation of root hairs, the development of cork, and the dorsi-ventral structure of climbing roots in pitcher plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Meteoritics"}
