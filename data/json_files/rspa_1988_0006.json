The major paramagnetic species in these solutions are solvated electrons and electron-cation complexes, while the diamagnetic species is the alkali-metal anion. The results provide insights into the properties of these solutions and their potential applications as selective two-electron reducing agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
