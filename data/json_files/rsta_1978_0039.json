It explores the role of plate tectonics and the influence of mantle melting on the formation of the Earth's continental crust. The authors argue that the majority of modern granites are found in Cordilleran settings, and that the balance between marginal heat focusing and intracontinental granite generation has shifted over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Plate Tectonics"}
