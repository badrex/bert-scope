It demonstrates that classical mechanics can provide a valid guide to understanding these effects, which depend crucially on the dimensionality of the system. The study focuses on potentials that are finite at the origin and discusses the square-well and exponential potentials as examples.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
