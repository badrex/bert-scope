They find a characteristic absorption between the solar lines F and M in all chlorophyll derivatives, confirming the relationship between chlorophyll and haemoglobin, the two main coloring matters in the plant and animal kingdoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
