It highlights the importance of amateur and professional observations in detecting TLP and the challenges in distinguishing genuine lunar events from spurious effects. The article also explores the distribution of TLP-prone areas, the correlation with mare boundaries and rille areas, and the attempts to link TLP with solar activity and lunar perigee and apogee.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Lunar Geology"}
