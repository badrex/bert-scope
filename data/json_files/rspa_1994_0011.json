They find that when the Green's function of the unribbed structure is only composed of its subsonic surface wave component, the response of the structure is exponentially localized, a phenomenon known as Anderson localization. The localization length is calculated, and it is found to agree well with numerical simulations. However, when a weak acoustic component is included in the Green's function, the exponential localization is short-circuited, and the response decays algebraically with distance from the first rib, showing negligible sensitivity to disorder.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
