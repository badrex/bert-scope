The authors propose a modified version of the die-swell problem that is easier to set up experimentally and is well-posed mathematically. They discuss the theoretical ideas behind this approach and describe some experiments comparing the flow of Newtonian and non-Newtonian fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
