It presents a mathematical model that accounts for the effects of parasitism on ruminant feeding rate and productivity, and compares the results with field observations. The study highlights the importance of understanding the population biology of plant-herbivore and host-parasite interactions to improve grazing system management and reduce production losses due to parasitic gastroenteritis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
