The second comet had a diameter nearly one-third that of Earth and appeared to be closer to a planetary condition. The light from this comet was considered to be reflected from the Sun, while the first comet's light was phosphorescent. The author also discussed the composition of the comet's chevelure, which he believed consisted of phosphoric matter suspended in an elastic atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comets"}
