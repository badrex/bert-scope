Two types of surface irregularities are considered: indentation and discontinuity in mass-loading. The incident SH-wave can be either a bulk wave or a surface wave. The study leads to integral equations and numerical results for various configurations, including triangularly prismatic indentation, rigid strip loading, and traction-free interruption in mass-loading.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
