They found that the serum obtained from the immunized goats had significant anti-endotoxic, agglutinative, and bacteriolytic properties, which could neutralize multiple lethal doses of the typhoid endotoxin. The serum was also tested for its specificity against the cholera endotoxin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
