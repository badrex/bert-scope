They found that certain transduced chorion DNA sequences initiated a pattern of tissue-specific differential replication similar to normal chorion amplification. This suggests that differential chorion DNA replication is mediated by specific origin-containing sequences located near the center of the amplified domains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
