The researchers found that motoneurons had varying sensitivities to L-glutamate, with no significant differences between soma and processes. This technique provides a valuable tool for neuropharmacological studies in the spinal cord.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
