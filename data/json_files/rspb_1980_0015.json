The model suggests that veins develop as channels within a flow pattern, with the capacity of a strand of cells to transport a signal increasing with the flux of the signal it carries. This can generate open, branching vein systems and simulate vein formation experiments. The model also accounts for the formation of complex vein networks, including branches and loops, by considering the distribution of source activity in growing leaves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
