They found that the formation of CH3D from n-butane and butene-1 is not significantly affected by the addition of nitric oxide. The exchange between methane and deuterium is much greater than the decomposition of methane, with the ratio being about fifteen times. This suggests that the residual reaction is an independent molecular transformation rather than a chain reaction involving alkyl radicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
