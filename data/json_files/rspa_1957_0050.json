The method is applied to various examples, including plasma oscillations of an electron gas, nuclear structure models, and meson-nucleon interaction problems. The author proposes a formula for the moment of inertia of a rotating system and explains how to determine the parameters of collective motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
