They analyze the first, second, and third-order powers of tests and the expected size of interval estimators, both conditional and unconditional. The study also explores the characteristics of conditional inference and the role of ancillary statistics and curvatures in the process. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the geometrical approach to statistical inference.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
