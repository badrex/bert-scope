They discovered that insulin promotes the storage of glucose as glycogen in muscles and that a significant portion of glucose is oxidized in the liver. The study also revealed that previous calculations of glucose loss may have been underestimated, leading to a better understanding of insulin's role in glucose metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
