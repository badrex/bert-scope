They found that the damage is highly dependent on the thickness of the crystal, with tracks visible in thin crystals and dislocation loops in thicker ones. The authors also discussed the possible mechanisms of energy loss and the mobility of point defects created by fission fragments in the crystal lattice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
