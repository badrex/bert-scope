Hypothyroidism induced by various methods significantly increased the electrogenic valine transfer, while thyroid hormone treatment reduced the elevated values. The results suggest that electrogenic valine transfer is a more sensitive index of change in thyroid status than the conventional measure of total body oxygen uptake.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
