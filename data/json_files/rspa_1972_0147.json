They apply the Born stability criteria to these crystals and find that they become unstable before reaching the maximum ideal stress-strain curve. This leads to a reduction in previous estimates of the ideal tensile strength. The study provides insights into the mechanical properties of perfect crystals and their behavior under stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
