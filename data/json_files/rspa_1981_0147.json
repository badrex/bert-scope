They demonstrate that all states of steady flow are stationary states of an energy functional, which can be minimized to determine stability. This work generalizes Rayleigh's energy principle to include non-axially symmetric systems and perturbations, while still considering barotropic fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
