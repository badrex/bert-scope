They used a leaf of Elodea and a sciatic nerve of Nupharia to compare the results. The study found that chloroform had the most significant impact on the protoplasm, causing a complete arrest of movement. Ether and carbon dioxide also affected the protoplasm, but to a lesser extent. The authors concluded that the observed phenomena were due to the temporary or permanent paralysis of the protoplasm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
