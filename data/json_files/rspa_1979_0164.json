The model used is similar to the one in Part I but with the introduction of anisotropic optical properties associated with the chain links. Equations are derived for the differences of principal polarizabilities for the biaxially strained network, which are then evaluated by numerical computation. The variations of polarizability differences with strain follow a pattern similar to the corresponding principal stresses, and the theory predicts an important effect not derivable from simpler theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
