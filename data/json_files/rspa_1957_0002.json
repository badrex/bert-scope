They also examined related crystal forms from other species and observed minor differences in amino-acid composition, but the overall structure remained consistent. This research contributes to understanding the structure and properties of myoglobin, a protein essential for oxygen transport in muscle tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
