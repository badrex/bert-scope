They find that these cells are derived from undifferentiated cells and play a crucial role in the formation of the testicular tubules. The authors also draw a parallel between the development of the mammalian testis and that of the amphibian testis, highlighting the similarities in the process. This research contributes to our understanding of the reproductive system and cell biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
