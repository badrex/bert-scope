They found that the empirical logarithmic law is an adequate approximation for a limited concentration range, and proposed a nonlinear regression method to obtain infinite dilution resonance frequencies. The results provide substantial confirmation of the H.R.S. theory, showing that the bulk dielectric constant of the solvent is a good parameter in the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
