Lavoisier replaced the concept of phlogiston with a combination of caloric, the matter of heat, and oxygen, which he tracked through combustion and calcination reactions. His new ideas led to a reorganization of chemical nomenclature and the publication of his influential work, the Elements of Chemistry. Lavoisier's career as a scientist and administrator was deeply intertwined with the political and social changes of the French Revolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Revolution"}
