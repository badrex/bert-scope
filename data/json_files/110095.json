This action influences the polarity of the iron and affects the directive power of a compass. The author conducted numerous experiments and established a general law for the deviation due to rotation in a dipping-needle. He also proposed a theoretical investigation of the effect of a plate of soft iron with two poles developed in given positions, acting on a needle in the plane of the plate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
