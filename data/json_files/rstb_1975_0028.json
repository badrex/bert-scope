The results show that sodium and potassium ions affect the membrane's permeability and rectification properties. The findings contribute to the understanding of the mechanisms behind excitable membranes and could have implications for developing better models of membrane permeability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
