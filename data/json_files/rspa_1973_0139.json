The author examines the behavior of total and elastic cross-sections, the role of analyticity in energy, and the Pomeranchuk theorem. The findings suggest that the total cross-sections increase with energy, leading to predictions about the behavior of elastic scattering and the real part of the scattering amplitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
