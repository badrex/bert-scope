The authors propose a new procedure for obtaining restrictions on constitutive equations and provide a mathematical statement of the second law. They also discuss the nature of thermodynamic restrictions on thermo-mechanical behavior of single-phase continua, including elastic materials, viscous fluids, and materials with fading memory. This new approach offers a different perspective on thermodynamics, excluding generalized kinematics and forces, and provides a foundation for further research in the field."}
