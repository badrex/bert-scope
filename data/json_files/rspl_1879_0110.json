They found that the heart, like arteries, has tonicity, which plays a significant role in determining the features of the cardiac beat. The author also discovered that alkaline solutions increase the tonicity of artery muscles, while acid solutions decrease it. This research contributes to our understanding of heart and artery function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
