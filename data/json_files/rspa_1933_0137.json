They studied the Raman spectra of various substances, including nitrogen tetroxide, ozone, ice, methane, ammonia, carbon tetrachloride, and liquid air. The results showed that the Raman spectra at low temperatures can be a fruitful field of research, providing insights into molecular structures and vibrational energy levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
