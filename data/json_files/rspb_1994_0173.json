They discovered that dynamic cues, specifically gender-specific lateral body sway, play a significant role in gender identification. This dynamic cue is more dominant than structural cues based on torso shape, even when the cues are set in opposition. The findings suggest that gender-specific differences in the velocity of shoulder and hip dots, rather than positional differences, contribute to gender identification in biological motion displays.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
