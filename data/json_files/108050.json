They collected and analyzed the gas from the King's Bath, finding that the average amount of gas evolved was 264 cubic inches per minute. The author also discussed the historical evidence of similar gas evolution in thermal springs and the potential connection between the evolution of gas and the presence of certain saline ingredients and temperature in the water.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geothermal Energy"}
