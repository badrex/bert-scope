The author, Thomas Hyde Page, explains the unsuccessful attempts to obtain water on-site and proposes a solution for constructing wells that can withstand the filtration of saltwater. The article provides a detailed account of the well construction process in Fort Townshend, Sheerness, which involved the use of wooden frames to support the excavation and prevent the collapse of the well.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Civil Engineering"}
