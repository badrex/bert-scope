They find that under certain conditions, the coexistence of relaxation and diffusion can enhance dispersive waves, leading to the formation of solitary waves. This phenomenon is demonstrated through asymptotic analysis and numerical simulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
