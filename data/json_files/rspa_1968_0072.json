The authors found that the relaxation spectrum cannot be solely interpreted in terms of hydrocarbon type analysis, indicating that other unknown characteristics have a significant influence. A new mechanical model for viscoelasticity is proposed, which fits the experimental results for the oils and their fractions over a wide range of frequencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Rheology"}
