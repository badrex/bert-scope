The authors review the fracture mechanics approaches used to ensure that stress crack growth from the severest defects will not occur or will be limited to insignificant growth during the design life of the system. They also examine the effects of bending and other factors on stress intensity and provide guidelines for safe system design and operation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
