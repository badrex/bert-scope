The researchers observed lymphocytes in close relation to the sinusoidal endothelium and found evidence of lymphocytes passing through the sinusoidal walls. This suggests that there is some interchange of lymphocytes between the bone marrow and blood, which is important for understanding the identity and function of lymphocytes in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
