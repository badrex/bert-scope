The bones were found embedded in a type of rock called allum-rock, which is worn away by the sea and the washing of stones, sand, and other materials. The location of the bones suggests that the alligator lived and died near the coast. The bones were sent to John Fothergill, M.D., who presented them to the Royal Society. This discovery provided valuable information about the prehistoric creatures that once lived in the area.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
