The homogeneous reaction is a polymerization process that is second-order, while the surface reaction is first-order with respect to the acetylene concentration in the gas phase. Both reactions are inhibited by nitric oxide, indicating that they involve radical processes. The authors propose a radical chain mechanism for the formation of polymer and hydrogen, and suggest that the surface reaction is terminated in the gas phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
