J. Russell. The author finds that dust-free layers of air protect surfaces from dust deposition, while deposition occurs where air currents are disrupted or slowed down. This study contributes to understanding the behavior of air currents and dust deposition in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
