They found that certain cell types, such as 'prolactin' cells, were present in the transplants and played a role in maintaining the survival of the grafted-hypophysectomized fish. The study also revealed that the grafts varied in size and cellular composition, and the authors identified various cell types in the transplants, which helped in understanding their function and structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrine System"}
