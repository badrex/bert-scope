He developed a chemical theory of catalysis, which involved the formation of temporary unstable chemical compounds as intermediary steps in reactions. Sabatier's work on catalytic hydrogenation and his discovery of the specificity and selectivity of catalysts laid the foundation for modern catalytic chemistry. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1912 for his work on catalysis."}
