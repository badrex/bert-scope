They found that negative ions, such as CO- and C3H-, were produced when metal surfaces were bombarded with mercury positive ions. The experiments provided insights into the process of \"sputtering\" and the energy distribution of negative ions. This work contributed to the understanding of ion formation and plasma physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
