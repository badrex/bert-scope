They find that molecules with vibrational energy up to the third quantum level play a role in absorption. The study provides insights into the potential energy curves and eigenfunction levels of these molecules, leading to a better understanding of their properties and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
