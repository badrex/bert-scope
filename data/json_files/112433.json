The author demonstrates this through various experiments, including the formation of rouleaux and the behavior of bubbles and vesicles in liquid. This research provides insight into the underlying causes of various phenomena related to blood-corpuscles and their role in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
