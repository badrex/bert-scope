It found that zinc depresses the GABA-evoked conductance increase by possibly binding to an imidazole group. Other transition metal divalent cations were inactive in antagonizing GABA responses. The results suggest that the zinc binding site in lobster muscle may be an important modulatory site for the GABA-evoked chloride conductance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
