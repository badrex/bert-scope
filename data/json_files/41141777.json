They used a pendulum, clock, and telescope to observe the coincidences and took into account the temperature and other factors that could affect the results. The experiments required a high level of care and cooperation, and the author acknowledges the support of the Commander of the Expedition. The results showed that the Earth's ellipticity was approximately 1/289."}
