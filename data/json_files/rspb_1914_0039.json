They found that the development of this strain is similar to the one causing disease in man in Nyasaland, suggesting their identity. The cycle of development takes place in the fly's intestine and eventually reaches the salivary glands, where the infective stage is reached. The study provides valuable insights into the biology and transmission of the disease-causing trypanosome.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
