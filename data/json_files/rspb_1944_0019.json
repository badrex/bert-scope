The researchers found that toads can recognize stationary objects and even differentiate between their parts. They also discovered that toads have a kinematoscopic sensation of movement, which elicits a snapping reflex and a tongue-flicking reaction. This research contributes to our understanding of how animals perceive and respond to visual stimuli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
