The authors determine the fluid's potential and stream function, as well as the energy and forces exerted by the liquid on the cylinder. They use the Lagrange-Kirchhoff method and Blasius contour integral expressions to calculate these forces, considering the effect of variable circulation. The discussion of surfaces of discontinuity is postponed for a future note.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
