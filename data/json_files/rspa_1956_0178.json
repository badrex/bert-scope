They found that the oxygen reacts quantitatively with benzaldehyde to form perbenzoic acid initially, but as the reaction proceeds, the peracid concentration falls due to its decomposition and reaction with benzaldehyde. The initiating reaction was shown to be the interaction of the cobaltic ion with the aldehyde. The overall rate of oxidation can be explained by a kinetic scheme involving propagation, chain length, and activation energies of elementary reactions. The oxidation was inhibited by hydroquinone, diphenylamine, and -naphthol and retarded by benzoquinone.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
