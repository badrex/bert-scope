They found that the reaction is both homogeneous and strongly self-inhibited, with the pyrolysis being entirely free radical in character. The mechanism is based on a simple Rice-Herzfeld scheme, and self-inhibition is associated with the presence of isobutene. This research provides a better understanding of the early stages of the reaction and the role of self-inhibition in neopentane pyrolysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
