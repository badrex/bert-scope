Wright, explores the phenomenon of inter-traction, which causes reciprocal instreaming of fluids. He describes a new technique using a filter paper disc and cover-glass to observe horizontal streaming and discusses its implications for understanding molecular fields and interfacial tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
