They discovered that collagen has an inner hydration layer consisting of highly ordered water molecules and an outer layer of disordered water molecules. The inner hydration layer imparts kinetic stability to the collagen molecule, and the water chains may form a helix or lie in the inter-chain grooves of the collagen triple helix.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
