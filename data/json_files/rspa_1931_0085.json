The authors designed an improved vacuum system that allowed them to measure pressures as low as 10^-5 mmHg and maintain a constant pressure during experiments. This research contributed to a better understanding of electron emission and the potential applications in technology and science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
