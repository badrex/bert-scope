{"article_id": "109608", "revised_title": "The Reproduction of Buds in Plants", "semantic_tags": ["Plant reproduction", "Botany", "Plant growth", "Plant development", "Plant anatomy"], "tldr": "The author, Thomas Andrew Knight, investigates the reproduction of buds in plants and how they regenerate after being destroyed. He discovers that buds can be reproduced from the alburnum of the root and that this process is not present in annual or biennial plants. Knight also explores the possibility of lateral and terminal orifices of the alburnous tubes generating central vessels, which give existence to reproduced buds and leaves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
