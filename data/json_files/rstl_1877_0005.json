They found that five minutes of boiling was sufficient to sterilize various types of infusions, and that atmospheric air played a crucial role in the development of life in organic infusions. The author's findings challenged previous theories and contributed to the understanding of microbiology and sterilization techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
