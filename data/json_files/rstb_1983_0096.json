The authors emphasize the importance of studying target cells and using organ cultures to assess the effects of pathogens on host organisms. They also highlight the impact of viruses on the host's immune system, particularly the function of polymorphonuclear leucocytes, and the potential for viruses to alter susceptibility to bacterial infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
