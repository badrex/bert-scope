The authors found that the range of temperature variations is considerable and often changes rapidly. They also observed that normal differences of temperature appear to vary with the average air temperature, increasing negatively as the temperature falls. The system of recording can be applied to other meteorological data and may help in forecasting weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
