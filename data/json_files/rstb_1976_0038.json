The exopodite apparatus provides lift and propulsive power in the first three larval stages. The setal arrangement and display increase surface area during power strokes, and the unique musculature is involved in rotational movements of the appendage. The research also analyzes the limb coordination during swimming and compares it with post-larval locomotory systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
