The author, Henry Bence Jones, found that acute affections of the nervous system are the only diseases with an excess of phosphatic salts in the urine. In contrast, functional diseases like delirium tremens show a remarkable decrease in phosphate secretion. The research also highlights that chronic diseases do not exhibit significant excesses in phosphatic salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
