The authors find that the reaction-diffusion equations can have an infinite number of solutions in spherical geometry with Dirichlet boundary conditions. Precise numerical computations reveal the evolution of temperature and reaction-rate profiles as a bifurcation parameter is varied, providing a quantitative confirmation of the qualitative theories. The results show that the stationary-state locus has a high degree of multiplicity, with 13 branches of solutions found for the chosen parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
