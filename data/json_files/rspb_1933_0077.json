The research found that the mammary glands undergo significant changes during each phase, with growth and changes primarily consisting of alterations in the existing cells in the duct endings rather than a sudden burst of mitosis. The study also observed that there is no luteal phase in the mammary cycle of the unmated albino mouse, and growth ceases at oestrus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
