He discovered that carbonic acid performs a double function in the economy of growing plants: it undergoes decomposition in the leaves under sunlight, supplying carbon to the growing plant and restoring oxygen to the atmosphere. Additionally, it acts as a solvent, conveying insoluble compounds from the soil into the plant's interior. This research has implications for understanding plant physiology, soil composition, and mineral waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
