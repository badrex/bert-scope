The author categorizes situations into five model cases and examines each case in detail, deciding whether the simple theory of Huxley and Ratcliffe is applicable. The article also discusses improvements to the theory, considering the effect of the Earth's magnetic field, reflected waves, point transmitters, and transmitter power on the ionospheric cross-modulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
