The research found that all hydrocarbons were strongly bonded to the surface, and the dissociation of some hydrocarbons formed the same surface species. The desorption of hydrocarbons released a significant fraction of their hydrogen when heated in vacuo. The hydrogenation of adsorbed carbon monoxide was also studied, and a reaction mechanism is proposed to explain the observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
