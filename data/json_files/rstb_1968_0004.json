They discovered a complicated structure called the perinephric membrane, which plays a role in the removal of water from the faeces. The rectal complex takes up potassium against a concentration gradient, and the high osmolarity of the fluids within the complex is brought about by the inward secretion of potassium chloride at the leptophragmata. This study provides insights into the functioning of the rectal complex in mealworms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Anatomy"}
