The natural remanent magnetization of these rocks is shown to be unstable in the geomagnetic field, and the secondary component is attributed to a geocentric axial dipole field in Britain. The findings contribute to the understanding of the magnetization of unstable rocks and the history of Earth's magnetic field."}
