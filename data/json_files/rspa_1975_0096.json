They found that the down-glacier flanks of these hummocks are particularly susceptible to failure, which helps explain the asymmetric forms observed in bedrock hummocks revealed beyond the retreating margins of modern glaciers. The study suggests that large-scale fracturing due to glacially induced stresses in bedrock is a major mechanism of glacial erosion.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomechanics"}
