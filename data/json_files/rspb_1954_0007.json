They found that serum, peritoneal exudate, and lymphocyte suspensions from immunized animals do not confer immunity. The study focuses on inbred lines of mice, CBA, C57, and Ai, to understand the transfer of immunity and its implications in transplantation and tumor immunity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
