They find that this competition can lead to a wide range of virulence levels being maintained in the parasite population and an average virulence higher than what would be optimal for the spread of the parasite in the host population. This model is relevant for highly mutating parasites, such as the human immunodeficiency virus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
