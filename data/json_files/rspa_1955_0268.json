The author finds that while a non-rotating mass has a continuous set of free torsional periods, a rotating mass has only a discrete set. The Coriolis forces can slow down the oscillations, but their effect is generally small in real stars. The study also considers the impact of axial symmetry and the influence of unstable regions on the oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
