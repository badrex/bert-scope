The research reveals that acidification has led to a decrease in midge diversity, productivity, and survival potential. The most significant changes in midge faunas occurred when the pH dropped below 5.0-5.5, which may be explained by decreased environmental stability, increased toxic aluminum concentrations, and changes in microorganisms and algae that serve as food for midges. The study supports the idea that oligotrophication is a feature of acidified lakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
