They observed a cubic-field Stark splitting and a fluorine hyperfine structure due to covalent bonding with fluorine ligands. The results provide insights into the incorporation of impurity ions into the crystal lattice and the effects of covalent bonding on the crystal field splitting of S-state ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
