It demonstrates that serotonin, acetylcholine, and other neurotransmitters can activate a common effector system, suggesting that they may all link into a common receptor-channel coupling system. This system involves phosphoinositide metabolism and calcium liberation, leading to the opening of chloride channels in the oocyte membrane.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
