They discover that the process of coagulation is reversible and depends on the concentration of salt in the system. The author also finds that the addition of a small amount of sodium chloride to muscle is sufficient to create a coagulable plasma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
