Additionally, it presents findings on an apparatus for measuring self-induction coefficients and investigating alternating currents phenomena, as well as a preliminary note on a method for harmonic analysis of alternating currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycetozoa", "sub_discipline": "Cellular Biology"}
