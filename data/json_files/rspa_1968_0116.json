The theory considers the effects of magnetic fields on electron temperature and electron number density distribution, providing a better agreement between theory and experimental measurements for magnetic fields less than 300 G. The findings can help improve our understanding of plasma behavior and its applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
