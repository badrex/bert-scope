The author presents operator equivalences for potential forms and their matrix elements, tabulating them over a range of total angular momentum that includes the states of all rare-earth ions. The study aims to relate the crystal splitting observed spectroscopically to the crystal-field parameters in rare-earth double nitrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
