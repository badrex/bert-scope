The study provides strong evidence for the theory of mimicry proposed by H. W. Bates and sheds light on various aspects of evolutionary biology, such as the role of females in mimicry, the ancestral form of the butterflies, and the conditions under which mimicry appears in closely-related species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
