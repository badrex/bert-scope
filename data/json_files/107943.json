They compare their results with previous experiments by Dulong and Petit, and discuss the expansion of various metals, including platinum, iron, and copper. The author also provides a detailed method for determining the expansion of metals to their melting points and discusses the implications of their findings for the accuracy of temperature measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
