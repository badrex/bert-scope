This method extends a successful room temperature design process using performance indices and material-selection charts. The authors define a 'design strength' to characterize material response under design-imposed conditions and rank materials using an optimization procedure to meet design specifications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
