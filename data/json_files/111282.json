Church and William H. Perkin, discovered a new substance called nitrosophenyline, which produces a crimson coloration when acted upon by nascent hydrogen in an alcoholic solution of dinitrobenzole or nitraniline. They also found that similar coloration can be produced from other dinitro-compounds. The new substance has remarkable properties and can be used as a coloring matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
