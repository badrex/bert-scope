It found a topographical relationship between the two, with the trajectory of a fibre depending on the mediolateral position of its cell body within the nucleus. The researchers propose a hypothesis based on the development of the tectum in Xenopus and the timing of mes. V cell production to explain this relationship.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
