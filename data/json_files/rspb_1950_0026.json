They found that the minimum movement required to excite a single corpuscle was 100 microns, and that subthreshold mechanical stimuli could facilitate stimulation by electrical test shocks. The results can be explained in terms of the known properties of axons, without the need for any other intermediate mechanisms. This research provides more information on the fundamental mechanism of sensory receptors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
