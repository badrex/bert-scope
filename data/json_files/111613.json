They discovered a new compound, hydrolchlorate of acrolein, formed by the direct combination of aldehyde and acid. Additionally, they found a new isomer of acrolein, metacrolein, which has different properties and reactions. These findings expanded the understanding of aldehyde and acid chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
