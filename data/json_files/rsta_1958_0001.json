It examines the flow of oil between the rollers and the factors affecting the film thickness. The study finds that the film thickness decreases with increasing load and speed, and the oil film thickness at low loads is less than predicted by previous theories. The effective viscosity of the oil is also found to be lower than the inlet oil viscosity, possibly due to frictional heating.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
