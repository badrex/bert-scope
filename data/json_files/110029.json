He restores confidence in the results of observations made with the mural circle at Greenwich and highlights a want of uniformity in the proper motions of stars, indicating a slow change in their positions. The study focuses on the southward motion of stars like Capella, Procyon, and Sirius, and the author also mentions the use of an artificial horizon of mercury for observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
