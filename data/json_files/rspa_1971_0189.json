It involves the construction of 16 large dams, 7 power stations, and 160 km of tunnelling. The purpose of the scheme is to provide peak load power for the Australian Capital Territory and the States of New South Wales and Victoria, as well as supplying large quantities of water for irrigation. The scheme is designed to trap the unused waters of the Snowy River and its tributaries and divert them to the inland flowing Murray and Murrumbidgee rivers to augment agricultural and pastoral production.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Civil Engineering"}
