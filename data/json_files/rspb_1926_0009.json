The researchers found that visible rays had no inhibitory effect on the exciting effects of ultra-violet rays on involuntary muscle. They also discovered that the presence of calcium is necessary for the increase of muscle tone produced by ultra-violet rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
