They discovered that the correlation between stations varies in summer and winter months and that there is a zone of positive correlation followed by a zone of negative correlation. The authors also found that the barometric height at a station is more closely related to stations in the southern hemisphere than to those closer by.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
