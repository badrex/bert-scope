The authors describe modifications to the technique, allowing accurate measurements on high-strength metals and alloys at strain rates up to about 10^3 s^-1. They also discuss the accuracy of the technique and assess errors arising from nonlinearity in the instrumentation, dispersion, frictional restraint, and inertia.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
