It explores the various ways host cells defend themselves against intruders, the strategies used by successful intracellular parasites to survive and multiply, and the competition between host cells and parasites for resources. The study emphasizes the complex relationship between host cells and intracellular parasites, highlighting the need to understand these interactions for potential medical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
