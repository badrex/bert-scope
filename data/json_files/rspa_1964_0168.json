At high speeds or low temperatures, there is high friction with massive transfer and movement of the polymer. At low speeds and moderate temperatures, a thin fibrous PTFE film is formed with low friction due to easy shear of relevant crystal units. The findings suggest that the relaxation process responsible for PTFE friction is different from that in other polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
