He found that the main outlines of land and sea did not change significantly, and the snow around the south pole appeared less extensive than in previous observations. Phillips also discussed the ruddy tint of Mars' surface and the possibility of a deep atmospheric zone affecting the planet's climate. He concluded that Mars is likely habitable and has a spheroidal shape, which is exceptional among planets.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
