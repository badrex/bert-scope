It discusses the discontinuous nature of these transitions in crystalline systems and the role of electron-electron interactions. The author also explores the Mott transition, which occurs when antiferromagnetic order splits the energy bands, and the concept of Hubbard bands. The article highlights the importance of understanding these transitions for the development of new materials and devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
