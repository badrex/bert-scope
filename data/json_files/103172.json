It also includes a table of the specific gravity of each stratum. The authors discuss the different types of coal, such as Slipper-Coal, Spin-Coal, and Stone Coal, as well as the iron ores found in the area. They note that the specific gravities of the strata are not in any particular order, suggesting a random or chance-based distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
