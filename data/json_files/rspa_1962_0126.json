They found that the band intensities vary with the refractive index of the mixture and that the intensity changes are influenced by the resonance Raman effect caused by substituent groups in the aromatic ring. The results suggest that further examination of the corrections made for reflexion losses in Raman measurements is necessary to understand the underlying causes of the observed effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
