He discovered that the iron used in the construction of ships creates a magnetic focus of attraction that influences the compass needle, causing errors in the observed variation. This phenomenon affects navigation and can lead to ships being off course. Scoresby suggests that this anomaly is also influenced by the direction of the ship's head and the dip of the needle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
