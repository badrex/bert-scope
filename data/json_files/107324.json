He found that silicated fluoric acid gas contains 61.4% silex and 38.6% fluoric acid. He also discovered that water can decompose silicated fluoric acid gas and that subsilicated fluoric acid is decomposed by ammonia, fixed alkalies, and various earths. The author's findings contribute to the understanding of fluoric acid and its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
