The author highlights the significance of nitrogen complexes in providing a potential mild route from nitrogen to ammonia using chemically weak reducing systems. The author also discusses the electronic structure of the nitrogen molecule and how transition metal ions can attack it through a concerted electron-acceptor and electron-donor action.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
