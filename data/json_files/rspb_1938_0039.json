The authors found that the sandfly species Phlebotomus major is the primary vector for the disease, and its population is closely associated with the occurrence of visceral leishmaniasis. The study also highlights the role of Cooley's disease in the differential diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis and the importance of environmental factors, such as vegetation and humidity, in the distribution of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology and Disease Control"}
