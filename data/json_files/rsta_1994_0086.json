The authors describe the balance between minimizing the area of contact between incompatible chain segments and maximizing the conformational entropy of macromolecules in these systems. They explore the various microdomain geometries, such as spheres, cylinders, and lamellae, and introduce the ordered bicontinuous double diamond (OBDD) structure. The article also highlights the importance of understanding grain boundary structures and their impact on the properties of microphase-separated materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
