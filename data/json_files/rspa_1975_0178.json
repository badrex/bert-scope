They used the elastic Green displacement tensor and a simplified discrete atomic model to obtain the displacements near the cross-link, providing a better understanding of the effects of cross-linking on the physical properties of polyethylene crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Polymer Science"}
