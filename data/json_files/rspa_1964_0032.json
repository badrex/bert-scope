They found that all three systems are associated and have endothermic heats of mixing, suggesting that N-H hydrogen bonds are involved. The authors also provided evidence of hydrogen bond formation using nuclear magnetic resonance spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
