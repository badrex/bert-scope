W. Gifford and Prof. T. M. Lowry. They encountered challenges in attaching the sides of the hollow quartz prism, which were resolved by using an aqueous cement. The researchers found that nicotine was a solvent of various materials, making it difficult to create a stable setup. They successfully completed the measurements and provided refractive indices for different wavelengths, contributing to the understanding of nicotine's optical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
