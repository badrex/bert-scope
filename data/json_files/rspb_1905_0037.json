They found that the amount of carbon-dioxide assimilation a leaf can perform is affected by the temperature of the assimilating cells and the intensity of natural illumination. The study also explored the heating effect of natural illumination on leaves and the internal temperature of leaves exposed to different degrees of natural light.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
