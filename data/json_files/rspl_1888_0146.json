They suggest that the slowing of circulation in the neighborhood of the thoracic duct, particularly in cases of valvular heart disease and obstruction to lung circulation, can lead to fibrinogen intoxication. This finding challenges the common belief that cardiac dropsy is due to mechanical obstruction of the circulation."}
