The authors found that increasing weights and temperatures can prolong the latency period, while decreasing weights and temperatures can shorten it. They also discovered that there is no significant difference in latency between curarized and non-curarized muscles when stimulated directly.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
