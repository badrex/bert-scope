The research finds that the intrusions were derived from both mantle and crustal sources, with the majority being dominated by recycled continental crust. The findings contribute to the understanding of the petrogenesis of the British Caledonian Granitoids.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Igneous Petrology"}
