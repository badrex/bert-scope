They found that the scattering amplitudes deviate from the form-factor for a Dirac K electron, but the deviations are not very significant. The results provide insights into the behavior of y-rays and their interactions with heavy atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
