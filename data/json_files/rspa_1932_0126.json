They find that some electrodes exhibit strong valve action but do not effectively rectify alternating currents. The study emphasizes the distinction between valve action and rectifying action as two separate phenomena and highlights the role of chemical reactions at the electrodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
