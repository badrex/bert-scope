E. Hughes presents a new theory of magnetism based on experimental research. He suggests that each molecule of magnetic metal is a separate magnet with its own poles and polarity. The inherent polarity of each molecule is a constant quantity and cannot be augmented or destroyed. When there is no apparent magnetism, the molecules arrange themselves to satisfy their mutual attraction. In evident magnetism, the molecules rotate symmetrically in a given direction, forming a complete closed circuit of attraction. Hughes believes his theory is supported by numerous experimental evidences and plans to present the experimental evidence in the near future.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
