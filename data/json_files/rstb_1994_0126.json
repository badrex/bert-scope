It challenges the idea that children's initial step in grammar construction is to discover patterns for positioning words that instantiate relational concepts learned independently of language. Instead, it argues that meaning as it is expressed in children's early sentences is, from the beginning, organized on the basis of experience with the grammar and lexicon of a particular language.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Development"}
