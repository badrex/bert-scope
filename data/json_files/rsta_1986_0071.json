EELS offers high sensitivity and a wide spectral range, allowing for the observation of more vibrational modes than optical methods. The article highlights various techniques and their limitations, as well as the importance of understanding coverage-dependent frequency shifts and dipole coupling for proper interpretation of transmission spectra from supported catalysts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
