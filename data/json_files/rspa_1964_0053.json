They measured the threshold voltage at which the first visible discharge occurs in a homogeneous field electrode gap, using various gases at different values of gap and gas pressure. The study included spectroscopic analysis and high-speed photography to reveal the characteristics of the discharges and the transition from an electron avalanche to a streamer or glow discharge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
