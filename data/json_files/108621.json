The authors argue that the movement of glaciers is not due to their semifluidity, but rather to the regelation process, where ice pieces are cemented together when pressed. They provide experiments and observations to support their theory, which challenges the existing notion of glaciers as ice rivers.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
