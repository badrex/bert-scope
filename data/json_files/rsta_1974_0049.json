The research focuses on the reflection of waves from interfaces between different elastic materials and provides a detailed analysis of various material responses, including polycrystalline solids, metals, water, and gases. The findings can be applied to a wide range of systems described by the nonlinear wave equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
