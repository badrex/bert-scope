The cells are elongated with pointed ends and have a high pectin content, which distinguishes them from sclerenchyma cells. The wall thickening occurs early in the elongation period and consists of lamellae running completely around the cell. The study reveals that the cellulose chains in the wall are oriented longitudinally, and the cells show a remarkable uniformity in their structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
