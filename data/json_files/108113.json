He observed ancient castles, examined geological formations, and studied the changes in the Baltic Sea level. Lyell found numerous proofs of the land's gradual rising, which supports the Huttonian theory of continents being subject to expansive forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
