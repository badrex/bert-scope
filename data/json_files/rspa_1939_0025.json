They argue that melting is a first-order transition with latent heat and relatively little \"premelting.\" The authors introduce a new definition of order and apply the Bragg-Williams theory to explain the melting process, emphasizing the importance of co-operative effects and the distortion of the crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
