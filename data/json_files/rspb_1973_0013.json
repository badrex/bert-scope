The coat is secreted by the calyx cells and provides protection against host defense reactions. The particles are produced in the nuclei of the calyx cells and are released into the lumen of the reproductive tract, where they coat the oocytes as they pass through. The particles are membrane-bound and have a unique structure that provides insights into their origin and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
