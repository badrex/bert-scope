They derive the wave equation for ferrites and explore the anisotropic and dispersive nature of waves in these materials. The study provides insight into phenomena such as cut-offs, resonances, and wave-focusing, which are crucial for understanding wave behavior in ferrites.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
