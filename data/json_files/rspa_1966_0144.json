The experiment involves using high-precision atomic beam techniques, such as those used in atomic clocks, to measure frequency shifts caused by the mass changes. The author predicts that the frequency shifts will be inversely proportional to the plate separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
