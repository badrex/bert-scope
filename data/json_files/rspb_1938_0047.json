They discovered that anti-sera can selectively neutralize the luteinizing activity of gonadotrophic extracts, allowing for the study of the separate effects of follicle-stimulating and luteinizing hormones. This research helps in understanding the complex interactions of hormones in the pituitary gland and their impact on the ovaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
