The authors establish a sequence of drift deposits and differentiate between Older Drift and Newer Drift. They also study the lithology, disposition, and fauna of both types of drift deposits and make suggested correlations with neighboring areas. The deposits of the Catuvelaunian episode are shown to be largely of clay or sand laid down in a lake named 'Lake Harrison', which was part of the Trent system. The authors trace the history of previous research in the area and provide a detailed account of the Pleistocene succession."}
