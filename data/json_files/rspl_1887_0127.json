They found that the young sexual cells, both male and female, are found in the ectoderm of the ccenosarcal canals. The author observed the process of fertilization, embryo development, and the absence of medusiform gonophores in Millepora, supporting the views of Hertwigs and Weismann that the ectoderm is the original seat of sexual cells in Hydrozoa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
