The authors used various methods, including Brunner's method and Bunsen's dilatometer, to obtain accurate results. They found the density of ice at 0\u00b0C to be around 0.917, and the coefficient of cubical expansion to be around 0.0000375. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the physical properties of ice and its applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryology"}
