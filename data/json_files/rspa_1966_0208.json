The model considers the pinning force exerted by precipitate particles on grain boundaries and the release of grain boundary energy during grain growth. The authors predict a critical particle size that depends on the volume fraction of the second phase, the matrix grain size, and the degree of heterogeneity of the matrix. The theory helps to understand the abnormal grain growth (secondary recrystallization) that occurs in certain steels.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
