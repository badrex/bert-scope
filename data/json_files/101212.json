He finds that needles always conform to the magnetic meridian regardless of the touch, and that the nature of the steel and its temper play a significant role in its magnetic properties. He also claims to have successfully infused magnetic virtue into a piece of steel, allowing it to conform to the magnetic meridian without a load-stone.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
