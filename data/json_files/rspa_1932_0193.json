The authors develop a new instrument to measure molecular areas accurately and study the transition phenomena in the films. They find that four factors, including the length of the hydrocarbon chain and the nature of the underlying solution, influence the film's structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
