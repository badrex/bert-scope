The author finds that at low pressures, the Stark intensities observed by Mark and Wierl are confirmed, but at high pressures, a new intensity distribution appears. The author explains this phenomenon and provides an experimental setup to study these effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
