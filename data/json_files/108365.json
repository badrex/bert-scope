They found that these creatures feed on the secretion within sebaceous cells and reproduce through ova. The presence of these animalcules is not related to skin diseases and can be found in most people, especially those with naturally sluggish skin or in poor health. The Entozoon Folliculorum has a unique structure with a head that can retract into the thorax and an abdomen with annelid-like features. They are resilient creatures, surviving for days after their host's death.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
