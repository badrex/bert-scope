Hauksbee conducted an experiment to study the behavior of malt dust in an evacuated receiver at Gresham College. He found that when the air was removed, the malt dust descended as a heavy body, falling straight lines from the top to the bottom of the receiver. This demonstrated the effect of air pressure on the movement of particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
