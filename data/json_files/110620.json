The tremors were slight and mainly felt in the island's southern parts. The earthquake was accompanied by a harsh and grating sound, but no significant agitation of the sea was observed. Additionally, a paper was partially read about the marine origin of the Parallel Roads of Glen Roy and other parts of Lochaber.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
