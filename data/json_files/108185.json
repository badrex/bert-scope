He proposes that ordinary induction is an action of contiguous particles consisting of a species of polarity, rather than an action of particles or masses at sensible distances. This discovery has significant implications for understanding the laws governing electrical forces and the connection between induction, chemical decomposition, and other electrical phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
