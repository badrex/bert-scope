It describes the cross-polarization-magic-angle spinning (CP-MAS) experiment, which provides high-resolution NMR spectra of solid materials. The technique is useful for analyzing amorphous systems, crystalline materials, and chemically exchanging solid systems, offering a bridge between solid-state and solution structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
