They argue that the proportions and forms of ships should be adjusted based on the weight of their armor, and that adopting a form of greater resistance can lead to increased efficiency and economy. The author provides examples of different ship designs and compares their dimensions, weight, and performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval architecture"}
