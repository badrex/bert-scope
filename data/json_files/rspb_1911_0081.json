They used an Abbe refractometer to measure the refractive indices of the aqueous humor, cornea, and lens. The results showed unique phenomena, such as the tendency towards a \"negative eye\" in some species, which is corrected by the lens's refractive index.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
