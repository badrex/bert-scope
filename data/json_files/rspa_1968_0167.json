They found that high pressures of cis-butene-2 inhibit the decomposition of the ketone and cause small amounts of isomerization. The study supports the hypothesis that the singlet state is involved in the interaction with olefines, and the authors discuss the nature of these interactions and their implications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
