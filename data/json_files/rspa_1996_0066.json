They discovered that the pressure change in the column caused by adding a small perturbation gas flow significantly affects the adsorption isotherms. The study provides a correction term to compensate for the pressure effect, leading to a single isotherm for each component in the gas mixture.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
