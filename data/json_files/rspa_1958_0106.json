They found that the pressure change was a true measure of the reaction's extent. The main products were water, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, and smaller amounts of hydrogen, methane, ethylene, propylene, cyclopentene, formaldehyde, and higher aldehydes. The authors proposed a reaction scheme that explains the products and some kinetic results, suggesting that cyclopentylperoxy radicals played a significant role in the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
