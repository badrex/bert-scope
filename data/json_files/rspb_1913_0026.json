They discovered that the presence of chromogens in flowers is related to anthocyan pigment formation. The recovery of color in decolorized petals supports the conclusion that anthocyanic pigments arise from the oxidation of chromogens. The study also highlights the role of reducing agents in the loss of color in dehydrated petals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
