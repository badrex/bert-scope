The research also discusses the origins of the optic nerves, the role of Meynert's commissure, and the evolution of the brain's optic centers. The findings suggest that cortical fibers play a role in connecting motor and other centers of the cortex in response to visual stimuli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
