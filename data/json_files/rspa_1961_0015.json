The authors found that the reaction rate increases with pressure and temperature, and they proposed a reaction mechanism involving the recombination of radicals. The results show that the reaction order is higher in a packed vessel due to increased surface recombination of radicals, and the reaction rate is more affected by surface removal of radicals at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
