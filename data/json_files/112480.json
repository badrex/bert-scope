W. Hofmann, discovered a new series of homologous compounds to hydrocyanic acid, including cyanide of amyl and phenyl. These compounds are formed by the action of chloroform on primary monamines. The author studied their properties and reactions, comparing them to the cyanide of phenyl and hydrocyanic acid. The existence of these new homologues allows for the prediction of another series of homologues of cyanogen, which will be produced by the action of chloroform on diamines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
