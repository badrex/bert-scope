His work on the Wever-Bray effect, the saccule's response to vibration, and the role of tympanic muscles in hearing protection laid the foundation for future research in the field. Hallpike's discoveries in Meniere's disease and his investigations into the cochlea's physical mechanism have had lasting impacts on the study of hearing and balance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
