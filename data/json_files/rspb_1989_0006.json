When females base their preferences on variance in a cue correlated with male viability, a rare display can evolve to fixation if it amplifies the differences in males, increasing the resolution power of females with respect to the original cue. This can lead to the evolution of choice based on the display's expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
