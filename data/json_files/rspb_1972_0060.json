It found that the peak chemosensitivity is confined to an area of postsynaptic membrane within a few micrometers of the nerve terminal, with a tenfold decline in sensitivity at 5-10 micrometers from the terminal. The study also suggests that most of the response obtained when ACh is released within 40 micrometers from the terminal is due to diffusion to the immediate postsynaptic area, and the extrasynaptic chemosensitivity of the muscle membrane is too low to be measured with the present methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
