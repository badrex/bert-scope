The research found a strong correlation between the expression of H-Y and the occurrence of the heterogametic-type gonad. The findings support the idea that the development of the mammalian testis is secondary to the interaction of soluble H-Y and a gonad H-Y receptor present in both sexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
