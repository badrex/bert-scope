The authors found that predominantly excitatory cells had disparity response profiles similar to their monocular responses, and cells with a preferred stimulus orientation within 30 degrees of the vertical showed binocular facilitations. The strength of binocular facilitation depended on stimulus contrast, decreasing with increasing contrast. The study aims to better understand the neural mechanisms underlying binocular depth perception.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
