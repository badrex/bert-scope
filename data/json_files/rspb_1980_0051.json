The model suggests that synapses exert effects on the growth of other synapses, with these effects extending over distances and varying in magnitude and sign. Interactions between synapses of the same eye type are stimulating for short distances and inhibitory for longer ones, while the reverse is true for interactions between synapses of opposite eye type. Computer simulations show that this model can reproduce the morphological features of monkey ocular dominance stripes, including Y- and T-type branches and terminations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
