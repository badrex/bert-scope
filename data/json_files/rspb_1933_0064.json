The results show that the response to light treatment is dependent on the presence of the anterior pituitary tissue, suggesting that additional illumination activates the anterior pituitary body, which in turn activates the reproductive organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
