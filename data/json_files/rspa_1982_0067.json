They found that despite the susceptibility of quaterrylene to damage by the electron beam, low-dose techniques allowed a detailed investigation of thin film growth and grain boundary structure. The high-resolution images recorded in the (110)-projection extended to about 0.25 nm, limited by radiation damage rather than microscope performance. The extensive crystal distortion observed at crystal junctions and boundaries is proposed to arise from individual molecular distortion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
