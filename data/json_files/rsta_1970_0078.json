The study investigates the effects of temperature gradients and the rate of solidification on the formation of cellular patterns and dendritic structures in the alloy. The research provides insights into the technological importance of solidification instabilities and the underlying principles of pattern-forming instabilities in dissipative systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Solidification"}
