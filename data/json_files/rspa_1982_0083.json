The author identifies the most general form of Hamilton's principle for perfect fluid flows and extends the variational principle to include viscous, thermally conducting fluid flows. The article compares this new approach with other variational principles for viscous flows and discusses their relative merits.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
