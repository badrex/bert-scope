They classify twinning modes into type I and type II and discuss the atomic shuffles accompanying the twinning shear in both single and multiple lattice structures. The theory is applicable to various crystal structures and orientation relationships, providing a basis for predicting operative twinning modes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
