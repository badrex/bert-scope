Dollond, describes an improved micrometer made of rock crystal for use in telescopes. This innovation simplifies micrometrical measurements by replacing the eye-glass with a rock crystal sphere, eliminating the need for angular cutting. The new micrometer also allows for easier angle adjustments and can take intermediate angles without reversing the eyepiece. This improvement enhances the functionality of telescopes in astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics in Telescope Design"}
