The results show that the steroid-stimulated LH surge is significantly correlated with the increase in the electrical activity of preoptic and anterior hypothalamic neurons. This research provides insights into the mechanism of ovarian steroid action on the neuroendocrine control of LH secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuroendocrinology"}
