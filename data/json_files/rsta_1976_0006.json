They discuss the two major orogenic cycles in the Proterozoic of Laurentia and the tectonic evolution that may have occurred during that time. The study provides insights into the nature of orogenesis and the changes in the Earth's crust during the Proterozoic era.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
