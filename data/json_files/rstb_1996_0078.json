The authors explore two models: biotic drift, which suggests that changes in the local biota cause shifts in mimicry rings, and the shifting balance theory, which posits that random genetic events and mutations lead to new color patterns. The study concludes that the shifting balance theory better explains the observed patterns of warning colors in Heliconius butterflies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
