The article explores the physical and chemical properties of these fibers and their biological effects, focusing on their ability to form small fibers that can be inhaled and deposited in the lungs. The article also examines the geological formation and occurrence of asbestos minerals, particularly in South Africa and other regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Mineralogy"}
