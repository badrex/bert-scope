He identified the neutron as part of the nucleus of the atom. Chadwick's research involved bombarding light elements with alpha particles, which led to the discovery of neutrons with no net charge and a mass approximately equal to that of a proton. This discovery significantly advanced the understanding of atomic research and earned Chadwick several prestigious awards, including the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1935.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
