The authors develop a direct formulation for various two-dimensional flow problems and discuss aspects of wave propagation in water. They also apply the theory to study one-dimensional steady motion, hydraulic jumps, and other fluid sheet problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
