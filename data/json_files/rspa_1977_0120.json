The results show that ethylene and halogeno-substituted alkenes adsorb irreversibly and dissociatively on the Fe(111) surface at 300 K. Carbon-carbon bond breaking of acetylene is observed at low coverage, while the chemisorption regime at higher coverages is more complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
