They found that chylomicra have a core made of triglycerides and a surface layer of phospholipids. The authors also discovered that the ultrastructure of chylomicra and artificial fat emulsions, like Intralipid, are very similar. This study provides insights into the composition and processing of lipids for electron microscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Lipid Metabolism"}
