Christie, investigates the diurnal variation of the magnetic needle and connects it to Professor Seebeck's discovery of thermo-magnetism. He conducts experiments with a thermo-magnetic apparatus, observing that heating a portion of the apparatus creates a temporary polarity. The author concludes that the earth and its atmosphere can be considered a thermo-magnetic combination, with two magnetic poles produced on each side of the equator. This hypothesis is supported by comparing the observed deviations of a compass with those produced by the artificial imitation of the thermo-magnetic apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geomagnetism"}
