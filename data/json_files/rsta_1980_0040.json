The authors compare Doppler results with other space systems and find that a scale decrease of 0.4+ 0.1 part/ 10^6 and a longitude rotation of 0.8 + 0.05 \" eastward should be applied to the Doppler results. The study emphasizes the importance of intercomparing different reduction programs to obtain more universally applicable scale and orientation corrections.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
