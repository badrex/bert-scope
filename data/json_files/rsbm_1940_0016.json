He is best known for his work on the isolation and identification of tryptophane and his research on globulin. Mellanby's experiments on the effects of neutral salts on protein precipitation and solubility provided valuable insights into the dynamic nature of protein-salt systems. His work laid the foundation for future research in protein chemistry and biochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
