The research also examines light-initiated redox reactions in these systems when adjacent to a liquid phase containing a redox pair. The findings provide insights into the interactions between chlorophyll and quinones, which play a crucial role in photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
