They found that the primary action in methyl elaeostearate is the simultaneous addition of two hydrogen molecules to one molecule of elaeostearate, forming large proportions of octadeca-11-enoic esters. The selectivity of the hydrogenation process was studied in equimolecular binary mixtures of methyl elaeostearate with methyl oleate, linoleate, and linolenate. The results showed that selective hydrogenation is mainly due to the specific pentadiene system in the esters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
