They determined the energies and intensities of gamma rays, analyzed the spin and parity of excited states, and investigated the angular correlation between gamma-ray cascades. Their findings provide insights into the nuclear structure and decay processes of manganese-56.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
