He discusses historical experiments and observations, and through his own experiments, he concludes that the inferior temperature of water in a tube is due to evaporation. This study contributes to the understanding of boiling phenomena and the role of evaporation in heat transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
