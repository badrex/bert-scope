They discussed the basic physical principles, requirements, and limitations of these mechanisms and analyzed the detectability of radiation emitted or absorbed by stimulus molecules. The study concluded that radiation mechanisms might only operate in rare special cases and cannot account for pheromone detection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
