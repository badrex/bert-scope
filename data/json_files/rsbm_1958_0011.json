Born in Birmingham in 1878, Horton studied at King Edward's School and Mason College, where he earned a First Class External Honours degree in physics and chemistry. He worked under the guidance of Professor J. H. Pointing and later, J. J. Thomson at the Cavendish Laboratory. Horton's research focused on the properties of matter, including the torsional rigidity of quartz fibers and the effects of temperature on the modulus of torsional rigidity of metal wires. He also served as an editor for several physics publications and played a significant role in the administration of the University of Birmingham. Throughout his life, Horton was known for his meticulous and painstaking work, as well as his ability to connect with people and foster a sense of community within the scientific community.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Physics Education"}
