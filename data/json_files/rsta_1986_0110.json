The authors combine surface-Rayleigh-wave velocity measurements with normal shear-wave birefringence to determine the difference in principal stresses in the plane of the metal plate. The theory is tested on two aluminum plates, comparing the results with neutron diffraction determination of the crystallite orientation distribution function.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Texture Analysis"}
