The research shows that X-ray sterilisation during pregnancy causes premature regression of the corpora lutea, while sterilisation during lactation leads to the permanent survival of corpora lutea. The findings suggest that neither follicles nor corpora lutea are essential for the maintenance of the oestrous cycle in unmated animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
