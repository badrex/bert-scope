The molecules have a trans configuration and lie parallel and end to end in pairs within an ionic framework. The two isoprene units have normal interatomic distances but are linked by a shorter C-C bond. This bond feature is accompanied by a coplanar arrangement with adjacent carbon bonds. The study provides insights into the structure of complex organic molecules and the development of polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
