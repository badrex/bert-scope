The results show that while motor nerves can restore coordinated movement, sensory nerves do not show a special tendency to innervate their original skin areas. This implies that any modifiability of sensory innervation resides in the central terminations within the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
