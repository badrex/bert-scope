The study involves the use of spectroscopy and quantum mechanics to understand the molecular structure and behavior of magnesium hydride. The research also discusses the isotope effect observed in the spectrum, which is caused by the presence of isotopes in the magnesium atom.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
