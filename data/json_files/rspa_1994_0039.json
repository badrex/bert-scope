They used Ubbelohde viscometers to obtain accurate and reliable results, which were compared with existing data. The study found that the kinematic viscosity of the mixtures depends on the glycerol mass fraction in a strongly nonlinear manner, and provides an empirical correlation for calculating the viscosity of the mixture based on the viscosities of water and glycerol, and the mass fraction of glycerol.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fluid Dynamics"}
