The authors found that the charge is not produced by hydrolytic ions (OH- and H+) but is mainly due to stray ions (X- and X+) present in the water. The research also shows that the greater the purity of the water, the lower the mobility of the bubble, indicating that the charge on the bubble is influenced by the presence of impurities in the water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
