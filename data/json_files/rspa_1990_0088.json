The model considers the effects of porosity, fibre orientation, and microstructure on thermal conductivity. The authors use the Bruggemann analysis to calculate the thermal conductivity of the composite materials, taking into account the geometry of the porosity and the thermal conductivities of the individual components. The results demonstrate the importance of the highly oriented matrix graphite in the thermal transport properties of carbon-carbon fibre composites.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Composite Materials"}
