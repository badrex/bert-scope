They observed the generation of pressure waves at the flame front and the development of the flow field ahead of the flame. The results showed that the transition from a wrinkled laminar to a turbulent flame significantly influenced the process of flame acceleration. The findings provide valuable information for understanding the formation of detonation waves in gaseous media.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
