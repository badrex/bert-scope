Plastoquinone-45 (PQ-45) is an essential component of the photosynthetic electron transport chain, acting as an electron carrier between photosystem II and photosystem I. The author explains how plastoquinone plays a role in energy conservation through proton translocation across the thylakoid membrane, leading to ATP formation. The article also mentions the use of plastoquinone antagonists, such as DBMIB, to study the role of plastoquinone in electron flow and photophosphorylation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
