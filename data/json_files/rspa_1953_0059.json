They discuss the process of projective reduction, organization of numerical calculations, and the choice of initial functions. The study also introduces new checking procedures and classification methods to improve accuracy and efficiency in wave function calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
