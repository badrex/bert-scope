They find that chains of SbS5 groups in Sb2S3 crystals are lengthened by incorporating PbS, forming new structures related to cannizzarite and galena. These structures can be ordered or disordered, creating homologous series of phases or operationally non-stoichiometric phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
