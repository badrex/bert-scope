They found that the expansion chamber provided more accurate range measurements than the scintillation method, and that it could distinguish between alpha-particles and other particles, such as protons. The results supported recent theories about the ranges of alpha-particle groups emitted by radioactive substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
