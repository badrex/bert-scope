They discovered that regular ripple-marks are formed by a complex arrangement of vortices in oscillating water. The study also showed that a uniform current can prolong existing ripples, and that vortices play a significant role in the formation and development of ripple-marks.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
