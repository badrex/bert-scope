The researchers found that trimethoprim and 2,4-diaminopyrimidine affect the same three histidine residues, while folate, dihydrofolate, and folinic acid have identical effects on the histidine residues. The findings provide insights into the understanding of the effects of structural changes on ligand binding to proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
