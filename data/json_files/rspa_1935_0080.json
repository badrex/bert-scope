They discovered that hydrogen can slow down and scatter neutrons, leading to increased activation of certain elements. This phenomenon is explained by the higher efficiency of slow neutrons in capturing nuclei compared to fast ones. The authors also discuss the absorption of slow neutrons in various elements, finding anomalously large absorption coefficients for some elements like boron, which has implications for nuclear physics and the development of nuclear reactors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
