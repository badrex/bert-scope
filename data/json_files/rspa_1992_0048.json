They found that most halides follow an approximate linear relationship between entropy change and relative volume change on melting. However, some systems, such as fast-ion conductors, strongly structured network-like systems, and molecular systems, show a deficit of entropy of melting. The authors discuss these deviations in correlation with structural and transport data, providing insights into the behavior of these unique systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
