They find that substances that lower the surface tension of water generally have a greater inhibitory effect on gel formation. However, there are exceptions, such as narcotics and acetonitrile, which deviate from this generalization. The study highlights the complex relationship between surface tension, biological actions, and the formation of gels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
