It suggests that the release of maltose by symbiotic algae enables the host to conserve essential amino acids. The research also examines the feeding rates and composition of prey in a natural population of green hydra, as well as the source of ammonium released by the animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis and Nitrogen Recycling"}
