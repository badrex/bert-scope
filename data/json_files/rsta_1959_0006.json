The author derives a stress-strain relation and analyzes the breakdown of a smooth plastic compression wave into a shock wave, showing that the heat dissipated is proportional to the cube of the strain jump. The article also presents a solution for the elastic unloading of a plastic compression front during shock formation and provides a numerical illustration for a particular pulse in aluminum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
