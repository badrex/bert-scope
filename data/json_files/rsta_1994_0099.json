It examines the empirical evidence for chaos in financial markets and macroeconomic series, focusing on their forecastability and chaotic properties. The authors argue that while the case for economic chaos may be weak, the topic remains an open question for economic research. They explore the implications of chaos and nonlinear modeling on future economic research and discuss the challenges of analyzing short, noisy, and possibly non-stationary time series data.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Economics"}
