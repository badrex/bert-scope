He observed the heat of the waters at different locations and pumps, including the king's and queen's baths. He also compared the temperatures of various springs in and around Bath, such as St. James's church and the old and new well houses at Bristol. The study aimed to understand the heat sources and differences in temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
