The results show that the energy input is consistent with photo-ionization during the daytime, and a separate energy input from particles is observed at night. The study provides insights into the heating mechanisms and temperature variations in the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
