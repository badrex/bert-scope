He explains how the vocal tube adjusts to vibrate with the glottis, and how the larynx's position affects the pitch. Falsetto tones are produced by nodal divisions in the air column and vocal tube. The paper includes several illustrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
