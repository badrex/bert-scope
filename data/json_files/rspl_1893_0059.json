They discover that the ratio of internal energy absorbed by a molecule to the total energy absorbed per degree rise in temperature is the same for all gases with the same ratio of specific heats. The author also discusses the use of series expansions and the binomial theorem in mathematical physics, highlighting the importance of understanding the limits and equivalence of different formulas.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
