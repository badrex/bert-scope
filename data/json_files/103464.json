The growth was found to be connected to the ribs and inner intercostal muscles, and was surrounded by a thick membrane. Giffard observed that the growth was similar to bone in structure and was formed between the two layers of the pleura membrane. This case study provides insight into the unusual growth and its connection to the patient's symptoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Anatomy and Thoracic Surgery"}
