They used a clock with a pendulum made by Graham to compare the timekeeping in both locations. The results showed that the clock lost 54 minutes and 21 seconds in 26 revolutions of stars in Jamaica compared to London, indicating that the length of the pendulum was affected by the heat and the force of gravity in the two places.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
