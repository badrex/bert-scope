Handfield Jones, studied the liver's secretory apparatus and function. His research confirmed Mr. Bowman's view, opposing Mr. Kiernan's ideas. Jones found that the secreting process starts in the rows of epithelial cells surrounding the central axis of the lobule. The fluid is then transmitted to the cells at the margin of the lobule, where it is further processed and released into the surrounding duct.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
