The model produces oscillations with observed periods and damping constants, supporting the two-kinases hypothesis. This approach provides insights into the underlying mechanisms of photosynthetic oscillations and helps interpret the results in physiological terms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
