They found that for low and moderate Reynolds numbers, non-axisymmetric disturbances are the most unstable modes, leading to the formation of helical vortices. The study also extended the stability calculations to high Reynolds numbers, providing a better understanding of the fluid mechanics involved in this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
