It explores the role of serological H-Y antigen in primary gonadal differentiation and how it may be involved in the organization of the heterogametic gonad. The article also highlights the differences in sex determination mechanisms between placental mammals and non-mammalian vertebrates, and the importance of further research to better understand the genetics of sex determination in placental mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
