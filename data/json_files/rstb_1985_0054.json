It shows that specific reflex withdrawals to irritant chemical stimulation and local neurogenic inflammation, evoked by sensory C fibers, do not mature until postnatal day 10-11. The research also reveals that many dorsal horn cells do not respond to C-fiber input until the second week of life, which may explain the lack of specific C-evoked reflexes until that time. The development of interneuron networks responsible for spinal cord processing is proposed to be triggered by C-fiber afferent input.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
