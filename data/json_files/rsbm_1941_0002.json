He was born into a Jewish family in Freiberg, Moravia, and later moved to Vienna, where he lived until 1938. Freud studied medicine and worked in various departments, including the Institute of Cerebral Anatomy. He later specialized in clinical neurology and began private practice in Vienna. After studying with Jean-Martin Charcot in Paris, Freud developed a new approach to treating neurotic patients, eventually abandoning hypnosis in favor of a technique that focused on uncovering hidden mental processes. His work laid the foundation for modern psychology and psychoanalysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Psychoanalysis"}
