The study found that styrene units offer partial protection against radiation-induced degradation to neighboring isobutylene units. The copolymers first degrade and then partially cross-link into a gel structure. However, even with 80% styrene content, protection is only partial, and after high radiation doses, specimens separate into a gel and a low molecular weight fluid. The distribution of styrene and isobutylene units in the copolymer is either random or in very small blocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
