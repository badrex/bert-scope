The improved instrument has 16 channels, allowing for better horizontal resolution and more accurate temperature measurements. The authors discuss the challenges and considerations in designing the instrument, including calibration, cloud detection, and water vapor measurements. The radiometer provides valuable data for understanding global atmospheric temperature distribution and studying stratospheric phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
