H. Bragg and W. L. Bragg discovered that X-rays are reflected by crystals at specific angles, which helped them determine the atomic structure of materials. They found that the intensity of reflected X-rays varies depending on the angle and the arrangement of atoms within the crystal. This method, known as X-ray crystallography, revolutionized the study of atomic structure and material science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
