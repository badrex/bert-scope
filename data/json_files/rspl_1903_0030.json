They found that plants grew well in a mixture of carbon monoxide and oxygen, and that carbon monoxide was assimilated by the plants. This discovery supports Baeyer's theory of photosynthesis and shows that green plants can use carbon monoxide directly, which is contrary to the usually accepted ideas about plant growth in carbon monoxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
