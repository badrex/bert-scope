Hargreaves and R. H. Fowler, explore the effect of nuclear spin on optical spectra, focusing on the hyperfine structure and Zeeman effect in bismuth. They calculate the energy levels and separations, confirming the validity of previous assumptions and equations. The study provides insights into the interaction of nuclear and electron spins in atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
