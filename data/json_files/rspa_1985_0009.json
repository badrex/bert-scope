They found that the different photoreactivities of the compounds can be related to the extent of orbital overlap between potentially reactive double bonds in their crystal structures. The first compound undergoes topochemical photodimerization, while the second compound is photostable due to reduced orbital overlap.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
