They proposed the term \"piezoeresence\" to describe this reversible phenomenon, where one crystallographic orientation grows out of another under the influence of stress. The study provides insights into the development of twin patterns in quartz and the potential applications in telecommunications and crystallography.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
