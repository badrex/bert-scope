Daniell, constructed a water barometer in the Royal Society's hall to study atmospheric tides, periodic oscillations of the barometer, and vapor tension at different temperatures. The observations, taken from October 1830 to March 1832, showed that the water barometer could detect fluctuations in pressure that would be missed by a mercurial barometer. The author recommends using a deeper layer of oil to protect the water from atmospheric influences in future research.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
