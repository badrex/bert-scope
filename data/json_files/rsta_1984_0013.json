It explores the role of metasomatism of the mantle wedge by fluids from the subducted slab and the involvement of sedimentary materials in the genesis of these magmas. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the various potential magma source components in different oceanic arc systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
