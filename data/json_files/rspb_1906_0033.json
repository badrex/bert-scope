The authors found that an adult can safely experience a total barometric pressure of at least 7 atmospheres, which is higher than previous limits. They also discovered that the limit for safe diving is about 210 feet, which could be extended by diluting the air with nitrogen. The researchers emphasize the importance of proper decompression techniques to prevent accidents and fatalities in caisson works and diving.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography and Marine Biology"}
