The authors analyze the structure and stress differences within the mantle, considering factors such as heat flow, gravity anomalies, and the Earth's bulge. They explore three models of the mantle's mechanical behavior and examine the implications for continental drift and the Earth's internal processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
