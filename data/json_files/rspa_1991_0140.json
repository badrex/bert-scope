The Wiener-Hopf technique is applied to obtain a set of linear simultaneous equations, which can be inverted numerically to calculate the sound scattered by the barrier. An approximate analytic solution is obtained in the low-frequency limit and compared with a numerical example.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Acoustics"}
