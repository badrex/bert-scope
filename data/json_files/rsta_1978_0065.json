The authors analyzed 202 ancient harbor sites in Greece, Turkey, and Cyprus, and made 175 independent estimates of sea level change. The data reveal intermittent seismic movements with varying rates of tilt, leading to the construction of a new subduction zone model and a revised understanding of the Hellenic Arc's formation."}
