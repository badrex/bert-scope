The authors study the formation of directly mutagenic nitroderivatives when exposed to amines and benzo(a)pyrene, which may contribute to the carcinogenicity observed in organic particulates collected from smog and vehicle exhausts. They also investigate the reactions of nitrosamine precursors, such as secondary and tertiary methyl and ethylamines, with nitrous acid in the atmosphere. The environmental and health implications of these reactions are discussed, highlighting the complexity of the mixtures of gaseous and particulate pollutants that impact urban areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
