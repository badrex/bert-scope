The author finds that Haycraft's method often gives higher results, and suggests that this is due to the assumption that the silver precipitate from urine contains only 1 atom of silver in the molecule. The author proposes that the precipitate may contain 2 atoms of silver in a molecule of urate, which would make the results more accurate when divided by two.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
