They found a mixed chemisorption regime where carbon monoxide dissociates and forms a 'carbide-oxide' layer at low coverage, followed by associative molecular binding at higher coverages. Preadsorption of dihydrogen reduces the extent of dissociation of subsequently sorbed carbon monoxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
