They tested materials such as colza oil, olive oil, raw linseed oil, castor oil, ether, bisulfide of carbon, amylene, benzol, toluol, xylol, and cymol. The specific inductive capacity of these materials was found to be different, and the author discussed the results and compared them with previous research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
