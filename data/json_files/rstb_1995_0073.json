They found that signal cost ensures receivers obtain some honest information, but exploitative strategies can still gain short-term benefits. Honesty and cost are prerequisites for the evolution of exploitation, while cost-free signaling leads to a reduction in hidden preferences and potential for exploitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
