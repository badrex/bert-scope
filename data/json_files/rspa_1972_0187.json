They found that additional peaks in the derivative spectrum of sulphur contaminant on a polycrystalline nickel surface were more readily resolved with a cylindrical mirror analyzer. The fine structure was not due to any chemical shift of the sulphur L2,3 level. The authors identified the peaks in the sulphur Auger spectrum as originating in transitions involving electrons in surface molecular orbitals formed by chemisorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
