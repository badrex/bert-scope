They find that the proportion of vapor formed during the flow process is not predictable from equilibrium considerations alone, and that the time required for equilibrium to be attained is crucial. The authors provide a theoretical analysis of the velocity of flow, taking into account the effects of vapor formation on the specific volume and velocity of the fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
