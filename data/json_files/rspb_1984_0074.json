The study focuses on silica deposition in the abaxial epidermis and macrohairs of the lemma at different stages of maturation. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms of silica deposition in grasses and their potential applications in phytoremediation and food safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
