They used a one-dimensional digital computer code that transformed conservation equations into difference equations in Lagrangian form. The method was tested with various materials, and the results showed promising agreement with experimental data, opening the possibility of calculating seismic amplitudes from first principles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Seismology"}
