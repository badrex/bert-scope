They find that the correct form of interaction in these processes is either a space-time parity (STP) combination or a vector-axial (VA) combination. The study provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of beta-decay processes and helps in determining the correct form of interaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
