They describe the haustorial structure and behavior of Loranthus elegans, Tapinanthus prunifolius, and Taxillus glaucus, revealing fundamental differences between them. The study provides insights into the complex relationships between these plants and their hosts, as well as the prevalence of 'runners' in the Loranthoideae subfamily.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
