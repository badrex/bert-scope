They used innovative techniques to determine the melting points of helium under extreme conditions, extending the understanding of its behavior at high pressures and temperatures. Their findings contribute to the study of phase equilibrium and low-temperature physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
