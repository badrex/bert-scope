They develop a mathematical theory for the rates of change of parameters specifying the eccentricity and argument of perigee, providing complete analytical solutions for near-circular orbits. The results are illustrated by numerical examples, highlighting the importance of understanding and accounting for air drag in satellite orbits with low eccentricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aerospace Engineering"}
