They noticed that the lamb's udder had fallen in size, but there were no signs of an hermaphrodite. The author also mentioned the death of another ewe due to over-heating and lying on the ground without its fleece. This study provides insights into sheep reproduction and the impact of environmental factors on their health.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
