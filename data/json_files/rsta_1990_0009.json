Preformed polymers, such as vinyl-maleic anhydride alternating copolymers, are used to create stable and robust films with regular layer structures. These films have been used as submicrometre resists, for second harmonic generation, and electro-optic modulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
