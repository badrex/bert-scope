The study compares Glauconome and Pharella with other members of their respective families and concludes that the Glaucomyidae should be included with the Veneridae and Petricolidae in the Veneracea, rather than with the Solenidae in the Solenacea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Malacology"}
