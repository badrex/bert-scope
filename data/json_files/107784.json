This process is due to the action of animal excrement and other organic substances in the water. The purified water is transparent and odorless but contains a higher amount of earthy and neutral salts, making it a hard water. The author also discovered that the brown color in the purified water is due to the solution of extractive matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Water Quality and Treatment"}
