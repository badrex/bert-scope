The authors introduce a new concept of the leaf/plant mass ratio, which takes into account the contribution of earlier seasons' growth to the perennating system. They also propose the unit production rate as a measure of growth relative to the mass of the perennating structure. This new approach allows for a better understanding of perennial plant growth and can be used to make more pertinent comparisons when interpreting treatment effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Plant Science"}
