They introduced surface operators and showed that with their help, a consistent calculus can be developed. This new approach allows for the calculation of physical quantities relating to different states of the crystal, such as elastic constants and thermal frequencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
