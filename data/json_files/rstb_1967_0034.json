The author defines a series of mollusk assemblage zones and attempts to interpret the ecological and depositional environment in which they accumulated. The findings provide insights into the climate and marine conditions during the Early Pleistocene in East Anglia.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Stratigraphy"}
