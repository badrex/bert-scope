They found that crustacean muscles with low glycogen levels go into rigor mortis more quickly than those with higher glycogen levels. The researchers also discovered that muscles from soft-shelled specimens had a more alkaline reaction than those from hard-shelled specimens. However, they were unable to confirm the statement that glycogen is only present in crustacean muscles during the moulting process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
