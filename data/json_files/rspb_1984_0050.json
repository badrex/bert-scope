Ten species of sharks belonging to three families were recorded, with Carcharhinus melanopterus and Negaprion acutidens being the most abundant in the lagoon. Sharks were tagged and recaptured, revealing restricted movements and slow growth rates. Population densities and reproductive cycles were studied, suggesting that C. melanopterus may be food-limited due to intense intra- and inter-species competition.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Biology"}
