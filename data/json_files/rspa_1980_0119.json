They use a numerical finite-difference method to calculate the flow development between the step and compare the results with the asymptotic theory. The study shows good agreement between the numerical solutions and the theory, especially for Reynolds numbers between 100 and 600.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
