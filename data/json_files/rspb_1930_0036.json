They found that histamine is produced when histidine is exposed to radiation with wavelengths shorter than 290 nm. The absorption spectra of histamine and histidine were also studied, revealing differences in their absorption bands. The results indicate that histamine production from histidine is mainly due to wavelengths shorter than 290 nm, and that histamine is rapidly destroyed by radiation, especially those with shorter wavelengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
