They find that infrared cooling plays a significant role in modifying the tidal behavior and can suppress unreasonable resonances. The study also examines the effects of varying basic temperature profiles and cooling rate distributions on diurnal and semidiurnal components of the atmosphere's daily variation, and estimates a lower bound for the turbopause height."}
