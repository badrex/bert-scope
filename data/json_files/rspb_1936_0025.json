They found that deep-water fishes receive weak illumination and have a predominance of rods in their retinae. The study aimed to find a correlation between the type of visual purple and the histological structure of the retina, but the attempt was not successful. The research provides important insights into the light-sensitive substances in the retina and their role in color perception.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
