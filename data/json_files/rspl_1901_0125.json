They discover that electrons from radioactive substances like actinium and radium can diffuse away in the air and pass through certain materials, while others like polonium have different diffusibility through air. The author also finds that a current of air can carry some radioactive corpuscles, which may have implications for understanding the nature of free electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
