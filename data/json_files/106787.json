He discovered that the process involves the extrication of inflammable air at different stages, which helps in determining the real degree of confidence in the theory of the process. The experiments also confirmed the real extrication of air, which varied in nature at various periods of the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
