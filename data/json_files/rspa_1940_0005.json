They use X-ray methods to study the microperthitic structures and provide detailed information about the crystallographic axes and chemical composition of the specimens. Their findings help to classify lamellar felspar structures and contribute to a better understanding of the formation of felspar minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
