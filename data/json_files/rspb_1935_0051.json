They found that intradermal and subcutaneous injections of oestrone caused changes in feather pigmentation, with the amount of change proportional to the dosage. The results showed individual variations in response to the hormone, and the distribution of the red pigment in the feathers was asymmetric in many cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
