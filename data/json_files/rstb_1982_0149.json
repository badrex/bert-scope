The two transport systems play a role in regulating cell volume and intracellular pH. The anion exchange system is dominant under normal conditions, while the co-transport system is activated under certain circumstances, such as a reduction in cell volume or an increase in intracellular chloride concentration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
