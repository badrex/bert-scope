The comet's light was resolved into three broad bands, which matched the bands of carbon spectrum. This suggests that carbon might be a component of some comets. The author also discussed the implications of these findings on cometary phenomena and the relationship between the orbits of periodical meteors and comets.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Spectroscopy"}
