They propose a theory that explains the observed properties of ice as a result of pressure-induced liquefaction, dispersion, and re-congelation of water. The author also addresses and critiques other theories proposed by Faraday, Tyndall, and Forbes, and provides evidence to support their own theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
