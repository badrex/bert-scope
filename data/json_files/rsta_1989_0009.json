The research finds limited use of statistical methods in both areas, with fast-growth firms using them more than matched firms. Most firms do not lack advice on quality control but believe that statistical methods are not suitable for their needs.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Business and Management"}
