The author infers that large-scale ductile deformation in the Earth's crust is governed by secondary creep, which involves plastic deformation resulting from dislocation motion and diffusion. The article also compares the flow properties of various rocks, such as ice, halite, marble, dolomite, quartzite, and dunite, under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
