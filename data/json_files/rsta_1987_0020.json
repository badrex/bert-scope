The article discusses the various ways wood can be degraded, including the actions of insects, marine borers, bacteria, and fungi. The degradation process is influenced by factors such as wood anatomy, moisture content, and the presence of nutrients. Understanding these factors can help in wood preservation methods and preventing decay in exposed situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Biodegradation and Wood Science"}
