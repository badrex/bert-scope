The research focuses on a heated sphere and explores how the induced fluid flow affects heat transfer due to the fluctuating buoyancy force. The findings suggest that g-jitter can significantly modify the time-averaged heat transfer from the sphere, with implications for materials processing and solidification processes in space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
