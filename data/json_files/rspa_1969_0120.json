This method allows for higher accuracy in energy calculations and has the potential to be applied to a wide range of molecules and reacting systems. The transcorrelated method introduces factors dependent directly on the interelectronic distance, which can improve the accuracy of molecular energy predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
