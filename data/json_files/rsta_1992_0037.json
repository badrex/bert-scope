This alternative method overcomes the drawbacks of conventional nitration methods, such as the use of nitric acid and sulfuric acid mixtures. The article highlights two main nitration systems: in pure nitric acid and in organic solvents. The organic solvent system enables a wider range of nitrations and allows for the generation of polynitrated species without forming acidic by-products, which is an important environmental consideration. The new synthesis routes have applications in the production of precursors for energetic polymers, nitrated derivatives of functionalized pre-polymers, and energetic binders for explosive and propellant compositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
