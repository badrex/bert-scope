The author, William Watson, explains that the lightning struck Richman's electrical apparatus, causing a globe of blue fire to jump towards his forehead. The force of the lightning was collected on the metal rod of the apparatus, which was in contact with filings of metal in a glass vessel. The author also shares his opinion that the tragedy could have been avoided if the apparatus had been properly insulated and touched the floor, allowing the electricity to be easily communicated to the earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
