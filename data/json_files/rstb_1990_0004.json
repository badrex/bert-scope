This protein may play a role in the inaccessibility of methylated CpGs in mammalian nuclei, contributing to gene regulation and chromatin structure. MeCP is distinct from previously identified sequence-specific methylated DNA binding proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epigenetics"}
