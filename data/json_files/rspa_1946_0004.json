They develop a general solution for the transverse displacement and analyze stress couples and shearing forces in various cases, providing numerical results for a spruce plate. The study extends previous work on isotropic materials to aeolotropic plates, offering insights into the behavior of perforated plates under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
