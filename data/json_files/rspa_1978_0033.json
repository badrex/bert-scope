The authors develop a method to directly solve the stress equations of motion for heterogeneous media, allowing them to compute theoretical seismograms for surface displacements due to point loads. They observe a pseudo wave, similar to the one described by Gilbert and Laster, which appears after the refracted wave. The study highlights the importance of understanding inhomogeneous media for applications in seismology and materials science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
