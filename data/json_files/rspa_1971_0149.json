They found that the main products were methane, ethane, ethylene, propane, propylene, isobutane, and neopentane. A detailed mechanism was proposed to account for the observed product distributions and their dependence on pressure and reactant mixture composition. The formation of vibrationally excited species was the predominant primary process. Some rate constant ratios were evaluated, and absolute rate constants for some individual reactions were estimated from the data.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
