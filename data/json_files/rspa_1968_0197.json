They found that the rate constant for the reaction Cl + O2 + M -> CIOO + M was 6.2 + 1.1 x 10^14 mole^-2 ml.2 s^-1. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanisms and help understand the behavior of the CIO radical in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
