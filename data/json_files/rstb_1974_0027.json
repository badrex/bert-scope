The research focuses on the effects of topography, tribal affiliations, and social organization on population distribution and genetic variation. The authors use migration matrix models to analyze the data and explore the relationships between villages, finding that the circular movement pattern and communication system have a significant impact on the genetic structure of the population.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Anthropology"}
