It reviews the UK's policy on radioactive waste disposal and the systems of control in place to ensure public safety. The behavior of artificial radionuclides in freshwater and estuarine systems is analyzed, considering factors such as dilution, partition between water, sediments, and biological materials, and the habits of local populations. The article highlights the importance of critical pathway techniques in evaluating the potential risks and limiting the rate of introduction of radioactive materials to maintain acceptable exposure standards.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry"}
