They developed a method to titrate the surface groups by measuring electrophoretic mobility and applying the Stern equation. The results showed that the number of acidic surface groups on both cell types was independent of the electrolyte concentration in the surrounding solution. This study provides insights into the interaction of cell surfaces with external agents and the electrostatic charge on the cell surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
