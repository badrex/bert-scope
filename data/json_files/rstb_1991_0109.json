The authors analyze morphological, ecological, and behavioral adaptations to understand the shift in diet from early Miocene to the present. They conclude that hominoids are mainly frugivorous, with adaptations for consuming both hard and soft foods, and that early hominids had similar foraging strategies to their ape ancestors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
