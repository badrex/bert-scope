The authors find that pelargonidin derivatives are more common in tropical and subtropical species, while delphinidin derivatives are more common in temperate and alpine plants. They suggest that red-flowered forms have a greater survival value in most tropical plants, possibly due to natural selection favoring these forms in warmer climates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
