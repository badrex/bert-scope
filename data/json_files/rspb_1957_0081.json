The authors explore the possibility of reduced efficiency of the endothelial lining of the gut, allowing potentially harmful organisms to enter the body. They also consider the effect of extreme cooling on gut flora and the possible depression of immunological defense mechanisms. However, they acknowledge the lack of supporting evidence and the rapidity of death in experimental subjects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology and Microbiology"}
