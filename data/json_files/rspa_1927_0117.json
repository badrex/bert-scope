They found that the reaction rate increased abruptly when the molecular ionization potential of 17 volts was reached. The mechanism proposed involved the formation of nitrogen atoms on collision, which then combined with hydrogen atoms to produce ammonia. This research contributed to the understanding of the potential for ammonia synthesis through electron-activated reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Plasma chemistry"}
