By analyzing the mitochondrial 16S rRNA gene, the researchers found that social parasites in Polistine wasps are monophyletic, which means they share a common ancestor. This finding contradicts the hypothesis that social parasites evolved sympatrically from their hosts, suggesting that speciation occurred allopatrically and independently of the evolution of social parasitism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
