They assume constant stress difference and no strain hardening, making fewer assumptions than previous solutions. The study provides values for the stresses and strains in the elastic and plastic zones, contributing to the understanding of stress distribution in thick tubes, particularly in the autofrettaging of gun barrels.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
