The authors propose that these ions accompany negative phosphate ions into the cell and can be incorporated into a structure involving phosphorylated intermediates and enzyme surfaces. This binding helps protect the cell from the action of hydrions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
