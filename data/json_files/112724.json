H. L. Russell, discusses linear differential equations of the second and third orders and their solutions. He presents a method to treat these equations and believes it can be applied to all linear differential equations of every degree. The text includes mathematical formulas and explanations of the equations' properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
