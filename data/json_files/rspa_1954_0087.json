They analyzed three parallel bands and a perpendicular band, providing values for the rotational constants in the ground state. This study offers the first complete analysis of a perpendicular band in a symmetrical top molecule, contributing to the understanding of vibrational interactions in polyatomic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
