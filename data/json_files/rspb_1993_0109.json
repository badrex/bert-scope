The method identifies the sign of the largest Liapunov exponent, indicating the presence or absence of chaos and the possibility of assigning a value to the exponent. This approach can work for short time series of only 500 points and is demonstrated using real and model systems, including chickenpox and measles data from New York City.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
