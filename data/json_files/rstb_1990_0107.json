The research found that 15 species of terrestrial vertebrates have colonized the islands, with two species becoming extinct and five new species establishing breeding populations. The authors discuss the ecological changes that have shaped the development of the current fauna, including canopy closure, volcanic eruptions, and the impact of human activity on dispersal patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
