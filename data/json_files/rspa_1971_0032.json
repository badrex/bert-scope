The study finds that the exchange of propylene, ethylene, but-1-ene, and isobutene occurs through a stepwise mechanism. The rates of exchange vary depending on the type of zeolite and hydrocarbon used, with some catalysts showing increased activity with higher degrees of ion exchange. The results provide insights into the catalytic activity of zeolites and the adsorption processes of hydrocarbon molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
