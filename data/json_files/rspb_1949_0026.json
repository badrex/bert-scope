They found that Ascaris haemoglobin has a high oxygen affinity, which makes it a suitable indicator for oxygen production in photosynthesis. The study also showed that the rate of oxygenation decreases exponentially with time, suggesting that the oxygen output of the photochemical reaction declines over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
