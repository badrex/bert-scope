The authors classify caustics into two categories (R and S) and provide examples of each in the context of deep water waves on currents. They also discuss the role of Airy functions in linear theory and how they are replaced by Painleve transcendents in nonlinear cases. The study has implications for understanding wave behavior near caustics and the analysis of higher-order ray singularities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
