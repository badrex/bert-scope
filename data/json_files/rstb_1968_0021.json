The fauna includes two extinct and 33 now rare species, mostly found in Arctic or sub-Arctic regions. The insect assemblage suggests an open treeless habitat similar to present-day northern tundras. The study provides insights into the local environment and climate, indicating more severe conditions than other entomologically investigated sites. This research also suggests that fossil insect assemblages can be valuable for correlating Quaternary deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
