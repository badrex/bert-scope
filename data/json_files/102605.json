These mice march in innumerable multitudes, causing damage to meadows and consuming grass roots and rotten wood as their main food source. They are also reported to be very fertile, giving birth to eight or nine at a time. The arrival of these creatures is believed to bring great plenty of game, such as fowl, squirrels, and foxes, as they were seen to do in the past.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammals"}
