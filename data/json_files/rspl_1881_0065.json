The authors conducted over 900 experiments using thermo-electric apparatus and found that bone is the best conductor of heat, followed by brain tissue and then skin. The results provide insights into the differences in conductivity among these tissues and their implications for understanding heat transfer in living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
