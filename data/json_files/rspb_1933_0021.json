The research shows that salts affect one another's absorption by living cells, a phenomenon known as antagonism. The findings suggest that the intake of ions varies depending on their valency and concentration, and that the \"Colloid Precipitation Theory\" may explain this phenomenon. Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms behind antagonism and ion absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
