They discovered that liver cells have a network-like structure with granules and fat globules. The cells' appearance and function change depending on the animal's nutritional state and temperature, which affects the storage and use of granules and glycogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
