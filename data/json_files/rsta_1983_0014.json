The study focused on the structure of the marine boundary layer, cloud dynamics, and the interaction between the boundary layer and larger-scale atmospheric flow. The findings highlighted the importance of boundary layer cloud and the need for further observations to improve models.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Climatology"}
