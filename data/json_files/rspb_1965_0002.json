They find that the content of organic carbon in the sediments is mainly affected by the rate of mineral erosion from the surrounding land surface, rather than variations in organic productivity. The study provides insights into the environmental changes and human activities that have shaped the Lake District lakes over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Sedimentology and Paleolimnology"}
