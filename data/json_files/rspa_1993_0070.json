They use a kernel function and a general expansion technique to obtain a solution that depends continuously on the initial conditions and converges to the expected solution as time progresses. This approach provides a natural solution to the Cauchy problem even when the initial condition is a distribution with compact support.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
