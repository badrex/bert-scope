Genetic manipulation, including the transfer of nif genes, can improve competitiveness, hydrogenase, and fixation period. New systems can be created through somatic hybridization or transferring nif genes to mycorrhiza. The article also reviews progress in understanding nif genes in Klebsiella pneumoniae and their potential for manipulation in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Science"}
