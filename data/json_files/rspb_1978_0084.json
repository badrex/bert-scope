It shows that kainic acid blocks synaptic transmission by interacting with the postsynaptic receptors, which are normally activated by the transmitter. This results in a diminished effect of the transmitter released by a presynaptic nerve impulse.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
