W. Herschel observed a luminous appearance in the sky, stretching across several stars. The phenomenon appeared as a bright white band, which he believed to be the tail of a comet. The band remained fixed among the stars, leading Herschel to conclude that it was not a cloud illuminated by the sun. He encouraged other meteorologists to observe and report similar phenomena to better understand this celestial event.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational astronomy"}
