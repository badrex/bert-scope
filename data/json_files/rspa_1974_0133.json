This model is described in detail and experimental evidence is analyzed to demonstrate its physical realism and potential applications. The model offers an alternative approach to traditional concepts of turbulent mixing and shear stresses, providing a foundation for further theoretical work and numerical solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
