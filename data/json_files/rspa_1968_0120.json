The theory accounts for various phenomena, such as the anomalous magnetic moments of nucleons, the ratio of Gamow-Teller and Fermi decay coupling constants, and the nuclear force. The author also discusses the connection between electromagnetism and weak interactions and the role of vector meson fields in these interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
