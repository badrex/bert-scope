The author also discusses the potential use of these tables for ship navigation and safety. The article also mentions an upcoming tide observation engine proposed by Dr. Christopher Wren that could automate some of these measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
