The author introduces a new notation and proves that the component angular momentum of the ellipsoid about any diameter parallel to the rough plane is equal to p, multiplied into the component velocity of the point of contact in the direction at right angles to this diameter. The results are then reduced into a simplified form.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mechanics"}
