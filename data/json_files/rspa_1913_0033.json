This method is useful in practical engineering work and can help determine the stiffness and deflections for a given load. The author also discusses the effects of corrections on the period of structures and shares a real-life example of using this method to determine the flexure of a vertical column under lateral force.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
