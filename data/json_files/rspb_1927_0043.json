The study found that the ultra-violet rays come mostly from the sky and that sunlight in England has rays of shorter wavelengths than X 4200. The research also showed a correspondence between the fading of acetone-blue and the erythema-producing power of the sun's rays, indicating that exposure to the summer sun can produce well-marked erythema.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
