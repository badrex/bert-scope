They classify the various actions observed and quantify the work involved in each. The study focuses on the forces at play during the cutting process, including friction, internal friction, and elastic and permanent distortion. The author also discusses the design of cutting tools and the factors that affect their efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metalworking"}
