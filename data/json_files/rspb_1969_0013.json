Adrenaline was found to increase the membrane's permeability to potassium and chloride ions, leading to hyperpolarization and a reduction in membrane resistance. This research provides insight into the complex mechanisms underlying the action of adrenaline on smooth muscle cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Smooth Muscle Physiology"}
