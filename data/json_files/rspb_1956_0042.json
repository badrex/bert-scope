Morphism provides natural markers that can reveal information about the selective factors at work in a population, such as changes in morph-frequency over time or in response to environmental factors. The author presents various examples from different species, including insects, birds, and mammals, to illustrate the potential of morphism in understanding population dynamics and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
