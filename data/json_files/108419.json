They analyze the work of previous researchers and present their own observations and conclusions on the composition and growth of these scales. The author finds that both M. Mandl and M. Agassiz have made errors in their interpretations of the structure and growth of fish scales, and provides a more accurate understanding of the composition and development of these scales.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
