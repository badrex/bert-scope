They explore a cosmological model described by an \"atomic\" metric and discuss the differences between Dirac's Einstein-de Sitter model and standard relativistic cosmology. The study highlights the implications of the hypothesis and its potential testable predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
