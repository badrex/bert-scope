They discovered the submerged part of the Isle of Purbeck Anticline, an elongated dome with Corallian rocks exposed at Lulworth Bank, and the Shambles Syncline, a broad and gentle syncline in Jurassic and Lower Cretaceous rocks. The study provides valuable information about the seafloor's geology and structure, contributing to the understanding of the region's geological history.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
