It focuses on the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation and its relation to the Grassmannian formalism. The author demonstrates that these three methods are equivalent and discusses the role of loop groups in soliton theory. The article also introduces the dressing action for the modified KdV (mKdV) equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
