They used electron microscopy and bismuth nitrate staining to visualize the complex and its components. The study found that the proteinpolysaccharide complex is bound to collagen in the cartilage, and that it consists of networks of chondroitin sulfate chains cross-linked by bismuth ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Anatomy"}
