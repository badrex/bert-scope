They found that the processes involved in exercise, such as oxygen intake, oxygen debt, and recovery, were similar in diabetics and normal individuals. The production and removal of lactic acid during and after exercise were also found to be the same in both groups. The study confirmed that insulin was not necessary for the formation of lactic acid from glycogen during exercise in diabetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
