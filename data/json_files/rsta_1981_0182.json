These fronts are characterized by high standing crops of phytoplankton and act as biogeographic boundaries between water masses with distinct plankton communities. The article examines the physical factors that affect these fronts and their impact on biological productivity in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
