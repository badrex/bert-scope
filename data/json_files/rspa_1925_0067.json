They found that the fraction of rays transmitted, absorbed, or reflected by a given thickness of matter varies with the velocity of the rays. The authors also discovered that scattering plays a significant role in the behavior of the absorbed and transmitted fractions when the velocity is changed. Their experimental methods can be used to measure changes in these fractions when the velocity varies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
