The authors found that the catalytic constant for anion catalysts varies with temperature, while the Arrhenius factor A remains nearly constant. The results provide insights into the theoretical basis of the Bronsted equation and the factors affecting reaction velocities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and catalysis"}
