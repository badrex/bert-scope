They propose a mechanism involving micelles, latex particle formation, and polymerization within individual particles. The authors also discuss the role of monomer diffusion, the Smith-Ewart relation, and the impact of additives on the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
