The sea rose to a height of six feet and remained agitated for half an hour, flooding the quay and causing several vessels to break loose from their moorings. This phenomenon happened again on November 1, 1755, with similar results. The event is likely related to a combination of tides and storm surges.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
