They observed that the ciliated arms, initially thought to be branchiae, are used for prehension and auxiliary natation. The respiratory siphon is a process of the mantle, and the author discovered six arms in a single genus. The animals exhibit sensitivity and rapid movements, using their complex foot for defense and locomotion. The paper includes descriptions of various species and their shells, as well as illustrations of the objects discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
