They identify four 'flooding' conditions for trapezoidal-section fins and determine the positions around a tube at which these occur. The study suggests that maximum heat-transfer enhancement occurs when the spacing between fins maximizes the 'unblanked' finned tube surface area. The use of a radiused fillet at the fin root is also found to increase the 'unblanked' or 'active' area, potentially leading to improved heat-transfer enhancement during condensation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
