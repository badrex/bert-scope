They found that the reaction rates were independent of temperature and equal to about 1/20 of the bimolecular collision frequency. This study provides valuable data for understanding the kinetics of individual steps in the chain reaction between hydrogen and oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
