They found that the electron emission can arise from thermal agitation alone, but it can be aided or hindered in various ways. The authors also investigated the methods used to produce neon and helium in vacuum tubes and discussed the importance of excluding air from the apparatus to avoid interference.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
