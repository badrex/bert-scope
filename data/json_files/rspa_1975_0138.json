The experiments were conducted using optically smooth rubber spheres and a hard flat surface of Perspex, which was roughened to varying degrees. The results show that surface roughness can significantly reduce adhesion, especially for rubbers with higher moduli. A theoretical analysis based on the contact theory of Johnson, Kendall, and Roberts is developed to explain the observed behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
