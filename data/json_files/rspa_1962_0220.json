They describe the theoretical basis for these experiments and their potential to provide more accurate measurements of the ether drift and the velocity of light. The authors also mention the importance of these tests in verifying the principle of relativity and the far-reaching consequences of its consequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity"}
