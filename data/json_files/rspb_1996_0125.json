It explains how the heritability of fluctuating asymmetry is often underestimated due to sampling errors and measurement errors. The author provides a method to correct these biases and suggests more accurate measures of genetic properties of canalization. The article also highlights the low correlation among characters of fluctuating asymmetry in the same individuals, which is inconsistent with the mechanisms proposed for the development of canalization."}
