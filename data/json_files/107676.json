They explore various methods of calculating these expansions and discuss the differences between explicit functions of three rectangular coordinates and other cases. The author also examines the work of other mathematicians and their contributions to the understanding of spheroid geometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
