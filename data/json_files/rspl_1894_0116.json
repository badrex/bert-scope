The author examines the skeletal remains and compares them to known reptile types, noting similarities to Theriodonts and Dicynodonts. The findings suggest that these remains may belong to a distinct group separate from Cynodontia and Gomphodontia.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
