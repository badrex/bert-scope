The study focuses on the molecular mass and spectral properties of phytochrome, as well as the phototransformation pathways from Pr to Pfr and vice versa. The research also highlights the importance of chromophore domain size and its impact on phytochrome's functionality.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
