The authors describe the various types of sedimentary rocks deposited in the basin and how they relate to the different geodynamical processes that have taken place. They also provide an overview of the tectonic and lithostratigraphical framework of the North Sea, highlighting the relationship between subsidence and the types of sedimentary rocks deposited in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
