The author, John Allan Broun, observed the range of the lunar diurnal variation and found that it follows a similar \"decennial\" law as the solar diurnal variation. He also discovered a lunar-diurnal law of disturbance with a principal maximum 5 hours before the moon passes the upper meridian. The study was conducted at the Trevandrum Observatory, and the results suggest that the mean lunar disturbance obeys the same law as the mean solar disturbance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
