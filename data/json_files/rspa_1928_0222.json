The authors calculate the emission and reflexion coefficients for electrons at the metal surface and integrate over all incident electrons. They find that the emission coefficient for thermions becomes nearly equal to 1, and the average reflexion amounts to a few percent. The authors also discuss the influence of external fields on electron emission and reflexion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
