The reaction is self-inhibited and sensitive to the surface-volume ratio of the reaction vessel. The mechanism involves the abstraction of hydrogen atoms from product isobutene, generating resonance-stabilized radicals that terminate the chain reaction. The authors also discovered that heterogeneous processes play an important role in the overall reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
