The tendrils appear to act as damped springs that attach the capsule to seaweed. The tendrils' structure consists of concentric lamellae of collagen-containing fibrils, with fine fluid-filled canals and polymer granules. The tendril-forming region in the nidamental gland is responsible for the tendril's complex three-dimensional organization. The study provides insights into the self-assembly of complex collagen structures and their adaptive properties, with potential implications for embryological development, pathology, and technology applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Chordate Reproduction"}
