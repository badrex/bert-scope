They discover that a dominant white color pattern in rabbits is due to the presence of an anti-tyrosinase or inhibitor in the skin, while the recessive white variety is caused by the lack of one or both of the oxidase and chromogen components of the pigment-producing system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
