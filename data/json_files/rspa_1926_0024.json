They found that a small compression is set up immediately after the crystal touches the surface, and this compression remains constant for some time before the spread film reaches the density of the expanded film. The rate of spreading from the crystal is constant during this time. The authors also discuss the structure of quartz and the determination of its crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
