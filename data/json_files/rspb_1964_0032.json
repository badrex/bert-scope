The hybrids display a greater adult size, more rapid growth, and superior canalization of growth compared to the inbred strains. The results show that the hybrids' luxuriance is most evident in constant heat, while the inbreds tend to disperse their growth rate more rapidly in other environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
