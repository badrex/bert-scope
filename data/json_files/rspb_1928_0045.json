They discovered that during a tendon jerk, there is a period of absence of action-currents, which they called the \"silent period.\" This period is essential for understanding the relationship between inhibition and reflexes in muscle contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
