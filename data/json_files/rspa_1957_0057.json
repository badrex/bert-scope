They observed the energy dependence of the cross-section, which was consistent with the W.K.B. treatment of Alder and Winther. The absolute cross-section was found to be about three times the theoretical value, leading to two possible explanations for the discrepancy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
