The cause of the inflammation was unknown, but it is believed that it could have been caused by a foreign object, such as a small bone or a hard piece of food, that injured the gut and led to the growth of the disease. The autopsy also showed that the heart and lungs were not essentially diseased, but there were signs of a slight inflammation affecting the membranes around the thorax.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Pathology"}
