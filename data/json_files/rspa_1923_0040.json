B. Jeffery's hypothesis on the motion of ellipsoidal particles in a viscous fluid. The experiments show that particles take up specific orientations in relation to the fluid's motion, as predicted by the hypothesis. The results support the idea that ellipsoidal particles adjust their positions over time, with prolate spheroids aligning their long axis perpendicular to the plane of fluid motion and oblate spheroids rotating about an equatorial diameter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
