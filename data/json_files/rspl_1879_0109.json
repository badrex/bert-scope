The author, Samuel Haughton, found that there is a specific time of lift at which the maximum work is done, and this time varies with the weight being lifted. The results suggest that the cubic equation derived from the law of fatigue represents the relationship between these factors, with the time of lift increasing with the weight but not proportionally.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
