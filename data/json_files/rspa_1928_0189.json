They discovered that the mobility of negative ions is independent of age, while the mobility of positive ions is highly variable and influenced by uncontrolled factors, such as the presence of trace substances on the electrodes or walls of the apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
