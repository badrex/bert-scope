Marconi, conducted experiments to explore methods for confining the radiation of electric waves to certain directions and restricting the receptivity of a receiver to electric waves emanating from specific directions. He discovered that horizontal conductors can be used as radiators or absorbers in wireless telegraph stations, allowing for directional transmission and reception. This research contributed to the development of wireless communication technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
