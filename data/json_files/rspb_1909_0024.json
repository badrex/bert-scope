The researchers found that a combination of Pseudomonas and Azotobacter significantly increased the ability of plants to absorb free nitrogen. They tested this finding on oats, barley, hyacinths, and parsnips, observing increased growth and yield in treated plants. The presence of carbonate of lime in the soil was found to be necessary for the bacteria to effectively fix nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Soil Science and Agriculture"}
