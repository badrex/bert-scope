The researchers found that migratory activity has a significant additive genetic component, suggesting that genetic factors play a role in controlling bird migration. The high amount of phenotypic and genetic variation found for migratory activity in this population could lead to rapid evolutionary changes in migratory habits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
