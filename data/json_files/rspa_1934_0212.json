They found that the expansion of charcoal provides a measure of the lowering of surface energy. The results showed that the relations between the percentage linear expansion and adsorption values approximate to the Schofield-Rideal equation of state. The authors also investigated the molecular expansion curves of the alcohols and found that the influence of intermolecular forces determines the distribution of molecules in the films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
