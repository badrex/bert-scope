By adjusting the fixed point and using materials with different expansion rates, the pendulum maintains a more consistent length despite fluctuations in heat. This discovery could improve the accuracy of clocks and other instruments that rely on pendulums.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
