This suggests that molten globule intermediates in protein folding maintain an approximate native structure while allowing minor rearrangements, reducing the conformational space to be searched by the polypeptide chain and preventing global misfoldings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure and Function"}
