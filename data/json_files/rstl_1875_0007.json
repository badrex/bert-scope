The extinct tortoises from the Mascarene islands had a flat cranium, truncated beak, and broad bridge between the obturator foramina, while the recent examples from the Galapagos islands had a convex cranium, trenchant beak, and narrow bridge between the obturator foramina. The author also discusses the historical evidence of the discovery of these tortoises and their eventual extinction due to human activity and the introduction of pigs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
