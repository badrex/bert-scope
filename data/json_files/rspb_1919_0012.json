By using a specific chemical treatment, they were able to make these growth-rings visible and count them to determine the daily growth of cotton plants. This discovery helps to understand the physical properties of cotton hairs and their growth patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
