The ship sank due to large, low, and carelessly open hawse-holes, which allowed water to flood the ship quickly. Whidbey used a combination of a large Dutch vessel and four lighters to lift the sunken frigate and bring it back to harbor. The article highlights the importance of understanding the principles of cohesion in such salvage operations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval engineering"}
