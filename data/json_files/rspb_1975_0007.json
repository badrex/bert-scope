They discovered two types of photoreceptors: pigmented rhabdomeric photoreceptors and a median unpigmented rhabdomeric photoreceptor. The cercariae are photopositive and respond to light and shadow, suggesting that the paired dorsal photoreceptors may be sensitive to light of higher intensity, while the median more ventral photoreceptor may be sensitive to light of lower intensity and shadow.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
