They found that the Late-glacial/Post-glacial boundary was around 8300 BC and the Sub-boreal/Sub-atlantic boundary was about 3000 BC. This evidence supports the synchronization of major zones on both sides of the North Sea and demonstrates the effectiveness of radiocarbon dating in solving Quaternary historical problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoecology"}
