These similarities suggest a close relationship between the two animals, supporting the classification of Limulus as an Arachnid. The author also discusses the suppression of abdominal segmentation in both animals and their shared fossil forms, Eurypterina.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
