It reviews theoretical studies and emphasizes predictions based on observable parameters such as population size, chromosome lengths, and the increment in variance from new mutations. The article also explores the impact of linkage disequilibrium on genetic variance and the consequences of selection in finite populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
