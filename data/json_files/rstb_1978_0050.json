They describe the physical environment, morphology, and biota of these reefs, providing valuable insights into the complex structure and evolution of the Great Barrier Reef. The study includes detailed descriptions of the ribbon reefs' physiographic features, bathymetry, and dominant species, as well as the methods used for data collection and analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
