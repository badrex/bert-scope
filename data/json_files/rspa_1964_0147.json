They criticize existing theories and propose a more concrete and homologous theory to the crystalline solid, without the assumption of long-range order or special groups. The author also discusses the limitations of current theories and the importance of using Ockham's razor in developing a new theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
