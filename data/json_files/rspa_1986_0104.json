The authors analyze the evolution of void size, shape, and orientation in both two-dimensional and three-dimensional cases. They also study the behavior of a cylindrical void in an incompressible, nonlinearly viscous solid and provide approximate formulas for the dilatation rate of a circular void and the void potential. The findings contribute to the development of constitutive relations for porous metals and provide insight into ductile failure mechanisms in solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanics of Materials"}
