The results show that the action of glycine is highly pressure-sensitive, while the action of kainate remains unaffected. These findings suggest that high pressure may block the action of glycine by directly affecting the receptor-ion channel complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuropharmacology"}
