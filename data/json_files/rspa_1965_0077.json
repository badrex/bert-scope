This technique was employed to detect nuclear spin temperatures in sodium metal, confirming the conclusions of previous studies on nuclear cooling. The study also measured spin-lattice relaxation times in copper and platinum metals, providing insights into the behavior of these materials at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
