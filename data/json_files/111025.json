This animalcule has unique features, such as the absence of digestive organs and a different mechanism for circulation and respiration compared to insects. The author also suggests that further study of the Rotifera order is necessary to understand the disposition of sexes and their place in the animal kingdom.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
