They suggest that two harmonic components of the turbulent velocity spectrum can generate these waves through nonlinear interactions. Numerical calculations based on this model show that Tollmien-Schlichting waves can be generated with amplitudes similar to the disturbance amplitude in the free stream, at least for certain ranges of Reynolds number, wavenumber, and frequency.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
