The research found that chronic low doses of radiation can induce recessive lethal mutations, which can be detected by observing the size of litters produced by irradiated mice. The results provide insights into the potential genetic effects of radiation exposure on humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
