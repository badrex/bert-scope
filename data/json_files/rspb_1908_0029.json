They found that phosphates play a crucial role in the fermentation process, as they are converted into a hexosephosphate during the initial period of fermentation. This hexosephosphate is then slowly hydrolyzed, releasing phosphates that can participate in the fermentation process again, leading to an increased fermentation rate. The authors suggest that the entire fermentation process may be due to this cycle of phosphate reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
