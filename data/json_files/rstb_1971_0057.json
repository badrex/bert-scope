It focuses on chromogranin A, dopamine \u03b2-hydroxylase, and the secretion process. The authors provide insights into the storage vesicles, proteins, and enzymes involved in the release of catecholamines in response to neural stimulation, offering a model for neurotransmitter release at synapses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
