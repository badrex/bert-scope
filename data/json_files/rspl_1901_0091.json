The author re-examines M. Poincar\u00e9's work on the subject and derives expressions for the coefficients of stability using ellipsoidal harmonic analysis. The critical Jacobian ellipsoid is found to have axes proportional to 0.65066, 0.81498, and 1.88583, and the author discusses the challenges of obtaining absolute proof of stability through higher approximations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
