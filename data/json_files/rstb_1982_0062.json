It highlights the importance of factors such as the nature of the photosynthetic apparatus, light quantity and quality, and the ability to adapt to different environments. The article also emphasizes the role of interfaces in the colonization of specialized neuston and benthic organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Aquatic Ecosystems"}
