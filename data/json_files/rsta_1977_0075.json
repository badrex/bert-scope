It outlines the physical and chemical processes that occur in the regolith, such as sputtering, and how these processes can be used to understand the Moon's history and the history of other objects in the solar system. The article also explores the role of agglutination in reducing the albedo of the lunar surface and the potential for using magnetic properties of the regolith to study exposure age stratigraphy.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Lunar Geology"}
