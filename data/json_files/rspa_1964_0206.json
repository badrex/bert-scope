They explore ideal strengths and practical strengths, considering the role of microstructures and stress concentrations. The authors propose using refractory crystals and amorphous solids for high strength materials, and emphasize the importance of toughness in practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Strength of Materials"}
