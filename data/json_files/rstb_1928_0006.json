The research focuses on understanding the evolution of the vertebral column and the differentiation of somites into dermato-myotomes and sclerotomes. The findings contribute to the understanding of the development of the membranous and cartilaginous components of vertebrae in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Development"}
