They determined new values for the refraction and dispersion of sulphur dioxide and sulphuretted hydrogen, and measured the refraction and dispersion of carbon oxysulphide for the first time. The study focused on reducing errors in previous measurements and improving the accuracy of the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
