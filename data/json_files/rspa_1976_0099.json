They identify various tectonic trends and discuss the different units, including the Eburnian age events, the northeast trending fold belt, and the Pan African age Mozambique belt. The study provides a better understanding of the region's geological history and structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
