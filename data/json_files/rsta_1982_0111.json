SWOPS is a self-contained, itinerant vessel that can produce and store oil from exploration wells and transport it to shore terminals. The system includes a subsea well, a rigid riser system, and a dynamically positioned tanker with integral process equipment and storage facilities. The design focuses on maintaining production in severe weather conditions and minimizing downtime, making it suitable for small, well-defined oil accumulations that may not be economically viable with conventional methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Offshore Oil Production"}
