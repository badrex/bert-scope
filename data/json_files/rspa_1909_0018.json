They found that the mobility of ions generally varied inversely with pressure and that there was no direct relation between mobilities and molecular weights. The results were explained using the kinetic theory of gases, suggesting that ions consist of a single gas molecule with an associated charge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism and Plasma Physics"}
