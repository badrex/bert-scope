Researchers found that breeding conditions are attained latest in the most southerly station and are retained latest in the most northerly station. The study also reveals a correlation between the hours of sunshine and reproduction, with mice breeding in months with more than about 100 hours of sunshine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammalogy"}
