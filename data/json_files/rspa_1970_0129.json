They discovered that the steady-state barrier-layer thickness, cell diameter, and pore diameter are directly proportional to the formation voltage. The mechanism of film formation involves an equilibrium between oxide formation in the barrier layer and field-assisted dissolution at the bases, determining the cell and pore sizes through a simple geometrical mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Surface Engineering"}
