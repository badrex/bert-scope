It explores the relationship between local abundance and the size of a species' geographic range, as well as the influence of body size, trophic position, and phylogenetic constraints on range sizes and abundance. The author also highlights the importance of understanding these factors to better protect and conserve species at risk of extinction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
