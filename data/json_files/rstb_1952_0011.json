It found that fat is the primary source of energy for locusts during flight, with an average of 80-85% of the total energy expenditure coming from fats or fatty acids. The metabolic rate increases with the square of the flying speed, and the endurance of flight is proportional to the amount of fat stored before the start. The study also discusses the importance of sufficient food intake for migrating swarms and the efficiency of fat as a fuel in insect muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
