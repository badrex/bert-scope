They found that the gold surface becomes negatively electrified during the process, and the electrical effect is due to occluded gas leaving the metal. The authors also observed that the temperature plays a significant role in the electrical charge and the rate of gas absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
