They present evidence for a series of small gene conversions in the human foetal globin gene pair and suggest that gene conversions may be the consequence of a general mechanism that enables chromosomes to find their homologues during meiosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
