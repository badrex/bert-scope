They demonstrate the passage of carbohydrates in the opposite direction, converting glucose into a body with the same cupric oxide reducing power as maltose, and cane-sugar into maltose, rather than glucose. This research also shows the presence of ferments in the alimentary canal, circulatory system, and liver that play a role in these transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
