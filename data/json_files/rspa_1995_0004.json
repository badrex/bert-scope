The author uses a series method to solve the problem and calculates the stress intensity factor and radial stress on the surface of the cavity for various parameters. The findings can be applied to shrink fitting and fiber-reinforced composites.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
