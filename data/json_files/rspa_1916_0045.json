The authors study the effects of temperature and vapour-pressure on the relative intensities of specific lines in the spectrum. They also explore the absorption bands produced by passing white light through non-luminous mercury vapour. The findings contribute to the understanding of atomic physics and spectroscopy, particularly in the context of mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
