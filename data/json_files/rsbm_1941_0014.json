His early work in zoology and marine biology led him to study the evolution of human society and the importance of preserving traditional cultures. Haddon's expeditions, such as the one to the Torres Straits, allowed him to collect valuable data on the thoughts, customs, and languages of indigenous peoples, which he used to better understand the evolution of human society and the impact of modernization on traditional ways of life.", "scientific_discipline": "Anthropology > Cultural Anthropology"}
