He discusses the expansion of quicksilver in barometer tubes and the impact of temperature on the measurements. Roy also compares his findings with those of Mr. De Luc and presents his own method for calculating altitude based on the barometer readings and temperature adjustments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
