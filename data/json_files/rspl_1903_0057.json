They find that the poison primarily affects the respiratory system, causing paralysis of the respiratory center and leading to convulsions and failure of the circulation. The poison does not have a direct paralyzing effect on the heart, and its impact on the nervous system is limited to the paralysis of muscle end-plates, similar to curara. The study provides insights into the physiological action of hydrophid poison and its potential implications for snakebite victims.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
