He studied under Justus Liebig in Germany and conducted research on natural colorants and products. Schunck's work on colorants from aloes and lichens led to the discovery of new compounds and contributed to the understanding of anthraquinone derivatives. His research played a significant role in the field of natural-product chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
