He used a photometer to compare the light from different sources and found that the intensity of light diminished in a ratio less than the squares of the distances. The author concluded that the resistance of air to light was negligible and suggested further experiments to measure the resistance more accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
