The author estimates the magnitudes of three factors in the exchange: momentary currents due to lightning discharges, convection currents carried by rain, and continuous currents carried by ions moving in powerful electric fields below the cloud. The results show that point discharge from trees plays a significant role in the upward current, contributing to the Earth's negative charge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Electricity"}
