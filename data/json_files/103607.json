He determined the longitude of Port Royal in Jamaica based on the eclipse observations. The eclipse began at 12:59:55 and ended around 15:27 minutes. This observation helped improve the accuracy of timekeeping and astronomical measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Lunar Observations"}
