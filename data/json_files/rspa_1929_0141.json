The authors discovered that iodine monochloride and iodine trichloride are stable in dilute carbon tetrachloride solutions, while bromine trichloride does not exist at the used dilutions. The study provides evidence for the existence of bromine chloride and contributes to the understanding of inter-halogen compound behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Halogen chemistry"}
