It explains that resistance in shallow water is initially higher than in deep water, but as the speed increases, resistance in shallow water becomes lower. The study provides graphs and calculations to demonstrate the impact of shallow water on wave-making speed and resistance, which can be useful for improving ship design and performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
