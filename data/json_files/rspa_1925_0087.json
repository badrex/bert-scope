The researchers found that peripheral stimulation with white light can significantly reduce the contrast perception at the fovea when the brightness of the central matching field is approximately equal to that of the surround. The study also explores the effects of varying the wavelength of monochromatic light and the intensity of the surround while keeping the central field's intensity constant.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Vision Science"}
