The authors derive expressions for the electronic contributions to the force-constant tensors in real space and show that the effective nuclear potential has a simple two-body form for a Bravais lattice. The results are applicable to the Hartree-Fock approximation and demonstrate translational invariance to all orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
