The authors use the double torsion method to evaluate the stress intensity factor for cracks propagating in a controlled manner. They find that cracks predominantly propagate through the cobalt matrix and develop a theory of fracture based on experimental data and quantitative analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
