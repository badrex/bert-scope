The author uses mathematical investigations and calculations to determine the distribution of stresses in the Earth's mass and the strength of materials needed to withstand these forces. The study concludes that the Earth's materials must be strong enough to bear the stress caused by the uneven distribution of land and sea, and that the strength of materials increases closer to the Earth's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
