They explore the different types of persulphuric acids, including pertetrasulphuric acid, peranhydrosulphuric acid (Caro's acid), and others. The author also examines the relationship between these acids and the periodic table, as well as their potential applications in various chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
