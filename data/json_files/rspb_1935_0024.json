They discovered that hypophysectomized birds experience significant changes in their plumage, such as increased fringing and loss of pigmentation, which can be corrected by administering thyroxine. This suggests that thyroid atrophy, known to occur in mammals after hypophysectomy, also occurs in birds and plays a crucial role in post-hypophysectomy plumage changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
