The authors explain the formation of these miogeanticlines as part of the Plio-Quaternary phase of the southwards outgrowth of the Hellenic, Calabrian, and Cyprus Arc Systems. The study provides insights into the early evolutionary stages of dominantly compressional submarine mountain ranges before they are subject to subaerial erosion or modification by later tectonism.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
