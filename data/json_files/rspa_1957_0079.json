They find that discontinuities in the stress-strain curve are caused by localized temperature rises during deformation. The calculated magnitudes of load drops and transition temperatures agree well with experimental observations. The study suggests that all metals should exhibit unstable deformation at sufficiently low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Plasticity"}
