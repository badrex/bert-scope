The authors found that the natural oxide layer on most metals provides protection against metallic contact at small loads, and the degree of protection depends on factors like surface roughness, oxide film thickness, and the relative hardness of the oxide and metal. The friction and electrical resistance between sliding surfaces were measured, revealing that sliding occurs primarily within the oxide layers for some metals, while for others, the oxide film breaks down, leading to metallic contact. The authors also found that the friction is generally lower for harder metals, and they suggest that this is due to the reduced disruption of oxide films and less plastic deformation at contact points."}
