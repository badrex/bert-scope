They analyze tide data from Plymouth and Bristol and find that a regular form and good approximation for the semimenstrual inequality can be obtained from one year's observations. The lunar parallax corrections can be determined from a series of three to four years, while the lunar declination corrections require a series of four to five years for a general form and approximate value.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
