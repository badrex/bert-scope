It proves that the chemical potential has the same value throughout a multi-phase system in equilibrium and demonstrates how it can be used to determine the conditions for equilibrium between and within phases. The findings have implications for understanding stress in solids at chemical equilibrium with fluids and can be applied to various fields, including geophysics and metallurgy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
