They focus on the work of Dr. Eggen, who investigates moving star groups and open clusters, such as the Hyades, to study the evolution of stars. The author also mentions the Groombridge 1830 group of high-velocity stars and the importance of parallax in determining the distances and absolute magnitudes of stars."}
