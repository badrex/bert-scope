The research shows that the animal has typical freshwater adaptations and no special features related to its Antarctic environment. The findings contribute to our understanding of the unique Antarctic ecosystem and the survival strategies of its inhabitants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
