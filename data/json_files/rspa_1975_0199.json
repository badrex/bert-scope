The authors obtain critical constants for the onset of cellular convection by solving the differential eigenvalue system using both an initial value and a variational technique for an extensive range of Taylor and Chandrasekhar number values. The theoretical values are presented mainly in diagrammatical form and are compared with experimental results of Nakagawa at the corresponding parameter values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
