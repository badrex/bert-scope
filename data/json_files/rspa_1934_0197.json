They successfully collected and analyzed the separated isotopes, observing different transformations and properties for each isotope when bombarded with protons or deuterons. This research contributed to the understanding of nuclear structure and the behavior of isotopes under bombardment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
