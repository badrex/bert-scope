The phenomenon could not be attributed to common electrical repulsion or heat, and it appeared to be a novel kind of effect. The author also mentioned that the phenomenon could not be explained by the idea of electro-magnetic results being produced by the transition currents or motions of a single imponderable fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
