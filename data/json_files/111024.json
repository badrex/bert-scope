He introduces an ellipsoid, whose axes are directly proportional to the moments of inertia of the body, to represent the motion. The paper presents a method of investigation that provides a simple and elegant interpretation of integrals needed to determine the dynamic state of a body at any given time.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
