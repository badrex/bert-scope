Mendel's focus on unit hereditary genes allowed for the analysis of complex entities into their ultimate constituents, leading to significant advancements in genetics. However, the author argues that development has been left out of consideration in these advancements and calls for a more comprehensive approach that includes the processes of development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
