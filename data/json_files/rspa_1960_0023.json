The authors found that oxygen reacts with aluminium to form oxide films, and they explored the mechanisms behind this process, including electron tunnelling and cation migration. They also discovered that the rate-determining step is a place exchange of surface oxygen with underlying aluminium atoms, stimulated by reversibly chemisorbed oxygen atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
