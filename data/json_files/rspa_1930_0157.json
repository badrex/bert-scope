They found that the change produced in these solutions was never greater than 4%, and the absorption spectra of these solutions showed only general absorption in the ultra-violet with small molecular coefficients. The study provides insights into the behavior of organic compounds when exposed to light and the efficiency of the photochemical change.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
