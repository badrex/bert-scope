The authors analyze the existence and stability of equilibrium states and interpret the behavior of specific models within this framework. They demonstrate the relationship between earlier two-component models and this broader class of three-component models, assessing their utility as simple scientific test beds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology", "sub_discipline": "Plankton Ecology"}
