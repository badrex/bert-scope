Through a series of experiments, the author determines that the stone's specific gravity is heavier than common stones and closer to that of petrified water. The author also discusses the stone's reaction to various acids and suggests that it may contain metallic particles. This study contributes to the understanding of the nature of concretions and their relationship to animal stones.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine > Anatomy"}
