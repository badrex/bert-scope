They found similarities in cell shape, scale shape, scale arrangement, and surface patterning, suggesting a phyletic connection between the three genera. This research provides a better understanding of the taxonomy and evolution of Calciosoleniaceae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Haptophyceae"}
