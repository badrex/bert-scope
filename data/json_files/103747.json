He explains that the spine's cartilage compresses when a person is standing, making the body shorter. When lying down, the cartilage expands, returning the body to its original height. This phenomenon is more noticeable in younger individuals, as cartilage becomes less elastic with age.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Anatomy"}
