The use of mobile tracers reveals that anodic alumina forms at the metal/film and film/electrolyte interfaces, with no significant formation within the film bulk. The study also assesses film growth behavior in the vicinity of flaws and determines the proportions of film developing at the metal/film and film/electrolyte interfaces using inert and immobile argon markers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
