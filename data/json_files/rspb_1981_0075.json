The authors found that the visual system can accurately interpolate the position of a feature in the visual field, even when the target is moving. They also discovered that temporal and spatial interpolation depend on different parameters and that the basic properties of spatiotemporal interpolation can be understood in terms of the known properties of the visual system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
