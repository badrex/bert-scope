They use the principle of resurgence to relate the divergent parts of the asymptotic series and obtain more accurate approximations by iteratively applying an exact resurgence formula. This method is applicable to a wide range of integrals and can provide deeper understanding of the underlying mathematical and physical problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Asymptotic Analysis"}
