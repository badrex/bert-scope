The author found that agglutination occurs when normal serum and immune red cells or normal red cells and immune serum interact. Auto-agglutination and iso-agglutination were also observed in some cases. These findings contribute to the understanding of human haematology and immune responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
