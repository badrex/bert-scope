They derive exact thermodynamic expressions for principal latent heats, enabling the calculation of these quantities in terms of other properties. The method is applied to the evaluation of the Joule-Thomson coefficient in the two-phase region of a binary system.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
