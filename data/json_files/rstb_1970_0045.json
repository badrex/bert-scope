They present evidence of differential behavior of germ cells with different sex chromosome constitutions and the impact of reciprocal translocations on spermatogenesis. The findings suggest that a significant part of the genetic information in the diploid genome is involved in the process of spermatogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
