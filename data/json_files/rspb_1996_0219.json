The results show that object recognition is associated with the left middle occipital and bilateral anterior temporal cortices, while naming engages the left posterior basal temporal lobe and the left prefrontal cortex. The study also identifies areas specific to object naming and color naming, providing insights into the neural correlates of phonological retrieval and object recognition.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Cognitive Neurology"}
