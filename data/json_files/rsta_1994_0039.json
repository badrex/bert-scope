These conditions are expressed in terms of complete elliptic integrals and are accurate for arbitrary values of the magnetic quantum number. The study covers two choices of the base function, one for large values of the magnetic quantum number and another for small values. The results demonstrate the accuracy of the eigenvalues obtained from the quantization conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
