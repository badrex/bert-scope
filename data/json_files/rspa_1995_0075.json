It uses material property charts and performance indices to compare these natural materials with engineering materials. The study reveals that many natural materials have exceptional mechanical properties and perform better in specific applications. The article also discusses the origins of this superiority and how the structure of these materials influences their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Natural Composites"}
