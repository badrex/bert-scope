The author examines the role of island area, distance from other islands, and the expansion of new taxa in shaping insect distributions. The study highlights the importance of understanding these factors for better conservation and management of island ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
