The author presents various methods to summarize and select among multiple trees, including taxonomic reduction, consensus methods, and secondary optimality criteria. The study aims to resolve the relationships within the sphenodontid crown group using parsimony analysis and different consensus methods, providing a better understanding of the problems and potential solutions in phylogenetic inference.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
