The research explores how deficiencies in nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium affect leaf birth rates, death rates, and survivorship. The findings reveal that the loss of nutrients from older leaves is a cause of leaf senescence rather than a result of it. The study provides insights into the roles and mobilities of different elements in plants and their influence on leaf senescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
