Born in Hanover, Siemens studied at the Polytechnic School of Magdeburg and the University of G\u00f6ttingen. He made significant contributions to electro-gilding, the chronometric governor, anastatic printing, and the water-meter. His work in thermodynamics, particularly the regenerative principle, led to improvements in steam-engine efficiency. Siemens was also a strong advocate for smoke abatement and had plans to create a smokeless method of supplying heat to steam boilers."}
