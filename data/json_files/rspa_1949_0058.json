The authors found that the decomposition occurs through two-point adsorption, leading to a half-hydrogenated state from which the hetero-atom is broken off. The reaction kinetics and mechanisms are discussed, and the role of various catalysts and retardants is analyzed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
