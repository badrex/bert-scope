The author discusses the challenges in comparing results from different observers and the importance of using accurate thermometric scales and units. The article also highlights the need for further experiments to provide more accurate and reliable data on the specific heat variation between 0\u00b0C and 100\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
