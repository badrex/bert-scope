These devices can be used to detect changes in chemical and biological substances by connecting two or more closely spaced microelectrodes with redox-active materials. The author discusses various examples of these devices, including those based on poly(3-methylthiophene), poly(-vinylpyridine), and a quinone redox polymer, and explains their potential applications in sensing.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Sensor Technology"}
