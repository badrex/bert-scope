It highlights the control mechanisms governing the utilization of various substrates and the significance of mixed substrate utilization in microbial competition in nutrient-limited natural environments. The article also explores different responses of bacteria to mixed substrate utilization and the metabolic events underlying this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
