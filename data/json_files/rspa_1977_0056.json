The authors generalize the method to include the Casimir effect in spatially finite models and apply it to space-times of constant curvature. The results reveal that different vacuum states are associated with distinct conformal coordinate systems, highlighting the challenges in defining observables and classifying states in curved-space quantum field theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
