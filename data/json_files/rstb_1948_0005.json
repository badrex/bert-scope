The research identifies two phases of agricultural activity, one in the late Bronze Age and the other in the Iron Age to middle Romano-British period. The findings suggest that both phases were terminated by wet conditions that led to flooding of the raised bogs. The study also reveals a strong correlation between climate and forest composition, indicating that climate change played a significant role in the observed modifications.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoecology"}
