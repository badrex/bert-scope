The authors analyze the electric field associated with a dipole oscillating in a uniform infinite plasma immersed in a uniform magnetic field, finding that resonances occur at the plasma frequency, electron cyclotron frequency, and hybrid frequency, or their harmonics. This research provides a fresh source of information about the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
