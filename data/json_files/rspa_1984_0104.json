They found that the temperature dependence of electron spin relaxation rate in colloids is similar to the resistivity relaxation rate in bulk metals. The Debye temperature in colloidal particles is lower than in bulk metals, and the temperature dependence of both electron spin relaxation and resistivity is adequately described by a Debye function.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
