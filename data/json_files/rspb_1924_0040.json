They found that these substances inhibit clotting and protect against hemolysis by interacting with serum. The study also showed that the presence of calcium chloride can restore coagulability and lytic action. This research sheds light on the relationship between clotting and hemolysis and has implications for understanding blood coagulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
