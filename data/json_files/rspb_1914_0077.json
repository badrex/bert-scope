They discovered that the brain does not absorb salvarsan due to a peculiarity of the cerebral vessels, and the drug is instead rapidly absorbed by the liver and kidneys. This inability to penetrate the brain explains the lack of success in treating certain brain-related syphilitic conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pharmacology"}
