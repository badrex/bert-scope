The tables provide information for designing lenses with magnification and an object at infinity. They also help in selecting glasses for better optical instruments and improving chromatic correction. The tables cover a wide range of refractive indices, making them useful for various applications in physics and optics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics"}
