The partial lifetime for proton decay is found to be longer than the value calculated from the minimal SU(5) theory. The detector is also sensitive to other potential decay modes and rare phenomena, such as magnetic monopoles and neutrino oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
