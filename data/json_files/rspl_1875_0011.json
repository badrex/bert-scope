Gore, conducted experiments to study the electromagnetic rotations of bar-magnets and conducting-wires on their axes. They discovered that when an electric current passes through a magnetized iron rod or wire with dissimilar poles, it causes torsion in the wire. The author also found that reversing the direction of the current or magnetic polarity reverses the direction of the twist. This research helps to understand the fundamental principles of electromagnetism and magnetic rotations."}
