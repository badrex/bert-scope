The authors apply this method to four different cases, discussing the theoretical basis, practical details, and results of their calculations. This approach offers a more efficient alternative to traditional methods, which often require laborious computation and experimental methods like photo-elasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
