It finds that both the absolute number and the proportion of threatened species are highest in the tropics. The research suggests that tropical areas may have more threatened bird species due to higher levels of threatening processes or species being more vulnerable to these processes. The findings highlight the importance of understanding regional patterns in the spatial distribution of threatened species for conservation efforts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
