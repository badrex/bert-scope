They argue that the type of fermentation leading to alcohol and carbonic acid production is a result of the continued action of this modified respiratory enzyme group under anaerobic conditions. This theory is supported by evidence from the author's studies on bacterial fermentation, particularly with Bacillus coli communis. The findings suggest that zymase and respiratory enzymes are closely related, with interesting implications for understanding fermentation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
