They study two possible excitation mechanisms and conclude that one is far more effective than the other. The authors also discuss the significance of the twilight flash and its correlation with magnetic activity and aurorae. They suggest further research to better understand the ionization mechanisms and the role of charged particles in the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
