The results show that InsP3 and extracellular ATP cause an increase in intracellular calcium concentration, with different time courses and mechanisms. This research provides insights into the complex processes involved in calcium signaling in endothelial cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
