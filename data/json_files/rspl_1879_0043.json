The experiments involved applying different types of manure to the land and analyzing the effects on plant growth, species composition, and soil chemistry. The findings reveal significant variations in the amount and botanical character of the produce, as well as differences in the chemical composition of the plants and soil. These results have implications for understanding plant growth and nutrition, as well as the broader scientific disciplines of botany, chemistry, and agriculture.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
