They studied the interaction of nitrogen with the {100} plane of tungsten using a molecular beam technique and found that the results were in quantitative agreement with the kinetic model, allowing for initial trapping into a mobile physisorbed state. This work provides a better understanding of adsorption kinetics and surface stoichiometry in chemisorption processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
