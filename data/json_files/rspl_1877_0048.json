Spottiswoode, describes his successful collaboration with Capt. Abney in photographing the phenomena of stratified discharges. They used a small hydrogen tube and a revolving mirror to capture the images. The photographic image revealed the position, motion, and grouping of the striae, as well as their different actinic power and color. Spottiswoode plans to present a more detailed study in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrophysics"}
