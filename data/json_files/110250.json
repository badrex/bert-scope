He studied its properties, reactions with various substances, and its formation from the mutual action of nitric and muriatic acids. Chloro-nitrous gas has a strong affinity for moisture, bleaches vegetable colors, and forms an acid resembling aqua regia when mixed with water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
