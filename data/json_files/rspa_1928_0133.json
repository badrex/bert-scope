They find that the channel walls have little effect on the vortex street's stability and that the drag coefficient of the body depends mainly on the spacing of the vortices. The study provides a better understanding of fluid dynamics and vortex street behavior in confined spaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
