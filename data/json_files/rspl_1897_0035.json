He discovered that when a person looks at a colored object, their retina can create a negative after-image of complementary colors, which can be seen when viewing the object through the rotating disk. This phenomenon can help explain the greenish-blue borders that appear around bright objects and the abnormal whiteness of black objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Vision and Perception"}
