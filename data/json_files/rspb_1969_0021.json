They found that the intermolecular forces governing permeation of most non-electrolytes are the same as those governing partition between a bulk lipid phase and water. However, two classes of deviations from this pattern are related to the specific structure of cell membranes. Small polar solutes permeate more rapidly than expected, possibly due to their minimal interaction with hydrocarbon tails of membrane lipids and their preference for a route formed by localized concentrations of membrane polar groups associated with \"frozen\" water molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
