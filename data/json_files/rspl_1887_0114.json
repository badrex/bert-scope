They found that nitric acid in the soil plays an important role in providing nitrogen to plants. Additionally, they investigated the possibility of plant roots using their acid sap to break down and absorb organic nitrogen from the subsoil. However, they were unable to conclusively prove this theory through their experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Science"}
