They discovered a surface transition induced by HCl adsorption, which affects the properties of surface ions. The findings suggest that anions in the surface acquire two-dimensional translation during the transition, leading to cooperative interactions and non-ideal behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
