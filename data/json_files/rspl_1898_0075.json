They found that the ophthalmic division of the trigeminus nerve does not innervate the sensorial musculo-tendinous organs of eye-muscles. The experiments also showed that the remaining nerves, Illrd, IVth, and YIth, play a crucial role in controlling eye movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
