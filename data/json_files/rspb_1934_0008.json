They found that the macular representation in the geniculate body is not as extensive as previously thought, and the structure of the lateral geniculate body in monkeys closely resembles that of humans. The study confirmed the localization of retinal fibers within the geniculate body and provided insights into the organization of the visual system.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Vision"}
