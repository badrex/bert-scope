They discover a small proportion of endplate axonal ramifications with microtubules clothed in synaptic vesicles focused on the presynaptic membrane, particularly at active zones. The author discusses the possibility that microtubules are involved in the translocation of synaptic vesicles to the active zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
