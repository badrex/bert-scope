The author found that the albumen of fresh eggs freezes like water, unlike other substances, and suggested that this unique property may be due to a mechanical construction peculiarity. This research sheds light on the nature and purpose of egg albumen and its differences from other albuminous substances and organic tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
