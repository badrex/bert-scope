The author explains the causes of this instability, such as resonance and external disturbances, and provides a mathematical analysis of the oscillations and their damping. The article also suggests methods to improve the stability of alternating-current machines, like using damping coils or \"amortisseurs.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromechanics"}
