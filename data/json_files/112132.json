They discovered new ethers, acids, and salts with unique properties, such as ethylic amylhydroxalate, ethylic diamyloxalate, and amyloxalic acid. These findings expanded the understanding of lactic acid derivatives and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
