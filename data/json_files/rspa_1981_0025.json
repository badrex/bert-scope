The researchers observed nine chemically and physically distinct stable modes of reaction, including seven types of stable oscillations and two stationary states. They mapped the conditions for each mode on an ignition diagram and found unprecedented variety in the behavior of the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
