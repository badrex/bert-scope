The author assumes that the spins of all particles within the energy band system are aligned in the ground state. An exact expression for the energy is obtained, considering one plausible assumption and examining it for a one-band model with short-range inter-particle interactions. The results provide a more accurate understanding of spin wave energies in ferromagnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
