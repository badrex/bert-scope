It examines asymmetric disturbances and shows how they provide the initial instability of drops suspended at an orifice of sufficiently large radius. The results confirm the earlier findings of Plateau and Maxwell on the instability of horizontal plane interfaces. The main focus is on the mode that precedes the higher modes, and the conditions for asymmetric bifurcation are derived.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
