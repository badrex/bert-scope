The protein interacts with E2F-1, a transcription factor, to regulate cell division. Mutations that inactivate the retinoblastoma protein can lead to uncontrolled cell growth and tumorigenesis. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of tumour suppressor genes and their role in maintaining cell growth regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
