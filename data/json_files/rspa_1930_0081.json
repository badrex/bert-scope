The authors measured and analyzed new bands belonging to the third progression, confirming the vibrational and rotational analysis of chlorine molecules. They also found isotopic bands and discussed the consequences of the new numbering on the vibration constants for the lowest state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular physics"}
