Nacre is a platelet-reinforced composite filled with 95% calcium carbonate, which is a high filler content compared to man-made composites. The study measures and models three mechanical properties: the Young modulus, tensile strength, and fracture toughness of nacre. The results show that nacre has a high work of fracture and is remarkably strong and ductile, making it an ideal material for studying composite materials and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Composite Materials"}
