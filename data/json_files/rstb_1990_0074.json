The researchers found that changes in land-use and management did not cause the acidification of lakes. Instead, they concluded that the acidification was mainly due to acid precipitation. The study used documentary sources and pollen analysis to assess the role of land-use and management changes in relation to lake acidification.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental History and Paleoenvironmental Studies"}
