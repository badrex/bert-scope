They discovered a complex anomaly in the region of the ketonic absorption band at 2900 A.U., which they explained through the study of circular dichroism. This research provided a deeper understanding of the rotatory dispersion of these compounds in vapour form.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
