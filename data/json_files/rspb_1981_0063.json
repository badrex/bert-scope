The results show that melanosome aggregation in epidermal and dermal melanophores is under neural control, while the pituitary has no involvement in melanosome dispersion. However, pituitary extract injection into hypophysectomized flounder elicited a melanophore concentrating hormone effect. The study provides insights into the contrasting roles of neural and pituitary elements in controlling melanophore and xanthophore responses, which are essential for patterning and hue adaptations in winter flounder.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuroendocrinology"}
