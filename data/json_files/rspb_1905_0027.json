The author found that the fungus can penetrate deep into the plant's internal tissues and produce haustoria, which are structures that help it extract nutrients from the host. This ability to adapt to different conditions suggests that other ectoparasitic fungi may also be capable of similar endophytic behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
