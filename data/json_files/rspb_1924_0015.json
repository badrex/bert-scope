They found that insects exposed to extreme heat and dry conditions have lower body temperatures than expected, likely due to water loss during respiration. The author also discovered that some grasshoppers have different color forms, with darker individuals having higher body temperatures. This research provides insights into how desert insects survive harsh environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Environmental Biology"}
