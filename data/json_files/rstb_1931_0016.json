They found that all species produced appreciable amounts of alcohol, similar to Saccharomyces. The study also revealed two sub-groups of Fusarium with unique characteristics, such as acidity production and respiration coefficients. The authors suggest that selected species of Fusarium could be used to produce alcohol from waste vegetable matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
