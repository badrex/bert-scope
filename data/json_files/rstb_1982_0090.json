It highlights the different capacities of sulphate-reducing bacteria to degrade organic compounds and their significance in terminal oxidation. The article also introduces new species of sulphate-reducing bacteria that can oxidize acetate and other organic compounds, making them essential for the complete oxidation of organic matter in sulphate-sufficient environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
