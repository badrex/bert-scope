The authors re-formulate the theory, treating vacancies as separate thermodynamic species with zero charge and mass. They derive the equation for entropy production for ionic crystals containing defects and provide correct expressions for the chemical potentials. The new theory of heterogeneous thermoelectric power is developed, and a possible experimental test is suggested.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
