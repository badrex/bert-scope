The research finds that almost all solids mixed with the reactant calcium sulphite increased both reaction rates and extents of oxidation. The pattern of kinetic behavior remained unchanged, and the authors conclude that the additive does not change the reaction mechanism but increases the permeability to oxygen of the adherent product layer that forms a barrier between calcium sulphite and oxygen. The promotional ability of each additive is determined by a balance between enhanced ease of transport across the barrier and the diminution of rate due to crystallite growth through sintering.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
