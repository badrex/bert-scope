This phenomenon was previously known to early anatomists but had been overlooked in recent times. The authors argue that this pulsation is essential in preventing blood reflux into the veins during the contraction of the auricle, especially in cases of valvular heart disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
