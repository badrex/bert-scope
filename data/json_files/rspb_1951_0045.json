Bimodal nerves contain large and small fibers, while unimodal nerves have only one size of fibers. The size of nerve fibers is influenced by factors such as the extent of the peripheral field innervated and the amount of afferent and central stimulation received. The study provides insights into the relationship between nerve fiber size and muscle function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
