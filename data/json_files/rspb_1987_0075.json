The sodium currents in oocytes from different donors showed varying kinetics, suggesting the expression of different sodium channels. These findings may complicate experiments studying the expression of foreign sodium channels in oocytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
