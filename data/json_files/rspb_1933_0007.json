The research finds that both species have similar iris structures and respond to drugs like pilocarpine, acetyl choline, and adrenaline, but with varying degrees of constriction and dilation. The study also examines the neural pathways and the role of neurotransmitters in controlling the iris movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy and Physiology"}
