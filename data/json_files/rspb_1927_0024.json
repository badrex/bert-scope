The researchers found that the oestrous cycle persisted even after the destruction of Graafian follicles in the ovaries. They concluded that the periodic ovarian activity, rather than the follicles, is responsible for the production of oestrin, which causes oestrus. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the post-irradiation changes in the ovaries and the factors influencing the cyclic endocrine activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
