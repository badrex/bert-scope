These functions are essential for evaluating various integrals and expanding the integral calculus. The tables include values from 0 to 1 at intervals of 0.01, and values from 1 to 20 at increasing intervals, providing accurate results to the desired decimal places.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
