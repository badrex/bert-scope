The author observes the mating habits of the butterflies and their different forms, which mimic other species. The research also discusses the challenges faced during the breeding process, such as larval mortality and the difficulty of pairing the butterflies. The author provides a Mendelian interpretation of the results and compares the findings with similar work on other species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
