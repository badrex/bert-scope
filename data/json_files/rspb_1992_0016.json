They found that the block increased with membrane depolarization and that the kinetics of block were accelerated by increasing L-cis-diltiazem concentration and depolarization. The results suggest that L-cis-diltiazem interacts with a binding site located about halfway across the membrane field and is unable to fully traverse the cyclic GMP-activated channel.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
