They measured the cathodic polarization behavior of various solid metals in solutions of HC1 and DC1 and discussed the possible rate-determining mechanisms in the overall process. The results showed significant isotopic effects and provided insights into the role of surface coverage by adsorbed hydrogen and deuterium in the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
