They found that the oscillations were reproducible and predictable within a specific range of reaction temperatures. A mathematical analysis of the reacting system closely predicted the nature, frequency, and range of the oscillations, providing insights into the dynamics of the system and potential improvements in temperature control.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactor Dynamics"}
