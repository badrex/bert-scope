He argues that all nerve cells have at least two fibers connected to them, which supports the idea of complete nervous circuits. Beale also discusses the formation and structure of ganglion cells, as well as the nature of nerve fibers and their connections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
