They found that changes in the culture medium, such as temperature and yeast composition, affected the gene's exhibition. The authors discovered that certain yeast substances encouraged or inhibited the exhibition of the gene, and that the balance of these substances changed based on yeast strains and environmental conditions. They also found that the transition from aerobic to anaerobic yeast respiration in the culture medium was related to changes in gene exhibition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
