They found that the rate of polymerization increases until about 50% conversion and then rapidly decreases. The overall energy of activation decreases initially and then increases as the polymerization progresses. The authors also discovered that the activation energy for the termination reaction increases with the increasing viscosity of the medium, and the propagation step becomes diffusion-controlled as the system turns into a solid polymer gel.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
