They identified this part as the nuclear specific heat due to nuclear-electronic interaction within the atom. The results are in agreement with observations of the hyperfine structure in dilute copper salts made from paramagnetic resonance experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
