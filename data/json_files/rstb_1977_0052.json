They find that the primary visual cortex of kittens has a basic organization of orientation columns and binocular cells, which can be altered by visual experience. Monocular deprivation causes a shift in ocular dominance, while exposure to specific orientations affects the distribution of preferred orientations in cortical neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
