They found that swarming, a natural behavior in honey bees, can reduce mite density within a colony. This discovery has implications for modern hive management techniques and may help explain the sudden appearance of tracheal mites in various regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
