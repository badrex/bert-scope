The authors propose that large stretching factors, greater than 3, control the transition from continental lithosphere stretching to oceanic accretion through the production of significant partial melting in the asthenosphere. This process significantly affects the law of subsidence and can lead to the formation of deep continental margin basins, such as the Armorican deep continental margin basin.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
