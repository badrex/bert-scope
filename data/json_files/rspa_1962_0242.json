They suggested an hypothesis to explain the results and calculated the velocity of propagation of twin lamellae in the temperature range of 20 to 100\u00b0C. An activation energy for twin propagation was also calculated. Direct observation of the twinning process using a high-speed camera confirmed the hypothesis and results, showing that the velocity of propagation of twin lamellae in calcite is not very dependent on the applied shear stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
