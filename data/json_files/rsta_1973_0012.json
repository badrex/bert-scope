The belt consists of reworked Archaean terrain and an early Proterozoic cover sequence, the Messina Formation, which has been metamorphosed and deformed with the pre-cover basement. The Limpopo belt is divided into three zones: the northern marginal zone, the central zone, and the southern marginal zone. The study provides insights into the tectonic, metamorphic, and evolutionary aspects of the belt, as well as the post-metamorphic cover sequences and intrusive igneous activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
