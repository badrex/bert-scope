They found significant differences between algal growth in the tropics and in temperate regions, highlighting the influence of diverse external conditions on tropical algal vegetation. The study focused on subaerial and freshwater algal growth, with the author outlining the general features of distribution and biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
