The substance was explosive and could react violently with various substances, including phosphorus, mercury, and alcohol. Davy proposed that the compound could be a combination of nitrogen and chlorine similar to the one mentioned in a letter from Paris. The discovery led to further experiments and understanding of the properties and potential dangers of the new substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Explosives"}
