They found that fog significantly reduces the distance sound signals can travel, leading to the need for more effective fog signals. The author also tested various sound-producing instruments, including steam-whistles and a steam-siren, to determine their performance in different fog conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
