The authors found that bile acids' antibacterial properties are related to their high surface activity and hydrophobic-hydrophilic structure. They also discovered that certain bile derivatives with strong solvent action on the Gram-positive complex have a particularly strong antibacterial action.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Bacteriology"}
