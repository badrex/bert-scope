They found that this effect was more pronounced at lower pressures and when the inner coating of the glass tube was positively charged. This phenomenon did not occur when the magnetic pole-pieces were both north or both south. The authors also observed that when sufficient positive electricity was supplied to the inner coating while the magnet was excited, the charge rapidly withdrew and eventually resided upon the pole-pieces themselves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
