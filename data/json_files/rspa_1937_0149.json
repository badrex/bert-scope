They apply this method to equations with two independent variables and specific boundary conditions. The method involves replacing derivatives with respect to one variable with finite difference ratios and integrating the other variable mechanically. The authors also discuss the process of extrapolation to correct for errors in the solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical methods"}
