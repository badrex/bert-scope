It examines the tectonic evolution of the adjacent North Atlantic and the results of Shell's offshore exploration campaign from 1973 to 1977. The study reveals the rifting process, sedimentary sequences, and basin inversion that occurred in these regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
