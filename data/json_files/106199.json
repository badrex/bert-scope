It demonstrates that an equilateral triangle is larger than any other inscribed triangle and smaller than any other triangle described about the same circle. The article also provides a proof that the square of an equilateral triangle's side is equal to a rectangle under the diameter of the circle and a perpendicular drawn from any angle to the opposite side.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
