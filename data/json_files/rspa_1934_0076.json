They explain how the rotatory power is determined by the arrangement and properties of the refractive centers in the molecule, and provide a formula to calculate it. This formula can be applied to various types of optically active compounds, but is only suitable for molecules with short, fairly simple radicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Geometry"}
