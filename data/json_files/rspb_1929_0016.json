They propose that the greater ionic mobility of potassium ions compared to sodium ions may cause potassium to be adsorbed preferentially at interfaces within cells. To test this theory, the author conducts experiments using a controlled adsorbent, providing insights into the factors influencing the distribution of potassium in living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
