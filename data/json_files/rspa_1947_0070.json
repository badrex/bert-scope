The authors analyze the range and energy of the scattered particles, finding that terms contribute to the amplitude of the scattered wave. The study provides insights into the range-energy relation for the photographic emulsion used and supports the assumption of a constant stopping power for protons and deuterons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
