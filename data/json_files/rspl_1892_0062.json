They discover that the flask-shaped cells are excretory and are identical to the spongoblasts. This finding challenges previous assumptions about the structure and function of the sponge's outer surface and provides new insights into the anatomy and biology of sponges.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Porifera"}
