They observed different crystal forms and combinations, and determined the indices of refraction for different rays and wavelengths. The crystals exhibited a symmetry compatible with either the prismatic or oblique system, and were often found in twinned formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
