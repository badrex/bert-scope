The yeasts were grown on cotton-wool plugs and identified using Hansen's spore method. The longevity of these yeasts is of great scientific interest, but it remains unclear whether they retained their vitality as resting cells or spores.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
