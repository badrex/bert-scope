They discovered that the explosion created a shell of electrons around Earth, fed by fission fragments near Johnston Island. The study also found that the explosion disrupted some outer belt electrons into the atmosphere and led to a softer spectrum of additional electrons at high L values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Physics"}
