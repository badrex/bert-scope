They observe changes in cell form and internal features, focusing on the cytoskeleton's role in cell shape and division. The study provides insights into the infection biology of the organism and sets the foundation for future molecular approaches to understanding its regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
