It explores the mechanisms responsible for promoting metastable bonding and the electronic, mechanical, and structural properties of diamond-like carbon. The article also compares different deposition methods, such as ion beam deposition, plasma deposition, and laser plasma deposition, and their effects on the resulting film properties."}
