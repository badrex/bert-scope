The results suggest that simpler methods used for computing polarizabilities are satisfactory, but less accurate for computing shielding factors. The study provides a more refined treatment of the helium sequence, which is important for understanding atomic systems and their interactions with external charges.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Physics"}
