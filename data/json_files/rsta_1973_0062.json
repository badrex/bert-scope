The author proposes using simple dislocation models, such as horizontal screw and vertical edge dislocations, to understand the motion on faults and plan strain gauge layouts to detect these movements. The article also explores the use of strain gauges in different orientations to gather information about the inhomogeneities of plastic strain below the Earth's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
