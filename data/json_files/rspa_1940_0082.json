The method can be extended to plates with straight boundaries, allowing for a more comprehensive understanding of stress distribution in various plate configurations. The solution is demonstrated through a specific case of an infinite plate under tension with three circular holes in a row, and the results are compared with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
