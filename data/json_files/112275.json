He describes the synthesis of several new compounds, including nitrate of diazobenzol and nitrate of naphthylamin, and their properties and reactions. These discoveries expanded the understanding of nitrogen-substituted derivatives and their potential applications in chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
