{"article_id": "rspl_1881_0083", "revised_title": "Vortex Ring Vibrations and Interactions", "semantic_tags": ["Fluid Dynamics", "Vortex Theory", "Aerodynamics", "Mathematical Physics", "Applied Mathematics"], "tldr": "The authors investigate the vibrations of a vortex ring and the interaction between two vortex rings. They derive equations for the angular velocity and displacement of the vortex rings and discuss the effects of their motion on each other, such as deflection of direction, change in radius, and alteration in energy and velocity of translation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
