He observed that the Torpedo's electric shock was similar to the discharge of a Leyden jar, a device used to store and release electricity. This research contributed to the understanding of animal electricity and the Torpedo's biological mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Electricity"}
