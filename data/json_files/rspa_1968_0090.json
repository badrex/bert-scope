It presents various plasma models, including the hydromagnetic, guiding centre, and Vlasov models, and explores the different types of instabilities that can affect plasma confinement systems. The author highlights the importance of magnetic field configuration and stability in achieving successful plasma containment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
