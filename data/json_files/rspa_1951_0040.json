Lactis Aerogenes", "semantic_tags": ["Bacterial Growth", "Anaerobic Processes", "Oxidation-Reduction", "Microbiology", "Pasteur Effect"], "tldr": "The authors studied the oxidation-reduction processes in bacterial cultures, specifically the anaerobic growth of Bact. lactis aerogenes. They observed that anaerobic growth is slower than aerobic growth and consumes more substrate. The transition from aerobic to anaerobic growth involves adjustments, such as the development of a new mechanism for re-oxidation of reduced hydrogen carriers. Re-aeration cuts down fermentative processes by lowering the concentrations of reduced hydrogen carriers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
