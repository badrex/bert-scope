It shows that the secretory granules originate outside the Golgi network and then move into the Golgi area, where they transform into mature mucin granules. This process is similar to that found in other gland cells, such as salivary glands and pancreas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
