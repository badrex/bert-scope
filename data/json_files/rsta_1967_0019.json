These ceramics combine zirconia, a second ceramic material, and a metal to provide electrical conductivity, thermal shock resistance, and high-temperature stability. The research focuses on understanding the conduction mechanisms, both electronic and ionic, in these materials to improve their performance in energy conversion applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
