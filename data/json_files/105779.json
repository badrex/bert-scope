By dividing the plants multiple times, he was able to increase the number of plants and their yield. This experiment demonstrated the potential for improving crop yields and showed that even in poor soil, the plants could thrive. Mr. Miller plans to continue his experiments to further explore the possibilities of increasing agricultural productivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture"}
