Soame observed the variation of the compass needle in the Baltic Sea. They recorded the magnetic amplitude and true amplitude at different locations, which helped determine the compass variation. These observations were crucial for navigation during that time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
