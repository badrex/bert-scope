The author examines the factors affecting tidal friction, such as the depth and width of channels, and estimates the dissipation in various regions. The study also highlights the influence of friction on tidal velocities and the challenges in measuring and predicting tidal currents in complex coastal areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
