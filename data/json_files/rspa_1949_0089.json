They calculate the coefficient of self-diffusion in gases and provide a method to approximate the coefficient of diffusion in liquids. The study reveals the differences between self-diffusion and mutual diffusion and highlights the importance of obtaining the true local velocity distribution for a more accurate understanding of diffusion in liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
