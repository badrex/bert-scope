The researchers found that after denervation, the whole cell surface becomes sensitive to acetylcholine, unlike in normally innervated neurons where synaptic areas alone are highly sensitive. This discovery adds to the understanding of neuronal supersensitivity and chemoreceptive areas in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
