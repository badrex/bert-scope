The authors form films using serum albumin, pepsin, polylysine, and arabinic acid at hydrocarbon/water interfaces and measure their rheology using a new rheometer. The results help understand molecular interactions and the flexibility of large molecules at interfaces, which is essential for understanding cell membranes and stabilizing foams and emulsions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
