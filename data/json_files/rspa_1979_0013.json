They find that the critical Taylor numbers for different modes are affected by the length of the annulus, and that the finiteness of the container can lead to distinct disturbance flow fields compared to infinite problems. The study provides insights into the behavior of Taylor cells in finite-length containers and the effects of end conditions on the stability of the flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
