Domestic chicks were used in experiments to test the hypothesis that aggregation increases the effectiveness of warning signals or chemical defenses by exploiting predator learning mechanisms. The results showed that birds learned to avoid unpalatable prey faster and more effectively when the prey was in aggregated arrangements, suggesting that gregariousness can be an aposematic strategy to enhance the effectiveness of warning signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
