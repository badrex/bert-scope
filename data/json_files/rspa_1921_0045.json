This new form has several advantages over the original design, including reduced local heating, less disintegration of the platinum wire, no acid fumes, and improved rectification properties. The interrupter can be used with alternating currents without causing the wire to melt, and it works effectively at higher temperatures. The device's potential applications include X-ray generation and electrolytic processes."}
