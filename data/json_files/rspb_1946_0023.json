They found that the inactivation of bacteriophages is due to a single ionization, which can help differentiate between macromolecular viruses and organism-type viruses. The smallest phage studied (S-13) is a macromolecular virus, while the larger phages (C-36 and Staph-K) are more complex organism-type viruses with some differentiation into genetic and cytoplasmic material.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
