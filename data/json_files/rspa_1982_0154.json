They develop a formal symmetry reduction method that does not depend on assumptions about the interaction details. The theory is applicable to both magnetic and non-magnetic hosts and accounts for spin-orbit coupling. The study aims to provide a general understanding of the energy levels of ion pairs in crystals, which can be useful for interpreting pair spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
