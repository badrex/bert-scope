Fast neutron reactors can achieve breeding ratios higher than 1, allowing for the reproduction of fissile material at a rate that can surpass the consumption. However, they also present challenges such as compact core designs, high heat production rates, and large neutron fluxes. The article highlights the unique features of fast neutron reactors and their potential advantages over slow neutron reactors.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
