The authors develop constitutive equations based on conservation laws and an entropy inequality, which help explain the spinning phenomenon observed when heating these materials. The theory provides an explanation for the observations made by Lehmann in 1900, and it can be used to understand the behavior of cholesteric liquid crystals in various situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
