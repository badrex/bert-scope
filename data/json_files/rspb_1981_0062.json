The results show a bimodal distribution of motoneuron sizes, with smaller neurons (gamma motoneurons) and larger neurons (alpha motoneurons) in all motonuclei except for the foot musculature. The study provides insights into the morphology and function of different types of motoneurons in the mouse spinal cord.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
