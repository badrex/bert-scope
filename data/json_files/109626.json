They discovered the worms' shells are made of carbonate of lime and an animal gelatinous substance. The worms have a unique way of breathing and feeding, using their tentacles to catch food and their shells to protect them. The author also discussed the worms' internal structure, circulation, and the possibility of other marine animals having similar breathing organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
