The authors develop a new framework for analyzing periodic patterns on the ocean surface, focusing on the wave-generated mean flow and the linear stability of two- and three-dimensional traveling waves. The study uses a generalized Hamiltonian structure and a distinct symplectic operator for each unbounded direction and time, leading to new insights on wave-mean flow coupling and instability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
