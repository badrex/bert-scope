This action is not due to competitive receptor binding and is similar to the action of other non-competitive blocking drugs. The study provides insights into the mechanism of curare action and its effects on neuromuscular blocking agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
