They demonstrate that the appearance of superluminal group velocities is not a sufficient condition for causality violation and that Lorentz-invariant wave equations, including the Feinberg 'tachyon', are causal. They also discuss the propagation of Klein-Gordon waves and Bludman-Ruderman sound waves, concluding that they do not violate causality.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity"}
