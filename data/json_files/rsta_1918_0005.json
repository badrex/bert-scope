The authors develop a mathematical framework to analyze the behavior of molecules of different kinds and provide exact expressions for the coefficients of diffusion, viscosity, and thermal conduction applicable to the most general case of a composite monatomic gas. The results are compared with experimental data and other theoretical models, showing good agreement and advancing our understanding of these fundamental phenomena in gas dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas dynamics"}
