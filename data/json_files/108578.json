They found that the ova can withstand exposure to moist air and temperature changes, but extreme cold can be fatal. The author also discovered that the journey from one river to another can be detrimental to the ova, especially if they are not in an advanced stage of development. These findings contribute to the understanding of fish distribution and breeding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
