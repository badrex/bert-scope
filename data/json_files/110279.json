He proposes an innovative hypothesis that suggests humans have an internal \"cerebral eye\" that receives impressions from both external eyes and helps interpret visual information. This hypothesis compares the cerebral eye to a compass guiding a ship, allowing the mind to understand the direction of the body despite not directly perceiving the external object.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
