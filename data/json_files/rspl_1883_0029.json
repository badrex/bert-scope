They used a modified apparatus to maintain consistent temperature and humidity, and employed both electrical resistance and optical measurements to determine the thickness of the films. The mean thickness of black films was found to be approximately 11.6 X 10^-6 mm, with a range of 7.2 X 10^-6 to 14.5 X 10^-6 mm. This study provides insight into the behavior of thin films and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Tension"}
