They found that the first detectable effect of acetylcholine is a decrease in the slope of the pacemaker potential without a detectable hyperpolarization or change in action potential duration. This negative chronotropic effect is blocked by atropine and is mimicked by low doses of acetylcholine or muscarine chloride.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
