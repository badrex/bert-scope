The author introduces the stochastic importance for neutron transport theory and relates it to the conventional deterministic importance. The study of neutron transport theory has applications in cosmic ray showers, neutron fission reactors, fusion reactors, and electron cascades.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
