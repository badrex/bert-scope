{"article_id": "rspb_1981_0015", "revised_title": "Exploring the Molecular Structure and Function of Prealbumin and its Relationship with the Thyroid Hormone Nuclear Receptor", "semantic_tags": ["Thyroid hormones", "Nuclear receptor", "Prealbumin", "Molecular structure", "Hormone binding"], "tldr": "This article discusses the molecular structure and function of prealbumin, a protein involved in thyroid hormone binding and vitamin A transport. The author examines the relationship between prealbumin and the thyroid hormone nuclear receptor, suggesting that they may share functional similarities. The study provides insights into the mode of action of thyroid hormones and their receptors in target cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
