It uses anatomical and electrophysiological techniques to define the boundaries of these areas and explores the neural mechanisms involved in stereopsis. The research reveals that most cells in the prestriate areas are binocularly driven, and the degree of binocular interaction varies from cell to cell. The study also identifies at least six areas within the prestriate cortex and discusses their potential roles in stereoscopic vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Neuroscience"}
