The platypus cochlea shares more resemblance with birds than mammals, having a curved tube with a slightly enlarged rounded apex. The interior of the platypus cochlea is divided into two unequal parts by a lamina, with the outer portion being bony and the inner portion membranous. The author also describes the scala media or ductus cochleae, which is the membranous labyrinth of the cochlea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
