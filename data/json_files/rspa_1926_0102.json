They found that the increase in refractive index contributes to the lowering of tone in paintings, in addition to the yellowing of the oil. This discovery helps to understand the reasons behind the degradation of oil paintings and provides insights for artists and conservators to preserve and restore them.", "scientific_discipline": "Art and Humanities > Art Conservation"}
