The authors find that the optimal threshold for harvesting differs depending on whether one maximizes the total return before extinction or the rate of return per unit time. They also emphasize the importance of considering extinction and restart times in resource management.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Ecology"}
