They measured the second virial coefficients of ammonia and various amines, and discovered that primary and secondary amines dimerize, while tertiary amines do not. The energy of the hydrogen bond was discussed, and the results suggest that hydrogen bonding is responsible for dimerization in these substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical bonding and molecular geometry"}
