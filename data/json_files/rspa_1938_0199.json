They construct the grand partition function and derive expressions for average properties, such as the fraction of sites occupied and the probability of a given site being occupied. They also introduce quasi-chemical equilibrium relations to analyze the problem and determine the free energy of the assembly.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
