The research focuses on the demography of buds and how they respond to different environmental conditions. The findings show that neighboring trees can significantly impact the growth of branches, with fewer buds being born and a higher proportion dying in areas most affected by interference from neighboring trees. The age of a branch also plays a crucial role in its performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
