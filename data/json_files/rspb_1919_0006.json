These ingredients can be separated and identified through macroscopic and microscopic examination, and their different reactions to chemical treatments indicate that they have different chemical compositions. The research provides a better understanding of the composition and structure of coal, which can be useful for the coal mining and energy industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
