They demonstrate that reduced stability of dilational waves can lead to mode mixing, which has different characteristics from previously studied cases. The theoretical predictions are supported by experimental data from dilute aqueous solutions of n-heptanol.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
