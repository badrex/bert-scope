The authors extend the geometric theory to include the Hamiltonian structure of the equation and demonstrate that the set of polynomial conserved densities is incomplete. They also prove that a complete set of conserved densities for the sine-Gordon equation necessarily includes non-local densities, which are in involution.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
