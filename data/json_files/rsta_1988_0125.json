They identified various tectonic environments and provinces, providing insights into the region's past and present geological history. The findings contribute to the understanding of the India-Eurasia continent-continent collision event and the evolution of the Tibetan Plateau.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Plate Tectonics"}
