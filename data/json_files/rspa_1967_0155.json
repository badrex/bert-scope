The phonon dispersion relation is investigated along the symmetry directions, and a force-constant model is used to interpret the experimental measurements. The results provide insights into the interactions between lattice vibrations and conduction electrons in white tin, which is essential for understanding its unique properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
