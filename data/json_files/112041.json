It includes preliminary research connected to the author's previous memoir on skew surfaces and explores the theory of cubic scrolls. The author finds eight species of quartic scrolls and discusses the possibility of subforms that might have been counted as distinct species by M. Chasles.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
