He disproved the idea that atmospheric pressure or the attraction of the containing surface was responsible for this phenomenon. Instead, he found that the height of the water column suspended in a capillary tube is directly related to the tube's diameter, and that surface tension plays a significant role in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
