The authors examine the system behavior of atoms with specific angular momenta interacting resonantly in a ring cavity with radiation modes. They discuss the mean field solutions for these systems and the impact of ground-level collision rates on the development of asymmetry between output and fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
