They found that the Naturally Infected Dog strain did not provide immunity against the Human, Wild, and Zululand strains of the trypanosome. This study is important for understanding disease transmission and potential treatments for trypanosomiasis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
