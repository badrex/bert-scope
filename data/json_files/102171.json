He explains the reasons behind the continual Eastern winds under the equator, the Western winds found on the other side of the Tropic, and the changes in wind direction during different seasons. He also discusses the differences in weather and seasonal changes in distant places within the same country, such as the regions of Malabar and Coromandel.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
