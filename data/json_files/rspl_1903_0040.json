The authors discovered that helium is produced from radium and that radioactivity can cause gases to discharge electricity. They also found that radium emanation can withstand various treatments, such as sparking with oxygen and heating with magnesium-lime. The authors express their gratitude to the Research Fund of the Chemical Society for supporting their research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiochemistry"}
