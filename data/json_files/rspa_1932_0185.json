The authors describe various experimental methods and observations, including the effects of temperature, pressure, and gas ratios. They find that the mechanism of the low-pressure explosion is different from that of thermal explosions and may be independent of water presence. The results contribute to the understanding of combustion and chemical reactions in gas mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
