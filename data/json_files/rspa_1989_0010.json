The author analyzes axial perturbations of a special case of the Majumdar-Papapetrou solution in general relativity and derives equations governing these perturbations. The author demonstrates that the energy flux in the system has a divergence that vanishes, leading to a conservation theorem that is essential for understanding the scattering process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
