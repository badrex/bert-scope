They also find that the molecular structure of an iron wire changes when exposed to electricity or magnetism, and that the movement of molecules can be detected through sonorous vibrations. These findings contribute to the understanding of molecular magnetism and its relationship with electricity and magnetism in conducting wires.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
