He examines the principles of mechanics, the theorem of equilibrium, and the six simple machines, including levers, axles, pulleys, wedges, inclined planes, and screws. Hamilton critiques existing methods of explaining these principles and offers his own insights, emphasizing the importance of understanding the true nature of these machines for the advancement of the mechanic arts.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
