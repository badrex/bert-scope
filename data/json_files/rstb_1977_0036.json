The authors explore the properties of supercooled water and heavy water, and their findings suggest that increased supercooling promotes a more structured state in the water, leading to a greater tendency for water molecules to form clusters. The article also highlights the need for further research on the thermodynamic properties of supercooled water and heavy water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Water and Solutions"}
