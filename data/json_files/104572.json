He explains the theory behind his discovery, which is based on the idea that heat is not proportional to the quantity of light and that the rays do not come parallel from the sun. Buffon has constructed a speculum that is six feet wide and high, which can burn wood at a distance of 200 feet and melt tin and lead. He is currently working on new experiments to further explore this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
