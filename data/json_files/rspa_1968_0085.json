They found that the blast wave is the correct limit of the flow, and the integral in question is very small, within the anticipated numerical error. However, they also discovered that an infinite set of integrals must vanish to prevent a contradiction in the matching procedure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
