Bismuth is found to be in the 3+ state, and the bronze structures exhibit interesting properties such as electrical resistivity and itinerant electrons. The study also reveals that the maximum value of x in BixW03 appears to be around 0.07.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
