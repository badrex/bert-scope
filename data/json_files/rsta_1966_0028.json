The results provide insights into the behavior of graphite monocrystals under irradiation conditions and help in understanding the accumulation of irradiation damage in fast-neutron-irradiated graphite. The findings contribute to the interpretation of dimensional changes in polycrystalline aggregates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
