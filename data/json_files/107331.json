He discovered that these oxides are peroxides and found that they can be converted into alkali by heating them with metallic or inflammable matter. Davy also investigated the electrical decomposition of potash and soda, and the formation of prot-oxides in voltaic operations on potash.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
