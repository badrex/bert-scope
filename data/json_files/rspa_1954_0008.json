They found that the C=0 stretching mode frequency is a good indicator of the polypeptide chain configuration, with optically active forms having a range of 1652-1657 cm\u207b\u00b9 and meso forms having a slightly higher range of 1661-1665 cm\u207b\u00b9. The study also showed that the effect of absorbed water on the spectra of some polypeptides is mainly additive.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
