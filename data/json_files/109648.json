They found that 100 parts of carbonic acid contain 28.6% of carbon, and that the diamond differs from charcoal only in the firmness of its aggregation. This research helped to clarify the composition of carbonic acid and the chemical properties of diamonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Carbon Chemistry"}
