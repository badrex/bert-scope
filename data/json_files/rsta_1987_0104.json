The authors present data on the vertical and horizontal distributions of various minor constituents in the middle atmosphere, including ozone, nitrogen oxides, and water vapor. They highlight the Antarctic ozone hole, interannual variability in nitrous oxide and methane, and the exchange of nitrogen from the mesosphere to the stratosphere during polar night. The article also emphasizes the need for further research on the effects of human activity on the middle atmosphere and the importance of understanding atmospheric processes for climate change.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
