The authors provide evidence that the prion protein and incubation time genes are identical and that the properties of scrapie isolates can be explained by constraints on interaction between PrPc and PrPSc, and by PrP concentration. Additionally, the article presents the novel finding that uninoculated mice overexpressing wild-type PrP transgenes spontaneously develop a late-onset degenerative neuromyopathy, broadening the spectrum of prion diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
