They found that the intensity of X-rays was not uniform and suggested improvements to the design of the bulb to enhance efficiency and safety. The authors also discussed the effects of varying the hardness of the X-rays and the impact of oblique and normal incidence of cathode rays on the distribution of X-rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
