He concludes that voltaic instruments with copper surrounding zinc do not require insulation, leading to new battery designs. Faraday also compares the efficiency of different acids in voltaic action, finding nitric acid to be the most effective. He recommends a specific acid composition for optimal battery performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
