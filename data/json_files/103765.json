He discovered that the beetle beats its head against the sedge to prepare its food or possibly for exercise. The beetle's unique helmet-like structure provides protection from falls in its natural environment. The author also observed the beetle's wings for the first time when exposed to sunlight, which had been previously hidden under its body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
