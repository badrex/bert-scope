They develop a theory of electromagnetic induction in a non-uniform conductor and apply it to terrestrial magnetic variations. Their findings support the idea that there is an increase in conductivity with increasing depth beyond 250 km, suggesting a change in the Earth's composition at that depth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
