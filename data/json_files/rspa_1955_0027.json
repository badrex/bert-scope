They describe the mathematical and physical basis of these methods and discuss their application using the EDSAC digital calculating machine. The methods provide a way to calculate the reflecting properties of the ionosphere for long radio waves, helping to understand the properties of the ionosphere and its electron density.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
