They discovered that blood coagulation can be altered during blood-letting and that cold can promote coagulation. The author suggests that blood-letting should be done more frequently into small cups to better understand its effects on blood coagulation and that cooling the body may be beneficial in stopping hemorrhages.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Hematology"}
