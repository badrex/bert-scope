They calculated the effective collision diameters and discussed the intermolecular forces, such as London dispersion forces, resonant dipole effects, and quadrupole interactions, that may be important in these processes. The results suggest that further studies of this kind can provide insights into the nature of intermolecular forces and factors affecting energy transfer in collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
