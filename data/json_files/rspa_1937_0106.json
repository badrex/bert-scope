The authors calculate the critical field strength required for breakdown and discuss the interaction of electrons with the crystal lattice. They also analyze the time of relaxation and the energy transfer between the electron and the lattice, providing insights into the behavior of ionic crystals under high electrical fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
