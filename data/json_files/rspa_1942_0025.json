They discover that the staggered bond configuration is a general principle regulating bond positions in aliphatic molecules containing sequences of singly linked atoms. This principle is important for understanding the properties of substances, such as rubber, which have flexibility due to the swivelling of chain units in the molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
