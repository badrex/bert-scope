They find that the radiationless annihilation process is more probable than the radiative one, with a maximum cross-section of 1-2 cm\u00b2 for incident positrons of 100,000 volts energy. This process is important for understanding the behavior of positrons in atomic systems and has implications for nuclear physics and particle physics research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
