The author conducts experiments with dry and humid air, discussing the formation of cumuli, tropical rains, and the effects of aqueous vapor on climate. The study also addresses the role of mountain masses in condensing atmospheric moisture and the radiation observed at great elevations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
