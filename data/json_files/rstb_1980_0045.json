It explains how penicillin inhibits the transpeptidation reaction in peptidoglycan synthesis, leading to bacterial cell wall disruption and ultimately killing the bacteria. The article also highlights the identification of three penicillin-binding proteins as the primary targets for penicillin in Escherichia coli and the use of genetic mutants to study the consequences of inactivating these proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
