They use statistical methods to determine that birth order is not a significant factor in mongolism, and that maternal age is more likely to be the cause. This research helps to understand the aetiology of mongolism and the role of maternal age in its development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
