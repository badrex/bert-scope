They find that modifiers affecting the sex allocation in gynodioecious populations can invade under restrictive conditions, and that under these conditions, hermaphroditism is no longer an evolutionary stable strategy. The model considers the effects of a sex-allocation modifier on hermaphrodites and the balance of selection pressures necessary to maintain the original nuclear polymorphism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
