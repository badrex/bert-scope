G. Tait conducted experiments to study the effect of a revolving wooden disk's rotation on radiation. They used a thermo-electric pile and galvanometer to measure the radiation produced. The experiments were performed both in the open air and in vacuo. The results showed a noticeable effect due to radiation, which was nearly the same as if the disk had increased in temperature. The authors planned to continue their research on this topic and related questions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
