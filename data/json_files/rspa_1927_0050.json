The authors argue that the law does not hold true for complex mixtures containing two combustible gases with different properties. They present experimental results that contradict the law and suggest that further testing is needed before reaching a final conclusion on its validity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
