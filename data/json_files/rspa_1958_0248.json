The authors found that the sliding resistance of metals decreases as the speed increases, reaching very low values. They suggest that frictional heating causes high surface temperatures and a softening or melting of the metal at the contact points. The results show that metals with a high melting point are most effective in polishing diamond surfaces, and that the wear of diamond is due to an allotropic transformation into graphite or amorphous carbon under the influence of localized frictional heating.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
