This method includes the aberrations of the third order and provides a geometrical interpretation of the coefficients involved. The author applies this method to the Fraunhofer heliometer objective, demonstrating its accuracy and efficiency compared to previous calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
