They found that the rate constant for relaxation by atomic hydrogen has a negative temperature dependence, while the rate constant for relaxation by bulk flame constituents has a positive temperature dependence. These findings provide insights into the behavior of excited lead atoms in flames and the underlying mechanisms of curve-crossing processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
