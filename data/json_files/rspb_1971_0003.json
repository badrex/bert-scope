They explore the role of T-lymphocytes in capturing and presenting antigens to B-lymphocytes, and how this process can be influenced by hapten competition. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of cell cooperation and the immune response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
