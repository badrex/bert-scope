They found that the sensation is due to the (\u03b2 and \u03b3 rays, which cause fluorescence in the tissues of the eyeball, mainly the cornea and lens. The sensation is not directly related to the visual purple, as exposure to radium rays did not bleach the visual purple in frog or rabbit retinas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
