It discusses how penicillin inhibits bacterial cell wall biosynthesis and causes physiological consequences such as loss of viability and lysis. The role of murein hydrolases (autolysins) in penicillin-induced lysis is also examined, revealing that these enzymes become triggered in penicillin-treated bacteria, leading to cell wall degradation and lysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
