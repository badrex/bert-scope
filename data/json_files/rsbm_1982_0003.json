He was a pioneer in the field of molecular biology, focusing on the multiplication of bacterial viruses called bacteriophages. Delbr\u00fcck, along with Salvador Luria and Alfred Hershey, received the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1969 for their significant studies in this field. He inspired and encouraged many young researchers from various disciplines to work with him and contributed to the new approach to understanding fundamental biological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
