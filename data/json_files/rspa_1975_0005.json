They expand the scattering wavefunctions of the ion in a basis of two-centre wavefunctions with radial components and determine the radial components as solutions of a set of coupled radial differential equations. The cross-sections are determined by partial wave analysis, and numerical work is reported based on the expansion truncated after two terms. The phase shifts, differential, and total cross-sections are compared with experimental and other theoretical results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
