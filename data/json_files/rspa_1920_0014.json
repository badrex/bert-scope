The theory, which includes the famous Lorentz transformation equations, reveals that the laws of physics are the same for all observers, regardless of their relative velocities. The author also explores Einstein's second theory of gravitation, which modifies the space-time continuum and suggests that gravitation is a consequence of the non-Euclidean properties of space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity"}
