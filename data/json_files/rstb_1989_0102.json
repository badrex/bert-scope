The authors find that megabats share complex neural pathways with primates, while microbats have distinct features. These findings suggest that megabats evolved from an early branch of the primate lineage, while microbats have a separate origin. The research challenges the traditional view of bats as a monophyletic group and proposes a more complex evolutionary history.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
