They find that charcoal adsorbs only unionized molecules of weak electrolytes, such as propionic acid, n-propylamine, and w-butylamine. The adsorption is related to the degree of ionization of the electrolytes at different hydrogen-ion concentrations. The presence of impurities in the charcoal affects the adsorption of propionic acid, but after acid treatment, the charcoal becomes more selective in adsorbing unionized molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Surface Chemistry"}
