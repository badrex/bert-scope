The experiments supported the idea that a chemical agency is responsible for the effects produced in common electricity, similar to the power in Professor Volta's apparatus. The author also observed the production of gases and the oxidation of metals, suggesting that galvanism might differ only in quantity and intensity from common electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
