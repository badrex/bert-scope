The author applies this theory to the specific example of unsteady flow around an oscillating cylinder, focusing on wave propagation. The study finds that progressive wave types can be propagated with the velocity of sound at a stagnation point, and the amplitude decreases as the distance from the oscillating cylinder increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
