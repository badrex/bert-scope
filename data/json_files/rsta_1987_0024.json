These enzymes, particularly a family of powerful extracellular peroxidase isoenzymes, play a crucial role in breaking down lignin, a complex polymer found in plant cell walls. The author explains the key catalytic reactions of these enzymes and their mode of action in degrading lignin, opening up potential applications in various industries such as pulping, bleaching, and bioconversion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
