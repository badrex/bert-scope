They found that the acceptance angle is independent of wavelength and approaches the theoretical lower limit at 500 nm. The results support the theory that the angular sensitivity of fly photoreceptors is limited by diffraction, providing insights into the limits of resolution in insect vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision Science"}
