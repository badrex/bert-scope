It explores the processes that occurred during the formation of the Earth's crust and how these processes may have been different in the past compared to the present. The authors propose that partial melting is a necessary process in the formation of most common granulites and that the Archaean crust was significantly different from the modern crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Precambrian Geology"}
