The author clarifies the objections raised and refers to some principal experiments that discovered the properties of slow electrons. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the Ramsauer effect and its relation to the mean free paths of electrons in gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
