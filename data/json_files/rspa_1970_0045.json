They found that the overall mechanism explains the pressure and wavelength dependence of acetaldazine photolysis. The study also explored the photolysis of formaldazine, showing that the process proceeds through a similar mechanism. The research provides insights into the electronic spectra of R1R2CN radicals and the factors affecting their photolysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
