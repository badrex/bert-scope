The researchers found that both tracheid lumina and the pores in the bordered pit membranes contribute significantly to the resistance to fluid flow through the wood. The number and equivalent radii of the conducting tracheid lumina and pit membrane pores were derived from these measurements. This work provides insights into the transport of water in coniferous trees and has implications for wood utilization processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Forestry and Wood Science"}
