He discovered that the lacteals often carry liquors that are not white, and that they contain a transparent, pellucid liquid called \"Liquor Refluus.\" This finding challenges the existing understanding of the lacteals and their function in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
