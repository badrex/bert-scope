The author compares temperature readings from various locations, including the Royal Society, Royal Observatory, and other sites, to understand the influence of the river on local climate. The findings suggest that the proximity of the river causes higher winter temperatures and lower summer temperatures, contributing to the formation of London fogs.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Meteorology"}
