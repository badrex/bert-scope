They derived the vorticity equation and measured its terms using a hot-wire anemometer. The results showed that the rate of increase of vorticity due to vortex extension is proportional to the mean square vorticity, and the effect of viscosity has a similar dependence, keeping the ratio of the two contributions constant throughout the decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
