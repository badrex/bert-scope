He discusses various experiments and observations, including the discovery that the petrifying quality is not evenly distributed throughout the lake and is strongest near the area where the Blackwater River empties into the lake. Molyneux also refutes the claim that the stones turn into iron and that the wood above the water remains intact.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
