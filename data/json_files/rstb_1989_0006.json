The authors explore the mechanisms behind variable fluorescence and its relationship with energy transfer and electron transport in photosynthesis. They also investigate the quantum yield for the formation of the state in the absence of the electrostatic field generated by the reaction centre, providing insights into the role of this radical pair in generating fluorescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
