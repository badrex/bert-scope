They discovered that the dryness of oxygen affects the combustion process and chemical union takes place, but it does not manifest as flame. The author also discussed the combustion of amorphous phosphorus and charcoal in oxygen, as well as the possible origin of planetary systems through meteoric matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Element chemistry"}
