They found that the effective valency of the transition metals in the alloys varies depending on the electron-to-atom ratio and the type of transition metal. The results provide insights into the electronic properties of alloys and the behavior of transition metals in solid solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
