The transition is estimated to have lasted approximately 2000 years, and the relative field intensity decreased by at least 70% during the transition. The virtual geomagnetic poles path for the Gauss-Matuyama transition is restricted to a meridional band 20' wide in the Atlantic Ocean, indicating that the transition field associated with the reversal was dominated by non-dipole components.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
