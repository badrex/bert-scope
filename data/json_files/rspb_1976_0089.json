The researchers found that the frequency of the melanic form, carbonaria, has been decreasing in some areas due to the introduction of smokeless zones. They also examined the degree of camouflage for different phenotypes and discussed the role of predators, such as bats, in influencing the moth populations. The study provides valuable data for understanding the dynamics of industrial melanism and its relation to environmental changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolution and Ecology"}
