They improved upon previous experimental methods to obtain more accurate and uniform results. The study found that the rate of growth is related to the reticular density of the crystal faces, with higher reticular density faces growing slower. The research also examined the influence of initial crystal habit on growth rates and the possibility of polar crystals growing at different rates at their two ends.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
