They found a decrease in the bond dissociation energy along the series from CBr4 to CH2Br2, due to increasing steric repulsion between halogen atoms. The results also showed that the bond dissociation energy remained constant despite the bond length changing, suggesting a \"compression\" factor that compensates for the expected lengthening of the bond due to steric repulsion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Bonding"}
