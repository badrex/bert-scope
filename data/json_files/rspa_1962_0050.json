The authors use numerical methods to integrate the governing differential equations and find solutions for various Reynolds numbers. They discover that at high Reynolds numbers, the main core of the fluid is in a state of solid rotation for practically all values of the ratio of angular velocity of the two disks. The results show the importance of considering edge effects in any complete solution to the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
