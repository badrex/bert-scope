He discovers that these bodies consist of a mass of vessels within the dilated ends of the uriniferous tubes. He also finds that the blood passes through two distinct systems of capillary vessels in the kidney. Bowman proposes a theory of a double function for the kidney, based on his observations and other research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
