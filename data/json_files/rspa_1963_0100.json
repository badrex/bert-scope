They found that the formation of methyl ethyl ketone involves predominantly the rearrangement and decomposition of the tert-butyl peroxy radical. This research helps to understand the chemical changes occurring during the oxidation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
