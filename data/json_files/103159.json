Hauskbee, an F.R.S., conducted experiments with metal cubes provided by Dr. Sloane. He compared the specific gravities of these metal cubes to their respective volumes of water. The results showed that the cubes, when placed side by side, measured about a tenth more than six inches, and their workmanship was very accurate. This study helped in understanding the physical properties of materials and their densities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Properties of Materials"}
