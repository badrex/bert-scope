They calculate the energy of a proton in the field of a negative point charge and find that the Coulomb attraction decreases at small distances, transforming into a strong repulsion. This discovery has implications for understanding the behavior of protons and the energy shifts in hydrogen atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
