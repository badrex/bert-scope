They found that the molecule is dimeric, with each platinum atom octahedrally coordinated by three methyl groups, two carbonyl oxygen atoms of one ketoester, and the central carbon atom of the other ketoester in the dimer. This structure is similar to that of trimethyl 4:6-dioxononyl platinum and demonstrates that complex formation via a tridentate -diketo system is preferred over coordination through an ester oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
