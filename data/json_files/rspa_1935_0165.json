The authors propose a critical temperature, called the \"Curie Point,\" at which the ordered state becomes more rapid and complete. They also discuss the energy content of alloys at different temperatures, the rate of attainment of equilibrium, and the relationship between various methods of analyzing order-disorder transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
