This process involves using galvanic cells with different media, such as glass, porcelain, and clay, to transmit hydrogen and produce electricity. The author found that various metals, including platinum, can transmit hydrogen and generate electricity, with the amount of electricity produced depending on the type of metal and medium used.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
