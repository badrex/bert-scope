These oscillations occur when the pendulum is initially disturbed and can be influenced by factors such as damping and drive frequency. The study also reveals the existence of period-3 double-nodding and period-2 triple-nodding modes, showcasing the complexity of the pendulum's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
