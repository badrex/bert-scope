This principle leads to a uniqueness theorem for the Dirichlet problem for mixed equations under certain conditions on the shape of the boundary curve. The results are applicable to various domains, including those where the boundary coincides with characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
