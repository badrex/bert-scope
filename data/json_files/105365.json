The patient, who had been unable to use his right arm due to paralysis since childhood, experienced significant improvements after undergoing electrical treatments. The therapy involved using electrical shocks to stimulate muscles and nerves, leading to increased mobility and strength in the affected arm. This case study demonstrates the potential benefits of electrical treatments for patients with paralysis and other neuromuscular disorders.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology and Rehabilitation"}
