They found that the inhibitor, synthesized by enzymic action, significantly inhibits citric acid disappearance. The study provides evidence that the toxicity of fluoroacetate is due to the synthesis of a fluorotricarboxylic acid that disrupts the tricarboxylic acid cycle at the citrate stage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
