They develop a more rigorous treatment for J-coupling between like nuclei, which holds even when it is comparable to the chemical shift. This work extends previous theoretical treatments and provides generalized expressions for the frequencies and intensities of the different lines in nuclear resonance patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
