The authors investigate the role of mitochondria and plasma membrane transport in regulating calcium concentrations, and they find that mitochondria play a significant role in buffering the cytosolic calcium concentration. They also discover that plasma membrane calcium transport can be resolved into a constant slow influx, a voltage-dependent influx, and an ATP-dependent efflux.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
