They found that areas with increased numbers of linear features, such as hedges and roads, have a higher risk of disease transmission due to badger urine contamination. This suggests that badger control operations should focus on these areas to reduce the incidence of tuberculosis in cattle.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
