They discovered that the mixtures exhibit a transition point in their freezing point curve, indicating a change in the nature of the crystals. The authors also found two different types of mixed crystals with distinct melting points, which they labeled as types 'a' and 'ft'.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
