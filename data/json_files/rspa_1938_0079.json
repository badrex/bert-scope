They use a mixed specimen containing both the particles under investigation and particles of infinite size to correct for the increase in broadening caused by factors other than particle size. The method allows for more accurate particle size determinations, even in the presence of experimental uncertainties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
