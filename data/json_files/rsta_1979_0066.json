They develop an averaged Lagrangian to describe the properties of slowly varying wave trains and examine two examples of waves on large-scale currents. The results provide insights into wave behavior, including the formation of caustics and the concept of group velocity in nonlinear waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
