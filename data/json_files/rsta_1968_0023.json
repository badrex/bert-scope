It focuses on the noise associated with drawtwisting of synthetic yarns, its sources, and methods to suppress them. The author highlights the importance of reducing noise at the source and understanding the source mechanisms, transmission paths, and noise-radiating surfaces to achieve effective noise reduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Industrial Engineering"}
