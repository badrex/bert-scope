They suggest that these filaments supply oxygen to the eggs and larvae, providing a crucial role in the fish's reproductive process. This discovery contributes to the understanding of the evolution and biology of this unique species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
