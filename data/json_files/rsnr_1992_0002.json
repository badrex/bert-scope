Slare, who served as an assistant to Robert Boyle, contributed to the Society's experimental program and helped keep its experimental interest alive during a time when many of its original members had passed away. Slare's work spanned chemistry, medicine, and physiology, and he was also involved with German refugees who found refuge in England during the Thirty Years War. His contributions to the Royal Society and his unique background make him an important figure to study.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
