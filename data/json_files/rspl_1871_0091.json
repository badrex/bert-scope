The author describes various experiments and apparatus used to study the effects of electrical discharge on oxygen gas, including the use of induction tubes and Ruhmkorff's coil. The results show that the electrized gas undergoes oxidation, with the degree of change depending on the experimental conditions and the presence of other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
