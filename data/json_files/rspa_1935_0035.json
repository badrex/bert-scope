They found that the average height of the ozone layer was slightly lower at the higher latitude compared to Arosa, Switzerland. The study also showed that the ozone layer at Troms\u00f8 was more concentrated in a region centered at a height of 21 km above sea-level, while in Switzerland, the ozone was more uniformly distributed through the lower 30 km.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
