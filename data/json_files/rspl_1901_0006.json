The experiments show that these outgrowths are formed in a moist atmosphere with adequate light and heat, and they are dependent on the presence of stomata. The outgrowths are also associated with changes in the plant's metabolic activity, such as the accumulation of starch and the production of oil. These findings provide insight into the complex relationship between environmental factors and plant growth."}
