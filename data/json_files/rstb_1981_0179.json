It discusses the importance of calcium derived from intracellular and extracellular sources in coupling fluid and enzyme secretion to hormone-receptor interaction. The study also highlights the involvement of ion currents and membrane potential changes in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
