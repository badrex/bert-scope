They found that exposure to high calcium solutions damaged nerve terminals, decreased junctional potentials, and significantly reduced the sensitivity to glutamate compared to control muscles. The sensitivity to y-aminobutyric acid, the putative transmitter at inhibitory synapses, was increased. This research provides insights into the complex relationship between nerve terminal damage and the decrease in sensitivity to glutamate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
