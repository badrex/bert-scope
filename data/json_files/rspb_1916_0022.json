They discovered that the stability of the gel is determined by multiple factors and that the erosion has a diphasic character, with two minima and two maxima. The results indicate that the gel's stability can be influenced by the concentration of salts within the gel and the eroding solution. The authors also found that the addition of calcium chloride can antagonize the erosive action of sodium chloride solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
