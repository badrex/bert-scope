J. Thomson investigates the specific inductive capacity of dielectrics when exposed to rapidly alternating electric forces. He measures the wave-length of electrical vibrations produced by a condenser to determine the specific inductive capacity of the dielectric material. The results show that the specific inductive capacity is very nearly equal to the square of the refractive index for vibrations with a frequency of 25,000,000 per second, and is much less for slower rates of reversals."}
