The gas, which he did not name, contains four parts oxygen and one part chlorine. It is not an acid and has different reactions compared to other gases. This discovery challenged the understanding of acidity and the composition of hyperoxymuriates at the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Chemistry"}
