They derive the laminar boundary-layer equations and compare their results with experimental measurements, finding good agreement for the front part of the sphere. The study contributes to understanding fluid dynamics and aerodynamics of bodies of revolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
