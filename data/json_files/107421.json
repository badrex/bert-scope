The techniques involve using the principles of solving simple equations and can be applied to various types of surds, including those with indices as powers of 2, 3, 4, and more. The methods are universal and can be used to remove any number of independent surds from an equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
