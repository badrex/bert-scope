These properties make them suitable for all-optical devices. The article also introduces a new class of optical bistability caused by increasing absorption, which enables the creation of a mirrorless optical switch called the Self Electro-Optic Effect Device (SEED). The SEED has a low switching energy and is a significant improvement over other cavity devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
