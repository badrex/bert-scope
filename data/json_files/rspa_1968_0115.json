The authors derive a simple theory of free waves that considers shorter as well as longer waves and discuss their properties. They also derive a theory for free waves propagating on a shelf between two regions of constant depth and consider the limiting case of a shelf of zero width. The study reveals that shelf waves are highly dispersive and can propagate in opposite directions, with energy traveling in the sense opposite to Kelvin waves for certain wavelengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
