It explores how the cricket's nervous system forms new connections and adapts to sensory deprivation. The research shows that the capacity for correct neuronal circuit assembly is maintained throughout postembryonic development, and that removing a major input to the giant interneurons leads to a relative strengthening of the remaining inputs. Additionally, the study reveals that further rearrangements occur as a result of asymmetry during cerci development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
