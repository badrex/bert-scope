This substance, called serum fibrinogen, increases the amount of fibrin formed and prevents blood clotting when injected into a living animal. The author suggests that this substance, present in small amounts, can help explain discrepancies in previous coagulation studies and questions the power of fibrin ferment to produce so-called intoxication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Blood Coagulation"}
