It explores the differences in the mantle edge and the role of the mantle in shell formation. The research also investigates the changes in the shell fabric throughout thecideidine evolution and its implications for understanding brachiopod ancestry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Paleontology"}
