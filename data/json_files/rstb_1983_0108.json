Screening, which can occur through scattering or absorption, creates a gradient in light intensity within the organism, allowing it to detect light direction. Refraction, on the other hand, focuses light within the organism, resulting in a higher light intensity on one side. The article explores the implications of these mechanisms on plant responses to light and highlights the challenges in understanding the extent of the light gradient required for an organism to measure light direction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
