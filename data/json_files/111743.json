They find that ammonia is partly converted into nitrous acid during its passage through the body. The author also examines the effect of using phosphoric acid instead of sulfuric acid in urine distillation and its impact on nitrous acid detection. The study concludes that a delicate method is required to detect nitrous acid in urine after ammonia consumption, but it does not prove that a larger quantity cannot be lost during the extraction process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
