They find that sunspot frequency and magnetic disturbance on the same day are not directly related, but there may be a connection between magnetic phenomena on Earth and events on the Sun up to four days prior. This study suggests that further research into solar-terrestrial relations is needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
