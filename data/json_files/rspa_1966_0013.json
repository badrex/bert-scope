The continuous representation method and the multiple time scale approach are used to derive a closed integro-differential equation for the energy spectrum function, which describes the transfer of energy between wave numbers on a time scale. The results are applicable to weakly nonlinear random waves, regardless of the initial conditions and without the need for Gaussian closure assumptions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave Mechanics"}
