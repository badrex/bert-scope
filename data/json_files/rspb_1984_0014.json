The study reveals that a-latrotoxin forms channels and provides evidence for its specific mode of insertion and orientation in lipid bilayers. The channels' conductance is modulated by the direction and size of the electric potential differences across the membranes and is influenced by lipid composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
