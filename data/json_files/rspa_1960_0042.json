The authors extend their previous calculations to non-diagonal elements, providing a high accuracy over a wide range of nuclear separations for the direct transition. However, the perturbation treatment fails for the charge-transfer transition due to the importance of configuration interaction in the description of the state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
