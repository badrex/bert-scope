Graham observed the occultation of Aldebaran by the Moon using a reflecting telescope in Fleet Street. He recorded the time of the occultation, emergence, and the duration of the event, as well as the Sun's transit at noon. This observation helped in understanding the celestial events and refining the measurement of solar time.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
