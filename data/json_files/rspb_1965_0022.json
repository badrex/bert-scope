They found that after one subculture in a low concentration of Terramycin, resistance declines but remains in a state intermediate between full resistance and sensitivity. Longer exposure to the drug results in more stable resistance. The authors also examined the changes in the macromolecular composition of the cells during the first subculture in liquid medium containing Terramycin, which supports the competition between lethal and adaptive processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
