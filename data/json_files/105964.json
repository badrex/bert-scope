Horsley, attempts to determine the height of the Sun's atmosphere by comparing the height of solar spots above the Sun's surface to the height of Earth's clouds. He concludes that the Sun's atmosphere is at least 54 times the Earth's radius and possibly twice that, and discusses the implications of this finding for the pressure of the Sun's atmosphere preventing its dissipation due to intense heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar System"}
