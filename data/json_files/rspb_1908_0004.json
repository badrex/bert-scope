They used a simultaneous injection method with gelatine containing soluble colors to accurately represent the distribution of each artery. The study revealed new information about the arterial supply to various parts of the brain, including the regio subthalamica, pes pedunculi, corpus mammillare, and the nuclei of the optic thalamus. This research is important for understanding the effects of blood clotting on the brain and diagnosing brain conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
