Researchers have employed theoretical and computer-based techniques to study the behavior of high-density silicates, which are essential for understanding mantle dynamics, lithospheric motion, and plate tectonics. The study focuses on the elastic and spectroscopic characteristics of high-density silicate crystals and the simulation of phase relations and defect properties. The findings suggest that the 670 km discontinuity may not be a rigid barrier to mantle convection, and the activation energies for diffusion in forsterite and perovskite have been calculated.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
