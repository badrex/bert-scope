The stem is an upright rhizome with no true woody fibers or cambium layer, and vascular bundles are arranged like those in monocotyledons such as palms. This discovery sheds light on the relationship between Victoria regia and other monocotyledonous plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
