This enzyme acts preferentially on rapidly labeled RNA and appears to degrade it to nucleoside-5' diphosphates. Both the rapidly labeled RNA and the enzyme are apparently attached to the chromosome, suggesting that they form part of the chromosome complex itself.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
