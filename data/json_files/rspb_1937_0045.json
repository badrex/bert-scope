The research found that the ratio of luminous efficiencies of rays entering centrally and peripherally varies systematically across the spectrum. Additionally, a new color effect was discovered, providing evidence of differences in properties of the three types of receptor cells postulated in the trichromatic theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Visual Perception"}
