The cells are found primarily in the ganglion cell layer and have well-defined varicose dendrites that stratify around 60% depth of the inner plexiform layer. The study also establishes that all SP-IR cells in cat retina show GABA-like immunoreactivity, and that SP-IR amacrine cells are distinct from cholinergic amacrine cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
