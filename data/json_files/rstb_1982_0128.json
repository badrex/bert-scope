They use two independent methods, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) and quantitative video intensification microscopy (QUAVIM), to analyze the distribution of Concanavalin A-receptor complexes on cell surfaces. The study provides insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying cell locomotion, capping, and related processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
