A. Milne, where there are more unknown parameters than observations. They explore different models and assumptions to estimate the parameters, focusing on random variables and their distributions. The study provides insights into fully parameterized empirical Bayes problems and offers solutions for various cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
