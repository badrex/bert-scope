It examines the implications of this distribution, focusing on peptides such as cholecystokinin, gastrin, bombesin, and vasoactive intestinal polypeptide. The study highlights the importance of understanding the connections between the nervous and endocrine systems in the context of peptide function and regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
