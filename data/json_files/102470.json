The weather sheep, a castrated male sheep, had developed lactation and nursing instincts, allowing it to care for the lamb. The lamb was able to suckle milk from the weather sheep, which maintained it until it was weaned a month later. This unusual case highlights the survival instincts of animals and their ability to adapt in unexpected situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
