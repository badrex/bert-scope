The authors use a simulation to study the dynamics of short perpendicular-scale shear Alfv\u00e9n wave propagation in extended systems, providing insights into the coupling between distant regions of enhanced magnetospheric convection and the auroral ionosphere. The results help interpret recent satellite observations and contribute to the understanding of magnetosphere-ionosphere interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma physics"}
