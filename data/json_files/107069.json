He found that gold's specific gravity and resistance to wear change significantly when mixed with different metals. The experiments also showed that only silver and copper are suitable for gold alloys due to their minimal impact on gold's color and ductility.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
