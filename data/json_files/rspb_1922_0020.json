They investigated the growth and breakdown of fatty acids in the organism, using the inorganic medium with glucose as the carbon source. The study aimed to understand the stages of fatty acid molecule formation and their subsequent breakdown. The findings could potentially provide insights into the chemical habits of related organisms, such as the tubercle bacillus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
