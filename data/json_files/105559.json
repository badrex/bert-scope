The device works by using a wooden panel that expands and contracts based on the humidity, which is then converted into a reading on a scale. This innovation improved the accuracy of measuring humidity and was useful for meteorological studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
