The surfaces of the plasmalemma and adjacent cell wall develop various structures, which can be observed using the freeze-etching technique. These structures change during different stages of the alga's life cycle, suggesting that biological membranes have the potential to differentiate in time and space.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
