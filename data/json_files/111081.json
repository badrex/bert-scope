He constructs a formula based on the assumption that the vaporizing point of water under a given pressure is 100 degrees Celsius. Curr compares his results with the experiments of the Academy of Sciences of Paris, finding that his formula's temperatures are consistently lower.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
