The authors classify materials based on their plane-wave speeds and examine the shape of the slowness surface, which helps understand the behavior of surface waves. They also discuss exceptional transonic states, where certain waves produce zero traction on specific planes, and provide calculations for the limiting speeds of these states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
