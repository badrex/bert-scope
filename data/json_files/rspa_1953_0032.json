The authors explain that the failure of the general method in these cases is due to the degeneration of the kernel function to a constant, leading to the non-existence of the required power series expansion. They provide a simple physical example of this failure and emphasize the importance of using a non-degenerate source or excitation function for the validity of the interpretation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
