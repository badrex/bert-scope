DNA methylation is a process that imparts temporal and spatial control on gene activities in developing organisms. The author explains how DNA methylation can be studied in relation to cultured mammalian cells and how it can help clarify the silencing and reactivation of genes. The article also explores the concept of epimutations and their potential role in carcinogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
