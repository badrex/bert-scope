The authors propose a framework that explains the diverse social systems in these ants based on ecological constraints, dispersal models, and kin selection models. They suggest that high costs of solitary colony foundation and habitat patchiness promote multiple-queening, leading to different social and ecological traits in these ants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
