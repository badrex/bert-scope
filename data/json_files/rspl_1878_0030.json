They observed the reversal of spectral lines in various metals like thallium, indium, and magnesium, and discussed the effects of chemical interactions between metallic vapours on the volatility and absorption spectra. They also noted the complexity of the absorption spectrum of sodium vapour and its variations under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
