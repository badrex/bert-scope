The author uses photogeological interpretations to analyze the structures of San Cristobal, Santa Isabel, and Malaita, concluding that these islands have experienced similar structural evolution despite their different appearances. The study provides insights into the formation of these islands and their future development.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
