The author investigates the mathematical problem of covering a sphere with equal circles and shows that the conjectured solutions provide topologically similar configurations as fullerene polyhedra. The article also discusses mechanical models of fullerenes and their equilibrium shapes, as well as the connection between geodesic domes and virus research."}
