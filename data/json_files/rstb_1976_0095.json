The authors describe the capsid geometry, protein composition, and the role of specific genes in the assembly process. They propose that the capsid of #x3A6;29 is based on icosahedral symmetry and provide insights into how other viruses and complex biological structures may be assembled.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
