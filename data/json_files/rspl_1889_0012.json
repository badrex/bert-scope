The author suggests that the Earth's crust contains a source of magnetism within its outer and inner envelopes, or \"magma.\" The composition and arrangement of magnetic iron-ore crystals in this magma are discussed, as well as the thickness and depth of the magnetic magma beneath the Earth's surface. The author also examines the polarity of the Earth and how it relates to the position of the magnetic poles. The article concludes by explaining how the phenomena of magnetic intensity and the dip of the needle at different latitudes can be explained by this hypothesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
