The authors explore the connection between plate tectonics, chemical analysis, and experimental petrology in understanding the Earth's history and the processes occurring in the upper mantle. The article highlights the advancements in analytical methods, such as the electron-probe and activation analysis, and the importance of studying rocks in realistic conditions to better understand their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Plate Tectonics"}
