The research found that the total population of germ cells reaches a peak and then declines due to three distinct 'waves' of degeneration affecting germ cells at different stages. The findings provide a better understanding of human ovarian development and germ cell degeneration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Reproduction"}
