The authors develop a theory that relates to the method of statistical mechanics and provide numerical results for typical cases, including isotopic molecules like HD and D2. They also evaluate the coefficient of condensation and its dependence on temperature and the characteristic temperature of the solid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface chemistry"}
