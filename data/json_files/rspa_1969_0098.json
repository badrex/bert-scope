They replace the Thomas-Fermi atom with Hartree-Fock wave functions, allowing for different ionic sizes. The modified theory predicts stopping cross-sections for ions in amorphous carbon and channelled ions in silicon, providing a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
