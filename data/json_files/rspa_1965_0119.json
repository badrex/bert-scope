They found that the inter-ionic hydrogen bonding, dominated by the coordination around the NH3 groups and anions, plays a significant role in the structure. This study confirmed the original solution to the crystal structure and provided insights into the hydrogen bonding and molecular packing of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
