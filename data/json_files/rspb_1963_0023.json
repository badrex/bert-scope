The authors found that compounds with a /?-equatorially orientated hydroxyl group at C(3) or a hydroxyl at C(24) and a 22/?-angeloyl side-chain on the triterpene molecule have icterogenic activity. Stereoisomer specificity is shown in respect of ictero-genicity by these compounds. The authors also discovered that removing the angelic acid side-chain, substituting hydroxyl groups, or replacing them with a ketone function results in the loss of activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Triterpenes"}
