They propose that the arrangement of atoms in these crystals is due to a balance of forces and that the closest packing of spheres is a key factor in their rigidity. The study provides insights into the properties of crystals and the behavior of atoms within them.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
