They found that the plutons in accreted terrains represent mantle-derived magma that assimilated crust while differentiating at deep levels, while those emplaced into Precambrian basement are mainly derived from the crust. The regional patterns can be understood in terms of the flux of mantle magma entering the crust, crustal thickness, and crustal age.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
