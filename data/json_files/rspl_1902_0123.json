They discovered that crystal faces are not simple indices but vicinal planes slightly inclined to them, which change their inclinations during growth. The study also found that the liquid in contact with growing crystals is slightly supersaturated and has a specific refractive index.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
