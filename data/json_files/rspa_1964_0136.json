The initial product of the reaction is vinylacetylene, and other products like diacetylene, methylacetylene, benzene, and methane are formed through further reactions. The authors proposed a mechanism that accounts for the chain character of the reaction and the existence of equilibria.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
