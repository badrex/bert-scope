The theory distinguishes between two mechanisms for non-functioning: incompatibility and incongruity. The author argues that the influence of the S gene has been overestimated, and the importance of incongruity has been underestimated.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
