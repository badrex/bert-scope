They found that the presence of ATP increased the synthesis of nitrogen compounds in the nuclei. This process was inhibited by DNP and carbon monoxide, suggesting that it relied on energy derived from mitochondrial respiration. The authors concluded that energy could be shuttled between mitochondria and nuclei, even across a semi-permeable membrane, without direct contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
