The device is sensitive enough to detect changes in weather conditions and can be used as a weather clock. Molyneux also discusses potential improvements and applications of the hygroscope, such as using it to study muscle strength in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
