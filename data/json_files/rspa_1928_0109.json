They discovered that adding a drop of water to a clean solution of the sugar and solvent did not initiate mutarotation, but water containing a trace of acid or alkali acted as an efficient catalyst. The study also introduced a new phenomenon of inflected curves in the mutarotation process, which may be due to the use of highly purified materials and clean apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
