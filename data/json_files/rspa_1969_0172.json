The study assumes ellipsoidal equilibrium shapes and finds that only prolate spheroids elongated in the direction of the applied field are compatible with the moment equations of lowest order. The conditions for the onset of instability are determined from the characteristic frequencies of oscillation associated with second-harmonic deformations of the equilibrium configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
