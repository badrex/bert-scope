The research examines the calorimeter, methods for measuring gases, and the heat of formation of the explosives. The results show that the presence of mineral jelly and varying amounts of volatile matter in modified cordite affect the heat, volume of gases, and composition of the gases. The study also highlights the impact of increasing the density loading from 0.1 to 0.2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Chemistry"}
