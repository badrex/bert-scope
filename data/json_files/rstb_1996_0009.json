These pathways are distinct from the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways and play a crucial role in regulating transcription factors like c-Jun and ATF2. Understanding these pathways can help in developing therapies for inflammatory diseases and reperfusion injury.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Molecular Biology"}
