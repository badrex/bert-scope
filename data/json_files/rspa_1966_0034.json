They explore the implications of these phase shifts and the use of partial wave dispersion relations in understanding the behavior of pion-nucleon interactions. The authors also analyze the contributions of various factors, such as rescattering, long-range, and short-range interactions, in their phase shift analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
