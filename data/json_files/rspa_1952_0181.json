They proposed that isolated pairs of copper ions interact through exchange forces, forming a lower singlet state and an upper triplet state. This explanation accounts for the unusual susceptibility and paramagnetic resonance spectrum of copper acetate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
