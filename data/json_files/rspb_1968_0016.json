The researchers used yew wood and willow disks to analyze the ionic exchange and the effect of living and dead cells on the composition of the transpiration stream. The findings provide insights into the rate of base exchange and the amount of an ion bound by the exchange system in woody tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Science"}
