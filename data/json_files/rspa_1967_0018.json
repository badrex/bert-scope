The method involves adjusting the observations using the least squares method and eliminates the effect of irradiation. The results show that the Moon's mechanical ellipticity is below the critical value, allowing for an accurate determination of the differences in its moments of inertia.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
