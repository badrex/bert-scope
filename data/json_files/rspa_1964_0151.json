The author shows that a water drop becomes unstable when its length is 19 times its equatorial diameter and calculates the critical electric field, which agrees with laboratory experiments. The research provides insights into the mechanics of water drop disintegration and its role in thunderstorm formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
