The stone consists of an intimate admixture of metallic matter (nickel iron) and stony material. The specific gravity of the stone varies due to the unequal distribution of metallic particles. A partial chemical examination was made, and a complete analysis will be communicated to the society.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
