The author identifies four main types of chromatophores and examines their distribution and role in colour changes. The research also analyzes the different types of markings on the dab and their macroscopic characteristics. The findings contribute to the understanding of fish coloration and the control of colour changes in fish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Fish Biology"}
