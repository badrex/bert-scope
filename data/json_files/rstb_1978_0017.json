The researchers discovered that these fish have a unique photoreceptor structure consisting of normal rods and two types of cones. The cones are organized into rows and are closely associated with pigment cell processes. The study also suggests that the cone unit may function as a two-channel analyzer for detecting plane-polarized light.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
