The meteor appeared as bright red streamers emerging from a deep-red cloud, accompanied by extraordinary heat. It was seen in various locations, including Venice and Kilkenny, Ireland, where it caused a great ball of fire to explode, setting the area on fire. The meteor was associated with the end of a catarrh and watery diarrhea outbreak, restoring general health. Short also discusses the rarity of aurorae borealis and their potential effects on weather and animal bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
