The authors develop a constitutive framework for modeling the deformation in Brinell hardness tests, considering infinitesimal strain and workhardening elastic/plastic materials. They analyze the test's global aspects, such as the dependence on Meyer's law, O'Neill's rule, and Tabor's findings, and provide a detailed solution for the indentation of elastoplastic media by a ball. The study's results are validated through finite element computations and show excellent agreement with experimental findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
