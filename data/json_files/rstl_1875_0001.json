They describe the various stages of embryonic development, including the formation of the Gastrula, the origin of the mesoblast, and the role of the epiblast and hypoblast in the growth of the organism. This research contributes to the understanding of mollusk development and the similarities between different animal groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mollusca Development"}
