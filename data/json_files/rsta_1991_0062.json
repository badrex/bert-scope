The authors use the Mott-Littleton simulation technique to calculate solution energies for various fission products and analyze their solubility and stability in uranium dioxide. They find that non-stoichiometry significantly affects solubility, and they discuss the formation of oxide precipitates, volatile products, and the potential for stress corrosion cracking in fuel cladding materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
