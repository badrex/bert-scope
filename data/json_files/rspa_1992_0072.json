They develop a simplified model to analyze the growth process and compare it with previous numerical simulations, finding good agreement. This research contributes to understanding the mechanisms of crystal growth and the development of more accurate models for predicting material properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystal Growth"}
