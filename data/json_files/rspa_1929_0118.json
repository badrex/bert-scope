The authors examine the effects of varying surface acidity and temperature on the film's behavior, including its compressibility, cohesive forces, and equilibrium spreading pressures. Their findings contribute to a better understanding of the interactions between molecules and surfaces in colloidal systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
