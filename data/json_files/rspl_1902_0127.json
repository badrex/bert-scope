The authors analyze two sets of prominence observations to study the changes in latitude and intensity of these phenomena, concluding that prominence activity generally has a poleward drift and may not follow a consistent cycle for each solar cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
