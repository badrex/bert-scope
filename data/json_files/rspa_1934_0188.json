The authors describe their experimental methods and apparatus, and discuss the factors affecting the accuracy of temperature measurements. They find that the freezing point of platinum is a crucial point for the International Temperature Scale, and that improvements in the realization of this scale can be achieved through better understanding and control of the factors affecting temperature measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermometry"}
