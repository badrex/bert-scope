He introduces the concept of isothermal curves and curves of no transmission, and discusses the transformation of heat to motive power through changes in the volume of an elastic substance. Rankine also emphasizes the importance of understanding the total actual heat and the mechanical equivalent of heat in various types of engines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Thermodynamics"}
