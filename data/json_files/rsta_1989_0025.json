The author explains the importance of reconnection between solar and terrestrial magnetic fields and its impact on the circulation system within the magnetosphere. The article also explores the relationship between field-aligned currents and ionospheric Joule energy dissipation, as well as the effects of non-uniform ionospheric conductivity on these interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
