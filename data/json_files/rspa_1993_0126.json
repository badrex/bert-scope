They find that these forces have real and identifiable effects, and provide new formulae for calculating them. The model is used to explore the origin and structure of classical geometric forces, with implications for understanding the dynamics of complex systems in physics and chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Classical Mechanics"}
