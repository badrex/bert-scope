Neonatal skin grafts displayed longer survival times than adult skin grafts, and the authors discovered that animals accepting cheek pouch skin grafts for an extended period exhibited partial transplantation tolerance. This research provides insights into the potential for tissue grafts to induce transplantation tolerance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
