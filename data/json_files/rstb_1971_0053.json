They discovered a new polymorphic form of the protein, a double helical structure, and reconstructed the three-dimensional structure of the stacked-disk rod to a resolution of about 2 nm. The findings provide insights into the relationship between the rings comprising a disk and the structure's polar aggregation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Structural Biology"}
