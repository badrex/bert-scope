They discovered that the oleo- (or other unsaturated) groups in these glycerides are transformed into acyl groups with shorter carbon chains, such as butyric acid (C4). This research supports the idea that the presence of unusual amounts of acetic and associated lower fatty acids in the blood of ruminant animals leads to conditions in the lactating gland that favor the conversion of oleo- into short-chain glycerides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
