The authors use stochastic process theory to study the intensity and phase of the waves, and derive the probability distributions for these properties. The results show that localization leads to exponential decay of wave energy in the medium, with implications for understanding wave behavior in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Wave Propagation"}
