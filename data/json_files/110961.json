He discovered a new condition called \"electrogenic,\" which occurs after the influence of an electric current is withdrawn. This condition causes spasmodic contractions and tetanoid rigidity in muscles. The author also investigated the factors affecting this condition and suggested the presence of an unexplored voltaic principle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
