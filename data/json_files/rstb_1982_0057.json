They describe various model systems, including the gradostat and gel-stabilized systems, to investigate the behavior of microorganisms in gradients. The author emphasizes the need for a conceptual shift away from the traditional paradigm of homogeneity and highlights the importance of understanding multicellular arrays of organisms in natural ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Microbial Ecology"}
