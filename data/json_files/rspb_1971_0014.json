They discovered that three larger glycolipids are absent in transformed lines, and their levels are lower in actively growing NIL 2 cells compared to contact-inhibited cells. This suggests that the lack of some glycolipids may be important in the depression of complex glycolipid synthesis in normal or transformed cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
