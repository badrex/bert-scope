They find that many vat dyes can photosensitize the autoxidation, allowing them to use photochemical techniques to confirm the general mechanism and determine the velocity constants of individual radical reactions. The results show that the rate of initiation depends on oxygen pressure, and the rate of reaction is proportional to the square root of light intensity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
