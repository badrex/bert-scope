It discovers a specific location with a 50-fold lower methylation rate and suggests that the methylation pattern can be copied by a'maintenance methylase' at each DNA replication. This pattern may affect protein-DNA interactions and play a role in cell differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
