They calculate the retarded Van der Waals potential between the atom and the plates and discuss the extent to which the atom measures the expectation value of quantities which are quadratic in the field operators. A heuristic treatment of the effect of the plates on the Lamb shift is also provided.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
