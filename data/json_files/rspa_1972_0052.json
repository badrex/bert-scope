They discovered that polar liquids are instantly attracted to stronger regions of the field, while non-polar liquids show a time-dependent response. This phenomenon, called dielectrophoresis, is essential for understanding the differences in behavior between polar and non-polar liquids in electric fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
