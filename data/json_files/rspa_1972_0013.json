They determined the frequencies of over 3500 phonons with wavevectors in the (0001) and (hkl) planes, using a time-of-flight apparatus and a triple-axis crystal spectrometer. A force-constant model extending to eight-nearest neighbors was used to generate frequencies throughout the entire zone, providing a test of various models calculating the effective interionic forces in a metal. The results are in good agreement with experimental values and can be used to calculate the phonon density of states and Debye temperatures for specific heat."}
