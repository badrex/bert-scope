The asymptotic regime considered is that of small, a dimensionless parameter proportional to rolling speed, viscosity, and the elastic modulus. The solution provides a simple formula for minimum film thickness and displays the sharp narrowing of the lubricating film in the thin layer near the exit. The pressure-viscosity coefficient is assumed to be constant, and no pressure spike occurs in this parameter regime.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
