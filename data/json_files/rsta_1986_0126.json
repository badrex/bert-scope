The meeting covers topics such as the distribution of dark matter in galaxies and clusters, the search for weakly interacting elementary particles, and the constraints that astronomical observations place on particle theories. The discussion also highlights the role of numerical simulations in understanding the formation and evolution of the Universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
