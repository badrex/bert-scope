The researchers used microapplication of acetylcholine to test the sensitivity and found a specific, highly chemosensitive area near synaptic boutons. They also discovered that after degeneration of presynaptic neurons, chemosensitivity in extrasynaptic regions increases. This study provides insights into the distribution of chemoreceptors on neuronal membranes and the mechanisms of synaptic transmission."}
