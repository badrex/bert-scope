The authors analyze isotopic changes and alterations in meteoritic and lunar materials to deduce information on the history of cosmic-ray protons during the Solar System's formation. They also explore the implications of the absence of significant time variations in the flux and energy spectra of protons and heavy nuclei, relating to cosmic-ray sources and propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Cosmic Ray Studies"}
