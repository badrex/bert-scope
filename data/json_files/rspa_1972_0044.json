They find the critical Taylor number for the onset of instability and provide a detailed analysis of the flow's stability with respect to perturbations of different wavenumbers. The results agree well with previous variational and Galerkin expansion techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
