E. Raspe, discovered basalt hills in Hassia with unique pentagonal columns. He discusses the composition, hardness, and weight of these stones, as well as their chemical properties and the presence of tin ore crystals. Raspe considers the possible origins of these stones, including volcanic activity and watery crystallization. He also mentions the Giant's Causeway and the similarities between the basalt hills in Hassia and those found near volcanoes in Italy and Sicily.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
