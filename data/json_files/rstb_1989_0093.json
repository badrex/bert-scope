They found that certain taxa and traits are more extinction-prone than others, and that mass extinctions can remove taxa that are generally not at risk during times of low extinction intensity. This can lead to evolution being channeled in directions not predictable from patterns prevalent during background times.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
