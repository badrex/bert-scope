By assuming small variations in both host and disease, the model allows for a separation in time scales between epidemic and evolutionary processes. The resulting model exhibits rich behavior, including multiple stable states and oscillations, with the possibility of removing degeneracy by incorporating frequency-dependent selection in the pathogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Genetics"}
