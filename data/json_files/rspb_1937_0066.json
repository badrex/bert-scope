They discovered that the axoplasm has a low birefringence and that this birefringence is localized in the fibrils when fibril formation occurs. The birefringence fades away when fibril formation is pronounced, suggesting that the transition from anisotropic to isotropic fibrils results from alterations in molecular linkages important for maintaining protein micelle structure. The authors also found that good fixatives, such as alcohol and formalin, preserve the essential organization of the axoplasm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
