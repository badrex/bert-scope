They discovered that certain drugs, like physostigmine, inhibit choline-esterase by binding to the enzyme, preventing it from breaking down acetylcholine. The authors developed a method to determine the absolute activity of choline-esterase by measuring the inhibition produced by different concentrations of the inhibitor. This research has implications for understanding the role of choline-esterase in the nervous system and the potential use of inhibitors as therapeutic agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
