The authors found that the double ionization threshold causes quenching of all but one excitation series, confirming the applicability of a'spectator model' for excitation. The study provides insights into the behavior of inner shell spectra and the role of interchannel interactions in the absorption process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
