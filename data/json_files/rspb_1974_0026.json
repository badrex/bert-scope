The research focuses on the alimentary canal, musculature, and other body systems using electron microscopy and histochemical tests. The findings reveal unique features of the microvilli in the mid-gut, the organization of the muscular layers, and the presence of various proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids in the tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
