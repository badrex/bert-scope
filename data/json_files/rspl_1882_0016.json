They used two coils of copper wire and a ballistic galvanometer to determine the coefficient of mutual induction and resistance. The experiments were conducted at the Cavendish Laboratory, and the results provided a more accurate value for the ohm.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
