It derives a nonlinear Schr\u00f6dinger equation with coefficients that depend on the shear, which agrees with previous work for the case of no shear and the long-wave limit of the Korteweg-de Vries equation. The results can be used to study the stability of Stokes waves over any shear.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
