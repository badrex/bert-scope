The researchers identify six cell types and various dendrite structures, providing insights into the complex organization of the caudate nucleus. The findings contribute to the understanding of the function and connections of the striatum, a part of the basal ganglia in the forebrain.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Basal Ganglia"}
