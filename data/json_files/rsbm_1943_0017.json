He developed a method to decipher a year-chronology that reached back 15,000 years, using varves (annual layers) in the Baltic region. De Geer's work provided a precise time scale, allowing for the identification of individual varves and their correlation with glacial phenomena. His research had a lasting impact on the understanding of Earth's history and the study of Quaternary geology.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
