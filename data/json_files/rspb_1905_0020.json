They found that the skin-field and afferent nerve-trunks responsible for eliciting inhibition and excitation are the same. The study also highlights the differences in latency and summation of stimuli for the reflex inhibition and contraction. This research contributes to the understanding of the normal reflex process and the role of inhibition in muscle physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
