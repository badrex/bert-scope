The impregnation involves a sterol-protein complex, and the cuticle's chemical stability increases during the tanning process. The research also explores the effects of acids, alkali, and Diaphanol on the cuticle, revealing the sterol's role in conferring resistance to solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
