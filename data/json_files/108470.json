The author found that these currents were not caused by atmospheric electricity but rather traveled along the wires from one earth connection to another, alternating in direction. The study involved using galvanometers to measure the deflections in the wires and analyzing the results to understand the nature of these currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
