This technique allows for the study of various animal behaviors, such as bird and insect swarms, and can be applied to different field conditions. The method is demonstrated through the analysis of flight paths of lesser houseflies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
