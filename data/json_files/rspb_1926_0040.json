The research also explores the effects of copulation, X-ray sterilization, and various environmental conditions on the duration of the di-oestrous period. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the reproductive biology of mice and other mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
