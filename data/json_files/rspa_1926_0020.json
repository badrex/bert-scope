The authors found that the mobility of initial positive ions is influenced by water vapor in a similar way to negative ions. They also discovered that the transformation of initial ions into final ions is more rapid in dry air than in wet air. This research contributes to the understanding of air chemistry and atmospheric science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
