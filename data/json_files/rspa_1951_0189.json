The author assumes that the wave's amplitude is constant but that the phase varies across the wave-front. They analyze the diffraction pattern produced at the ground and show how to deduce the average magnitude of phase deviations and their lateral extent. The study also explores how investigating diffraction patterns with different wavelengths can help estimate the distance of the effective diffracting screen from the plane of observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
