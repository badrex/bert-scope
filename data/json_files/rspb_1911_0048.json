They found that connecting the peripheral segment of a divided facial nerve to a suitable motor nerve improved voluntary movement and eye closure. The spinal accessory and hypoglossal nerves were found to be the most effective substitutes for facial nerve restoration. However, association movements resulting from the use of the hypoglossal nerve can be troublesome.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology"}
