The author's result differs from Dr. Stewart's by less than 1/60,000 of the whole distance, and they discuss the potential impact of planetary disturbances on the accuracy of the calculation. The author suggests that the real distance is likely greater than their computation, but emphasizes the importance of further observations and research.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
