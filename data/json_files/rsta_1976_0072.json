The authors conducted experiments on artificial conglomerates and found that the amount of deformation experienced by pebbles depends on their yield strengths and ductility contrasts with the matrix. The results suggest that significant pebble deformation can occur during gravitational loading of sediments and provide insights into the deformation of natural conglomerates found in the Barberton Mountain Land, Transvaal, South Africa."}
