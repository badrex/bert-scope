He observed the effects of cold temperatures on mercury and the dipping-needle, a device used to measure the Earth's magnetic field. Hutchins also recorded meteorological and geomagnetic observations during his time at the fort.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
