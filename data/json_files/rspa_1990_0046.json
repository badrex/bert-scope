The theory focuses on small capillary number and small gap-to-width ratio, and it shows that fingers with relative width are possible. The study also discusses the discrepancies between the theoretical predictions and experimental results, suggesting that thin film effects play a significant role in the fingering problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
