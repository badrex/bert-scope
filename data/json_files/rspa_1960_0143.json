They extend the theory to cover the situation in a transverse magnetic field, revealing oscillatory behavior and explaining the dependence of the interaction on the relative size of orbit diameter and wavelength. The study provides insights into the positions of parts of high deformability in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid state physics"}
