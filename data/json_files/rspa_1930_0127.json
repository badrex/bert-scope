They analyze the charge and current density of atoms, determining the electric and magnetic moments, and use the wave equation to calculate the matrix elements required for the theory of the Zeeman effect. This work provides a new approach to understanding atomic physics and the behavior of atoms in magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
