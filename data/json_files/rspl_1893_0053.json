They observed that different specimens had varying hysteresis losses and that high permeability did not always imply small hysteresis losses. The authors also discussed a formula proposed by C.P. Steinmetz and compared the results of direct measurements of heat developed in magnetic reversals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
