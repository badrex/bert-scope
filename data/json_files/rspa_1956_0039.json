The authors suggest that fronts should be considered as areas of active confluence of air currents with different temperatures. They demonstrate that frontogenesis is accompanied by a vertical circulation system that can explain several features of frontal structures, such as the upward motion of warm air and the downward motion of cold air.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
