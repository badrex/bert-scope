He introduces the concept of a hyaline substance, which is present in cells and plays a crucial role in reproduction. This substance can assimilate new matter, divide, and exhibit contractile power. Barry applies this theory to the development of the ovum and the changes in blood corpuscles, showing how it is related to the formation of various tissues and organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
