They found that the absorption starts in the blue region of the spectrum and extends towards the red, while the ultra-violet and infra-red regions are absorbed before the violet. The study shows that the solution can be used to photograph the infra-red spectrum without the need for separating different orders of spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
