The author explains how PrPSc, an abnormal isoform of the prion protein, is the only known component of the prion and plays a crucial role in the pathogenesis of these diseases. The article also highlights the importance of PrP gene mutations in the development of inherited prion diseases and the use of transgenic mice to study the molecular basis of prion replication and the species barrier."}
