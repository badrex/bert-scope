C. Brodie conducted experiments on dogs to study the influence of the eighth pair of nerves on stomach secretions during arsenic poisoning. He found that after dividing the nerves, there was no watery mucus secretion in the stomach and intestines, suggesting that stomach secretions are under the control of the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
