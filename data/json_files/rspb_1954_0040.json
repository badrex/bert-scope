In good foraging conditions, bees show partial separation, while in nectar flow conditions, bees mingle without hostility. In dearth conditions, bees exhibit hostility towards strangers, driving them away or even killing them. The defense mechanisms of honeybee communities are crucial for protecting their food stores and distinguishing between friends and enemies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
