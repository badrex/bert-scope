They found that this substance is likely identical to vitamin B12. The team used various physical methods, including adsorption chromatography, partition chromatography, and crystallography, to study the substance's properties. The anti-pernicious anemia factor is sensitive to light, acid, and alkali, and it is slowly destroyed by strong oxidizing or reducing agents. This discovery led to the development of more effective treatments for pernicious anemia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
