The author, William Murdoch, explains the process of producing coal gas, its purification, and its advantages over traditional light sources like candles and oil lamps. The gas is produced from coal through distillation in iron retorts, and the gas is then stored in gasometers before being distributed to the factory. The gas is used in burners, which are either similar to Argand lamps or have a conical termination with three holes. The gas lighting is found to be more efficient, steady, and safer than other lighting methods. The author also mentions his original experiments with coal gas dating back to 1798 and its application as an economical substitute for oil and tallow.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy Efficiency"}
