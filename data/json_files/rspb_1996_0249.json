Researchers found that the wasps adjust their sex ratios in response to variation in foundress numbers, resulting in a female-biased population sex ratio. The observed foundress numbers per patch were variable, but most patches had one or two foundresses, confirming the prerequisites for the evolution of female-biased sex ratios in N. vitripennis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
