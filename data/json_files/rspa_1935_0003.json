The researchers used a porous membrane method to measure the diffusion coefficient of potassium chloride at 25\u00b0C over a range of concentrations from 0.1 to 2.0 N. The results show that the diffusion coefficient increases with concentration, and the findings are compared with previous records and theoretical treatments. This research provides valuable insights into the behavior of electrolytes in solution and has implications for understanding diffusion processes in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
