They treated the bacteria with a combination of EDTA and lysozyme, releasing an outer membrane marker and obtaining a supernatant containing cell-free type I ice nuclei. This breakthrough could lead to a better understanding of the molecular biology and biochemistry of ice nucleation and its potential applications in protein engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
