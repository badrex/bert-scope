The research finds that this current is mediated by an intracellular rise of cAMP. Acetylcholine produces a long-lasting inhibition of the isoprenaline current, which is not seen in the presence of atropine. The results support the hypothesis of the involvement of cAMP in the catecholamine-induced increase of K+ conductance in oocytes and describe the inhibition of this p-adrenergic response by muscarinic agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
