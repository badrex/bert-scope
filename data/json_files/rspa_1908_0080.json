They find that the high ratios of helium to uranium oxide in these minerals are unlikely to be caused by the minute traces of uranium and radium present. Instead, they propose that potassium may be the source of helium, as suggested by Campbell and Wood's observations on the radioactivity of potassium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radioactivity"}
