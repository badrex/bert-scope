They discover that the oxidation of thiocyanate yields a well-defined red-colored reaction front, which they study and analyze. A computer model is used to describe the traveling waves, and the results are consistent with a simple analytical treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
