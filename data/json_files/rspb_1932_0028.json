By altering the daily light ration, researchers were able to modify sexual activity in both male and female ferrets. This discovery suggests that light plays a significant role in conditioning sexual cycles in mammals, similar to its effects on birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
