They use X-ray diffraction to determine the unit cells and molecular structures of these compounds, providing insights into their crystal habits and potential applications. The study highlights the importance of understanding molecular structures in the context of crystallography and organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
