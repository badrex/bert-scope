They find that yeast cells can adapt to Janus black without forming mutants with respiratory deficiencies. The author also observes that brilliant green can cause the formation of mutants with slower growth rates. The study discusses the mode of action of these inhibitors and the character of the yeast cells' response, which varies depending on the substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Yeast Biology"}
