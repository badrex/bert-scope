By shadowing both sides of a filament, they were able to observe the front and rear surfaces and confirm the helical nature of the structure. This discovery helps to better understand the organization of these filaments in muscle tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
