The authors develop a new method to analyze and predict concentration distributions, which is more realistic than the standard diffusion equation. The simulation results show that this method is useful and versatile for studying dispersion in oscillatory flows, providing valuable insights for understanding and predicting contaminant behavior in estuaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Estuary Flows"}
