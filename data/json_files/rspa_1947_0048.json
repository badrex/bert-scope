The results indicate that the ratio generally increases with temperature and becomes constant at high temperatures. The findings support the Lennard-Jones model, which considers an inverse power repulsion superimposed on an attractive force, as a possible explanation for the observed behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
