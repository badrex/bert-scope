They examined a series of alkyl derivatives of elements, such as zinc dimethyl and cadmium diethyl, and found that the absorption spectra provided valuable information about the energies of chemical linkages and interatomic distances. The study also helped explain the mechanism and nature of primary processes in photochemical decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
