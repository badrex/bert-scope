The researchers found that in sham-operated rats, the infusion of renin and angiotensin increased the number of tracer substance particles within endothelial cells and the basement membrane. In contrast, adrenalectomized rats showed a reduced response due to impaired renal function. The study provides insights into the sieving characteristics of the glomerular filter and the modifications induced by renin and angiotensin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
