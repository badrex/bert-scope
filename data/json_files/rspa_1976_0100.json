The author presents a method to calculate the spatial dependence of the field near these caustics and cusps using the angular spectrum of plane waves and the method of double steepest descents with two complex variables. The study is applicable to radio signals from point sources entering a horizontally stratified ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
