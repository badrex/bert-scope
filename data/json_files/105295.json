It focuses on four main cases and provides three general rules or theorems to resolve them. The author demonstrates these rules using examples of spherical triangles and explains how they can be applied to plane triangles as well. The article also offers a convenient way to remember and use these rules, either by committing them to memory or noting them down in trigonometry tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
