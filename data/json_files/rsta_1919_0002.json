The research finds that the specific heat of the solute remains constant at all dilutions, and the solution lowers the mean specific heat of water by an amount proportional to the mean specific contraction of the water. This relationship helps in understanding the changes in the constitution of free water in solutions and provides a method to calculate the specific heat of solutions using densities and the known specific heat of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution chemistry"}
