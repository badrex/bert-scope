This causes tension in the outer layers, leading to cracks that form at right angles to the length of the column. The author provides a detailed explanation of how these cracks develop into the characteristic ball-and-socket or basin-like shape, and how the surrounding cooling medium plays a crucial role in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
