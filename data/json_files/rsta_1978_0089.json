The research provides a subjective account of the sediment bodies and a statistical account of their grain size compositional variability. The analysis of reefal sediments reveals distinct sediment types, including rim deposits, blanket sands, and leeward sand cays, which are influenced by various physical conditions and biological factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Sedimentology"}
