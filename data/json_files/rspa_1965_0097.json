The data support little to no violation of the rules and are in good agreement with the Cabibbo theory. The branching ratios for various hyperon leptonic decays and the observed form for decay are explained by the theory, though the data is not precise enough for a definitive test.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
