Frederic Daniell, developed a new pyrometer to measure the expansions of solids and determine higher degrees of temperature on the common thermometric scale. The instrument consists of a black-lead tube, a metallic bar, and a porcelain index. The index moves based on the expansion of the metallic bar, allowing for accurate temperature measurements. The author compares the results of this new pyrometer with previous experimentalists and finds a close agreement, establishing its reliability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
