The research proves the existence of a unique velocity potential for general bottom profiles and provides asymptotic results for different wavelength ranges. The findings extend the class of bottom profiles for which numerical results can be achieved.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
