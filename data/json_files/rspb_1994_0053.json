The results show that red wing patches reduce predation risk, as predators, mainly goshawks, attacked normal mounts more often than mounts with red wings. This finding contrasts with the assumption that bright, rare mutants suffer increased predation risk and has important consequences for the evolution of bright coloration in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
