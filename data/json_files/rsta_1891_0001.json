The author presents a new method that uses a single-layer standard coil and eliminates the errors caused by using a mercury column as the measured resistance. The results show that a single set of observations can be accurate to 1 part in 10,000, and the author believes that even greater accuracy may be achieved by maintaining consistent temperatures in the apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
