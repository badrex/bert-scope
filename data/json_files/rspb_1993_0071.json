This correlation provides an explanation for why gene density is higher in G+C rich isochores and why long interspersed elements are exclusive to G+C poor isochores. The author also discusses the role of recombination in mammalian genome evolution and the mechanisms behind it.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
