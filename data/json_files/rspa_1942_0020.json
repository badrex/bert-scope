They find that hydrogen bonds play a significant role in determining the properties of condensed monolayers, leading to condensation and solidification. The study also highlights the importance of hydrogen bonds in understanding protein structure and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
