He conducted a series of accurate lunar observations at the Royal Observatory at Greenwich to create a system for determining longitude based on the Moon's motion. Although his method was not widely adopted, it laid the groundwork for future advancements in lunar and celestial mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
