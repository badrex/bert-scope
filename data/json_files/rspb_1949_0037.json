They discovered that subcutaneous transplants of coagulating gland and seminal vesicle could produce fructose and citric acid, even in complete anatomical separation from the male reproductive system. The formation of these metabolites is controlled by the male sex hormone, and the ability to form fructose is restricted to grafts from coagulating gland, while those grown from combined tissues produce both fructose and citric acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
