Godel's most famous work, the Incompleteness Theorem, refuted prevailing foundational theories of the time and established the potentialities of different axiomatic definitions in mathematics. His work has had a lasting impact on the field, influencing model theory, recursion theory, and set theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mathematical Logic"}
