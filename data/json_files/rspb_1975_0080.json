They discuss a model that incorporates competition and graded affinity between axons and postsynaptic sites, which they tested through computer simulations. The study shows that competition between axons and postsynaptic sites is crucial for map-making, and it can lead to spreading or compression of connection patterns in spatial mismatch experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
