They observed the low-frequency region in the spectrum and made some observations on the CH stretching modes in poly-L-alanine. The results provide insights into the structure and properties of these polypeptides and their relationship to silk fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
