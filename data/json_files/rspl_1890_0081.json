The authors found that the solubility of zinc in bismuth and tin, and bismuth in zinc and tin, increases with temperature. They also discovered that the solubility curves for these alloys lie below the base line, unlike lead-zinc-tin alloys. Additionally, the authors studied the behavior of bismuth, zinc, and silver alloys, finding that two definite compounds of zinc and silver are formed under specific conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
