A complete asymptotic theory is developed for the case when the parameter, which measures the ratio of latent heat to sensible heat, is large. The study provides uniformly valid approximations to the solution for all time, up to the instant when the material is completely frozen.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
