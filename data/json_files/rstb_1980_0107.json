They found that the three species of Bicosta exhibit characteristic differences in responses to environmental pressures, with B. minor being the most tolerant of temperature variations. The study provides new insights into the structure of the membrane subtending the protoplast and its attachment to the lorica, as well as revised taxonomic descriptions for the species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
