The asymptotic analysis demonstrates that, in addition to the inviscid mode found by Gregory, Stuart & Walker, there is a stationary short-wavelength mode. The study explains why the inviscid approach should give a good approximation to the experimentally measured orientation of the vortices and provides a starting point for the corresponding nonlinear problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
