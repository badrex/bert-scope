They found no significant genetic differences between cuckoos from various hosts, suggesting that egg color variation may be facultative or that gene flow between host-specific groups is high. This study helps to understand the coevolutionary interactions between hosts and parasites in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
