The study focuses on finite rank laminates and uses the Hashin-Shtrikman variational principles to obtain optimal bounds on the effective elastic tensors. The results provide insights into microstructures that represent the stiffest or most compliant response for orthotropic composites.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Composites"}
