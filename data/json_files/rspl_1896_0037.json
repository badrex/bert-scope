They found that the average frontal breadth of the crabs decreased, while the right dentary margin increased during this time. The author suggests that this may indicate a permanent change in the species or a temporary oscillation in their dimensions, and recommends further measurements to determine the cause.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
