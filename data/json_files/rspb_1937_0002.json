The researchers discovered that the pigment alizarin varies significantly in amount across different species and strains, while purpurin-3-carboxylic acid is consistently present in the roots of Galium species. The findings suggest the potential for using chemical differences to create strains with distinct characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
