They identify numerous deviations from the ordinary human muscle structure, including the presence of a levator claviculce, a costo-fascialis cervicalis muscle, and a brachio-fascialis. These findings provide insights into the relationship between muscular aberrations in different parts of the body and their potential implications for human physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Anatomy"}
