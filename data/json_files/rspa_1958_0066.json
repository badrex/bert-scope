They found that nitric oxide consumption and cyanide production depend on the reaction conditions. A possible chain mechanism for nitric oxide consumption and cyanide production is proposed, which explains the experimental results. The study provides insights into the catalytic effects of nitric oxide on the decomposition of diethyl ether, ethanol, and acetaldehyde.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
