The authors propose a three-way partition of the temporal structure of speech based on dominant temporal fluctuation rates: envelope, periodicity, and fine-structure. They discuss the acoustic, auditory, and perceptual correlates of these features and their impact on segmental cues to manner of articulation, voicing, vowel identity, and prosodic cues.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Speech and Language Processing"}
