They found that the blue-green and ultra-violet bands form a single system with the state as the lower level. The upper state,, has an unusual structure with significant spin-spin interaction. The authors suggest that it arises from a mixture of two or more molecular orbital configurations, and discuss the interaction of the and states, which may be responsible for the observed irregularities in the state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
