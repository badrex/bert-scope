They discuss various ways to solve these equations, including using spherical harmonics and arbitrary functions of time. The author also applies this method to problems like radiation passing through an aperture and the decay of electric vibrations in a condenser.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
