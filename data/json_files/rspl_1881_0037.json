The authors found that these substances cause prolonged contractions and increased viscosity in muscle fibers. They also discovered differences in the effects of various salts of ammonia on nerve and muscle responses. The study provides insights into the physiological mechanisms of these substances and their potential applications in medical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
