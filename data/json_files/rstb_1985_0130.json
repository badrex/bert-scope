The research focuses on the upper stratified water, which shows intense biological activity and distinct characteristics compared to the rest of the water body. The authors use various statistical methods, including parametric and non-parametric analyses, to understand the ecosystem's structure and dynamics. The findings provide insights into the differences in biological activity and the importance of variables in different water masses.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
