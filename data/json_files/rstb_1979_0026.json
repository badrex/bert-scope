The researchers monitored the breakdown stages of 31 tortoise remains for up to 18 months, identifying eight recognizable stages in the decomposition process. They also observed the activity of various scavengers, such as dipteran larvae, ants, crabs, and birds, which play a significant role in the initial decomposition of the tortoise remains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
