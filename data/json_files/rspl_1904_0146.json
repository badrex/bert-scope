They discovered that exposure to radium rays causes the crystals to change color from yellow to red and reduces their phosphorescence. The change is permanent and not due to chemical decomposition or loss of water of crystallization. The author suggests that the change is similar to the phase transition from crystalline to amorphous states in metals when subjected to mechanical stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
