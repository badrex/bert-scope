This solution is regular throughout the interior and smoothly joins the Schwarzschild exterior solution. The new solution allows for the radius to take values arbitrarily close to the gravitational mass of the sphere, unlike the original Schwarzschild interior solution. Under certain conditions, the new solution can be interpreted as the field inside an Einstein cluster."}
