By analyzing the amount of helium generated over time, the author aimed to estimate the antiquity of these minerals and validate the method of calculating geological time based on radioactive properties. The results provide insights into the rate of radioactive decay and the formation of helium in minerals, contributing to the understanding of Earth's geological history.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochronology"}
