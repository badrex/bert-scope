Gassiot presents two inventions by John George Appold: an automatic temperature regulator and an automatic hygrometer. These devices help maintain a comfortable temperature and humidity in buildings without the need for steam power. The temperature regulator uses a glass tube filled with mercury and ether, while the hygrometer employs a similar mechanism with bibulous paper to control moisture levels. These inventions could be used in private homes to improve the health and comfort of inhabitants.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Home Automation and HVAC"}
