The author discusses the role of sedimentary matrix compressibility and plant tissue collapse in determining the form of fossils embedded in it. The article classifies fossil plants into petrifactions, compressions, impressions, and compactions, and suggests the term \"compressions\" for plants with modified external forms due to vertical pressure from surrounding sediments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
