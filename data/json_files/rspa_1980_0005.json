The authors establish thermodynamic restrictions and analyze the behavior of these fluids under various conditions, including the case when the Clausius-Duhem inequality is satisfied but the Helmholtz free energy is not at a minimum in equilibrium. They also study the stability of non-trivial base flows and provide uniqueness theorems for initial-boundary value problems and slow steady flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
