It examines the total content of trace elements in Scottish arable surface soils and compares it with the ranges in soil-forming rocks and crustal averages. The article highlights the importance of understanding trace element mobilization and uptake in relation to soil parameters and plant species, as well as the need for systematic soil surveys to assess trace element status.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Chemistry"}
