The author describes various methods of manufacturing mercurous sulphate and amalgams, as well as the process of creating the depolarising paste. The article also highlights the importance of paying attention to the percentage of cadmium in the amalgam and the need for a constant E.M.F. towards a cadmium sulphate solution for a given temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
