They found that after crossing the nerve supply of flexor and extensor muscles, the animals regained the power of performing voluntary co-ordinated movements. The study also showed that the cerebral cortical centres can interchange their positions and retain their irritability after nerve crossing. Additionally, the author successfully treated a patient's facial spasm by grafting the facial nerve onto the spinal accessory nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
