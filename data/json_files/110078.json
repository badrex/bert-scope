The author analyzes the differences in parallax between y Draconis and \u03b1 Lyrae, as well as the absolute parallax of \u03b1 Lyrae. The study highlights the imperfections in observations and the uncertainty in the mean, leading to inconclusive results about the actual magnitude of the annual parallax.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational astronomy"}
