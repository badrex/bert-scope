The authors demonstrate that most visible cracks are artificial, while only a few long cracks may be real and significant. They also propose two possible mechanisms for crack formation: the boric-oxide anomaly and differential contraction due to sodium diffusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
