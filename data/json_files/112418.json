They identify two minerals: a green mineral with a prismatic system and a crystalline form similar to olivine, and a second mineral that may be silica in its allotropic condition and lower density, possibly tridymite. The study provides insights into the composition and structure of meteorites and the minerals they contain.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
