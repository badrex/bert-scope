They found that glutamic acid was converted into aspartate, gamma-aminobutyrate, glutamine, and carbon dioxide. The presence of glucose and pyruvate significantly increased the formation of glutamine and gamma-aminobutyrate from glutamate. This study highlights the similarities between brain and retina metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
