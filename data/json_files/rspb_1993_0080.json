The authors propose a four-step process in which symbionts invade and spread through host populations, leading to the establishment of nuclear mutants that prevent cytoplasmic inheritance in certain gametes. This process eventually results in the formation of two sexes, one that transmits the cytoplasm and another that eliminates it. The mechanism is a feasible explanation for the origin of two sexes in eukaryotic organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
