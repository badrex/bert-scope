They show that horizontal winds due to these tides cause electrons to move along the lines of the Earth's magnetic field, resulting in a vertical motion. The theory is used to explain high ionization densities in low latitudes, high values at noon near the equator, and afternoon and nighttime increases in ionization at certain locations. The authors also present observational evidence of solar tides in the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
