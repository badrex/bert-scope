They discovered that 4:4'-dihydroxy-diphenyl methane is the most potent member of the series and that the presence of a phenyl nucleus reduces its efficacy. The study also found that the introduction of methyl groups in the 3:3' positions can diminish the potency of some substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
