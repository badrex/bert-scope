The author examines the differences in shell patterns between European, Levantine, and eastern species, and explores the correlation between shell structure and the snails' soft parts. The study provides insights into the parallel evolution of three distinct lines of Viviparid\u00e6 and the role of environmental factors in their development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Mollusks"}
