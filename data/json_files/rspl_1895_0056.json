They found that the proportion of argon to nitrogen remains nearly the same even when the air has been significantly altered by respiration. This suggests that argon, like nitrogen, does not play a significant role in the animal economy other than as a diluent.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
