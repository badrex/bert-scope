The authors suggest that the east Shetland coast acts as a diffraction grating for long waves, trapping them in a pattern of standing edge waves concentrated in the coastal zone. The occurrence of these waves is associated with the passage of fast-moving meteorological fronts across the northern North Sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
