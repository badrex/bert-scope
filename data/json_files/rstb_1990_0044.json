FGF, along with other heparin binding growth factors, can induce ventral mesoderm formation in ectoderm cells. The competence of ectoderm cells to respond to FGF increases from the 128-cell stage and declines by the onset of gastrulation. This process is crucial for the proper development of various tissues and structures in the Xenopus embryo.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
