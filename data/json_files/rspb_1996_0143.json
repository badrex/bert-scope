They found that the male courtship behavior was influenced by the combination of stimulatory and inhibitory pheromones produced by live sex-mosaic flies. The study highlights the role of these substances in their structure, sexual specificity, and evolutionary function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ethology"}
