The authors use a theoretical description and shape assumptions to analyze the development of these structures and their energy transfer mechanisms. They find that large-scale structures first appear in the streamwise direction and subsequently decay, while the control of these structures can be explored through adjustments in the energy of fine-grained turbulence and changes in initial velocity profiles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
