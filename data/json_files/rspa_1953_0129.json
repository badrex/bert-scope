They obtained isotherms for different hydrocarbons, alcohols, and other sorbates, revealing hysteresis associated with nucleation and recrystallization of the host crystals. The sorption process involved lattice penetration and structural rearrangements, forming complex structures similar to the 'quarter-hydrate' and 'hemi-hydrate' phases. These structures exhibit zeolitic properties, with non-stoichiometric proportions of sorbate to sorbent and apparent saturation values that decrease with rising temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
