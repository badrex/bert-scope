The study reveals various types of interactions and mechanisms that lead to stable coexistence, including resource partitioning and a novel interaction called contramensalism. The findings emphasize the complexity of simple environments and the importance of understanding different stabilizing mechanisms in maintaining coexistence among competing species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
