Gassiot, conducted extensive experiments with a water battery consisting of 3520 pairs of copper and zinc cylinders to study the electrical and chemical actions within the voltaic circuit. Gassiot discovered that a distinct spark could occur before the completion of the circuit and that the water battery could maintain this action for several weeks. The study also focused on the importance of insulation in the battery's performance and the various static and dynamic effects observed during the experiments."}
