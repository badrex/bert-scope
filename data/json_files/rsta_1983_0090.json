The article explores how these theories attempt to explain the values of fundamental constants, such as the fine structure constant and the weak interaction scale. Supersymmetry is presented as a promising approach to understanding the weak interaction scale and potentially unifying it with gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
