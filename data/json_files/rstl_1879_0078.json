They discovered that gases possess a heterogeneous structure, meaning they are not a continuous plenum, and found a law that explains the differences in transpiration rates through plates of different coarseness. This discovery provides an experimental demonstration that gas is not a continuous substance and supports the molecular theory of gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
