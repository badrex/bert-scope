It demonstrates how these functions can be used to solve problems involving the ratios of solutions of the differential equation without the independent variable. The paper also shows how to express the connection between three solutions of a linear differential equation of the third order in terms of these functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
