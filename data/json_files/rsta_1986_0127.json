The presence of hidden matter is suggested by the rotation of galaxies, the virial theorem in galaxy clusters, and cosmological arguments. The article explores the possibility that this hidden matter could be non-baryonic, meaning it is not made up of ordinary matter like stars, gas clouds, or atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
