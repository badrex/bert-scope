They used solvent extraction with organic solvents to analyze the metal content and discovered the presence of metalloporphyrins, which are thought to be derived from the chlorophylls and haems of the biological precursors of coal. This research has implications for coal liquefaction processes and the search for alternative sources of products previously derived from crude oil.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
