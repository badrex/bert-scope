The authors compare different theories to explain the atomic heat and find that Debye's theory provides the closest approximation to experimental results. They also study the solid condition of alloys containing not more than 5% aluminum and observe the formation of uniform solid solutions and complex alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
