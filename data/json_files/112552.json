W. Hofmann, describes the transformation of aromatic monamines into acids richer in carbon, focusing on the synthesis of menaphtylamine. He explains the process of preparing menaphtylamine from nitriles and thiocompounds and discusses its properties, such as its crystalline tendencies and reactions with other chemicals. Hofmann also mentions his plans to investigate other sulfur compounds and shares his findings on the identity of acids obtained from different processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
