The authors propose a model to explain these effects, considering the behavior of electrons and positive holes in bismuth under external magnetic and electric fields. The results show a strong dependence on the magnetic field strength and temperature, and the model's predictions are compared with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
