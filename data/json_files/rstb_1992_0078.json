It emphasizes the importance of studying responses to biologically important sounds, information-bearing elements, and tone bursts. The author also highlights the need for systematic variation of information-bearing parameters and the measurement of tuning curves for excitatory, inhibitory, and facilitative responses. Additionally, the article stresses the significance of exploring level-tolerance and interactions among excitation, inhibition, and facilitation in creating selectivity within neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
