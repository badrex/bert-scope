He suggests that such events could have reduced a previous world to chaos, from which the current world was formed. Halley also considers the potential benefits of such catastrophes for the well-being of future worlds, as they could help bury indurated substances deep within the Earth, allowing for new growth and life. He acknowledges the controversy surrounding his ideas and notes that they were not intended for publication, but were included at the request of a late committee of the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
