The two 4-hectare plots analyzed contained 511 species in 164 genera and 59 families, with 51% of species being rare and 31% having only one tree. The forest's dominance by Euphorbiaceae, along with high contributions from Lauraceae and Meliaceae, may reflect special site conditions and/or a late stage in recovery from past disturbance.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
