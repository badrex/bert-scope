The author demonstrates that the demarcation current is influenced by the salt content in the nerve and can be affected by external factors such as tap water and saline solutions. The author also suggests that the demarcation current may be caused by a balance between two unequal osmotic processes at the cross section and longitudinal surface of the nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nerve Physiology"}
