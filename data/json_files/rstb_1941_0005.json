It demonstrates muscular continuity between the cardiac chambers and the absence of specialized muscle or 'nodal tissue' at the junctional sites. The research also examines the intrinsic rhythmic rates of the cardiac chambers and the significance of these findings in relation to the phylogeny of the conducting systems of mammalian and avian hearts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
