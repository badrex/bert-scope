The first instrument uses electrical principles to register the direction of deep-sea currents and the temperature of the sea at various depths. The second instrument measures the velocities of deep-sea currents using a wheel exposed to the water's free action. Both instruments aim to improve our understanding of ocean currents and their impact on marine life and weather patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
