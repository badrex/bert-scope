The research reveals that the testis size increases during the breeding season due to the growth of testis tubules, interstitial cells, and blood supply. The study also discusses the variations in the diameter of the seminiferous tubules and the process of spermatogenesis during different stages of the reproductive cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
