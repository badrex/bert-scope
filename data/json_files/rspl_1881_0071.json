They discovered that the absorption of radiant heat by gases and vapors is the same as that of liquids, and that the expansion and contraction of these substances due to the absorption and release of heat can generate musical sounds. This research helped to disprove the \"vapour-hesion\" hypothesis and provided insights into the behavior of gases, vapors, and liquids when exposed to radiant heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
