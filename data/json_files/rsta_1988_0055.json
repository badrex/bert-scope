The slide extends for over 800 km and involved approximately 5600 km\u00b3 of sediment. The slide is believed to have been triggered by earthquake loading and the decomposition of gas hydrates, causing liquefaction of the sediments. The slide has significant implications for understanding the geological processes and hazards associated with large-scale submarine landslides.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
