The research focuses on the micro- and macro-gametocytes, their nuclear and cytoplasmic changes during gametogenesis, and the process of fertilization. The findings provide insights into the biology of malaria parasites and contribute to the understanding of their life cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
