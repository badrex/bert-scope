The researchers used patch-clamp techniques on chick embryo myotubes and found that substances like 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA) and exogenous phospholipase C altered the conductance and gating behavior of the ACh-activated channel. They propose that acetylcholine regulates its own receptor-channel through PKC stimulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
