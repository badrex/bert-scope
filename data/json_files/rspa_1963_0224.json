The results show that bromine compounds have a promoting effect on combustion under conditions where they are converted to hydrogen bromide or bromine. However, they inhibit the oxidation of methane and formaldehyde. The authors suggest that the opposing influences of bromine on combustion processes can be attributed to its direct reaction with oxygen or its interaction with intermediate peroxides, leading to enhanced chain-branching.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
