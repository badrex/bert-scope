They confirmed the occurrence of haemoglobins in the perienteric fluid and body wall of the worms and determined their absorption spectra. Both haemoglobins exhibit a remarkable resistance to deoxygenation, which is due to a low deoxygenation velocity. The study provides insights into the metabolic processes and oxygen requirements of the parasitic nematodes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
