They calculate the Stark effect in weak electric fields and provide a formula for the quadratic effect when the Stark splitting is small compared to the separation between levels. This work builds upon previous calculations by Schlapp and Rojansky and is relevant to understanding the behavior of atomic spectra in the presence of electric fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
