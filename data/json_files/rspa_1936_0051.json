They discovered that the energy release in this process is 8.6 MeV, which is in agreement with other nuclear reactions. The study also revealed that the disintegration of boron into three alpha particles is a rare event, and the energy distribution among the products has not yet been fully explained. This research provides valuable insights into the understanding of nuclear reactions and energy release.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
