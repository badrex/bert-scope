They propose that the extinction of one predaceous tribe was compensated by the creation of new genera and species with similar appetencies. The author also notes a curious coincidence that marine Trachelipodes of transition and secondary strata are mostly genera with opercula, while unoperculated genera are found in tertiary formations where Ammonites disappear.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
