The results show that birds have a more efficient pulmonary system than mammals, with higher surface area of the blood-gas barrier, greater pulmonary capillary blood volume, and higher morphometric pulmonary diffusing capacities. These adaptations help birds meet the high energetic demands of flight and other activities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy and Physiology"}
