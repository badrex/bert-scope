They found that there is a maximum wave-length for a specific filament current, and the wave-length and amplitude of oscillations decrease when the filament current is increased beyond this value. The authors also discovered a correlation between the resistance of the circuit and the wave-length and amplitude of oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
