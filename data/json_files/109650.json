The author, Alexander Marcet, found that the water of the Dead Sea contains high levels of salt, specifically muriates of lime, magnesia, and soda. The water of the River Jordan also contains some saline matter, leading the author to suggest that the river might be the source of the salt in the Dead Sea or that they share a common source of impregnation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
