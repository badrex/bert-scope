The skeleton of this extinct species helps to understand the ancestry of other Paridigitata and offers a clue to the skeletons of their predecessors. The author also proposes a new zoological classification system for the Ungulata, separating Paridigitata into two distinct lines of descent based on dental and skeletal characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
