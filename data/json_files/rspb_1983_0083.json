The researchers discovered that the parasite uses a unique hypodermic impregnation method to transfer sperms, where the penis grasps and perforates the tegument of a co-copulant, and sperms are deposited in vitelline spaces or other unusual sites. This method is different from other monogeneans that use a vagina or spermatophores for sperm transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
