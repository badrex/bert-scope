The model combines the Maier-Saupe theory of conventional liquid crystals and the worm concept of semiflexible polymers. The study allows for both qualitative and quantitative conclusions about the shape and gradients of phase diagrams, predicting triple points and a critical point inside one of the nematic phases. The occurrence of re-entrant nematic phases is identified as a consequence of the main-chain flexibility.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
