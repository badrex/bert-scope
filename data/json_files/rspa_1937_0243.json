The author examines the mechanisms of ion loss, including recombination of oppositely charged ions and attachment of electrons to neutral molecules. The study aims to provide a deeper understanding of the physics of the ionosphere and explain the observed variations in ionization density.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
