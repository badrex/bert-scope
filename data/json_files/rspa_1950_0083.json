The authors measured flame temperatures using the sodium line-reversal method and found that the Saha equation, relating equilibrium ionization and flame temperature, can explain the observed behavior in flames. However, side reactions involving halogen ions and hydrogen atoms affect the electron content, leading to some degree of disequilibrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Equilibrium and Reaction Kinetics"}
