The author explains that extensional tectonics occur in four regions: Tibet, the Baikal rift system, the Shansi graben, and Yunnan. The article also explores the different mechanisms responsible for the extension in these regions and their relation to the convergence between India and Eurasia.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
