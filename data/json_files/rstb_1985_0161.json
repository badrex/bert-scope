The study uses electron spin resonance (ESR) to investigate the damage inflicted by radiation on nucleic acids and their components. The article highlights the selectivity of attack and reactions that lead to fragmentation, providing insights into the mechanisms of radiation-induced damage in DNA and RNA.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radical Chemistry"}
