They found that only the main component and satellites Nos. 6, 7, and 8 of the mercury green line were completely absorbed by the luminous vapor, while other satellites remained unaffected. This study provided insights into the constitution of the green line A and the behavior of different isotopes of mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
