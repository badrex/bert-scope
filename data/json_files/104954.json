They observed that the substance was composed of many thin, hollow, star-shaped animals with unique structures. These animals had a different structure than polyps and were found surrounding the stem of a type of seaweed called fucus teres. The authors believe that each star-shaped animal is a distinct organism and are currently studying their life cycle and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
