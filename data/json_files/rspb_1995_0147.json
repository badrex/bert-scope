The authors propose that both host factors and parasite virulence play a role in determining disease outcomes, and that their combined effects can explain intriguing epidemiological observations, such as the reduction in severe malaria incidence in certain host genotypes without a concomitant reduction in mild disease. The authors use a mathematical model to explore the coevolutionary consequences of host resistance and parasite virulence in malaria transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
