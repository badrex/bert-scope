They found that venous blood contains carbonic acid and that it can absorb this gas without being exposed to the air. The author also discovered that the air-pump can remove carbonic acid from the blood, and that hydrogen has the ability to remove carbonic acid through a membrane. These findings contribute to the understanding of respiration and blood circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
