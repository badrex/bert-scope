The sculpture depicts Mithras, a figure from ancient Roman religion, performing a sacrifice and represents the sun. The discovery sheds light on the Mithraic ceremonies and their connection to the patriarchal religion and early Christianity. The authors suggest that the Mithraic rituals and symbols predate Christianity and were a part of the ancient, patriarchal worship of the true God.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
