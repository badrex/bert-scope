This approach simplifies the process of solving the equation for compressible fluids and shows that the interaction between magnetic fields and fluid velocity is governed by just one coupling integral. The new method also provides a more concise way to evaluate coupling integrals and offers a better understanding of the selection rules and symmetries involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
