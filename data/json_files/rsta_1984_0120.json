They demonstrate that many important features can be determined without knowing the electric fields in the nonlinear media and show that asymmetric modes occur both in linear and nonlinear structures. The study also explores the possibility of optical hysteresis and bistability in these structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
