They found that the rate of fermentation of glucose by yeast juice is greatly increased by the addition of a soluble phosphate. The compound undergoes some alteration during fermentation, and a combination of the phosphate with the sugar, forming a phosphoric acid ester, is suggested to have taken place. The study provides insights into the metabolism of sugars and phosphates in yeast.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
