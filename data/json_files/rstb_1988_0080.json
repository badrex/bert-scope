It highlights the importance of understanding the distribution of signaling components within the cell and the role of localized second messenger domains. The article also explores the dynamic nature of calcium oscillations and their potential function in encoding information and controlling intracellular calcium regulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
