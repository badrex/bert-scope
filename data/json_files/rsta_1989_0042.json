The authors find that a uniform mantle composition is incompatible with existing data, suggesting that the mantle is stratified with the upper and lower mantle convecting separately. The compositional density difference between these regions is estimated to be about 5.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
