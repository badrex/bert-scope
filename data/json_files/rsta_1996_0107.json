RHETs are quantum functional devices that use resonant tunnelling barriers between the emitter and base, allowing for faster and more efficient electronic devices. The authors describe their development of multi-emitter RHETs, which have the potential to replace conventional semiconductor devices in the future. They also discuss potential research directions, such as developing room temperature quantum functional bipolar transistors and quantum box devices based on RHET technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nanoelectronics"}
