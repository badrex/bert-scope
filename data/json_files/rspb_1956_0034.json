The experiments show that eyeless Daphnia exhibit a photokinetic response, including an inhibition of movement at high light intensities, but no phototactic response. This suggests that other photosensitive systems, rather than the compound eye, are involved in controlling the photokinetic activation and inhibition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
