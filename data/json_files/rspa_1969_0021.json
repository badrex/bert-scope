These measurements were used to assess current theoretical treatments and interpretations of electronic structures and interionic forces in ionic crystals. The findings provide insights into the nature and magnitudes of ionic distortions and their influence on the energies of optical and acoustic phonons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
