The research examines the transition from the continental crust to the oceanic crust and provides insights into the mechanisms of lithospheric extension and the formation of rifted passive margins. The findings reveal a zone of transition about 8 km wide, with the continental crust thinning from 33 km to about 5 km near the transition zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Seismic Studies"}
