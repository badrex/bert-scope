They measured the reflection coefficient, which increased with frequency in the partial contact region. A spring model was used to predict the reflection coefficient variation, showing good agreement with experimental results. The study also explored the use of ultrasonic waves to investigate contact between surfaces under loading and unloading cycles, providing insights into the real area of contact and interfacial stiffness.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
