The authors discuss the Korteweg-de Vries equation and its role in developing new ideas and connections between mechanics, spectral theory, Lie groups, and algebraic geometry. They also explain how specific systems and equations have led to general schemes in the realm of Lie algebras, which manufacture completely integrable Hamiltonian systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
