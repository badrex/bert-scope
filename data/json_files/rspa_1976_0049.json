They generalize Penrose's surface integral formalism to curved space-time and apply it to massless spin fields obeying the equation. The procedure is used to define the total electromagnetic field experienced by the particle and is compared with action-at-a-distance theories. The authors also discuss the effect of space-time singularities in action-at-a-distance theories and the application of their procedure to the Newman-Penrose conserved quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
