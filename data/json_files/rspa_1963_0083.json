They demonstrate the relation between fundamental solutions of the wave equation and singular integrals of parametric plane waves. The study covers point sources with various velocities, fixed and moving sources with step-function time dependence, and the effects of the plane interface.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
