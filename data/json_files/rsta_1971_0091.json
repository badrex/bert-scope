The tidal records are compared with data from Ascension, Trindade, and Tristan da Cunha Islands, as well as a nine-year series from Simons Bay, South Africa. The research explores the origins of swell waves, or 'rollers,' in the South Atlantic and investigates island-trapped waves around Saint Helena. The findings contribute to a better understanding of oceanic motions and the behavior of tides and waves in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
