It discusses well-known properties of point groups, such as the invariant subgroups and the theory of poles of finite rotations. The author demonstrates that all crystallographic point groups can be expressed as a semi-direct product of one of their invariant subgroups by a cyclic subgroup. This approach simplifies the use of symmetrizing and projection operators required to obtain symmetry-adapted functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
