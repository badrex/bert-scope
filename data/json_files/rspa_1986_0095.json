They found that the dislocation loops were prismatic and interstitial in nature, and that the voidites were formed by the decomposition of the platelets. The results suggest that the diamond may have been subjected to a drop in pressure at high temperature, causing platelet decomposition and the generation of voidites.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography and Defects in Materials"}
