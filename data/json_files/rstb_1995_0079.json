The researchers found abundant distribution of the peptide in various parts of the brain, thoracic and abdominal ganglia, and the midgut. The peptide is present in interneurons in the central nervous system and may play a role in controlling foregut and midgut contractility.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurophysiology"}
