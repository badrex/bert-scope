The researchers found that females have discrete sperm storage organs, and that females who engage in'stealing a guard' behavior have a higher genetic diversity of stored sperm than those who mate and are guarded. This suggests that females may have the potential to exercise post-copulatory choice based on the observed patterns of sperm precedence, genetic variation in stored sperm, and the avoidance of remating in some cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
