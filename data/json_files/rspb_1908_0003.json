The authors found that older workers and those with higher body weight were more likely to be affected by decompression sickness. They also discovered that smaller animals, such as rats, were more resistant to the effects of decompression, suggesting that body mass plays a significant role in the severity of decompression illness.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Research"}
