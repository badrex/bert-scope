Roscoe, conducted research on vanadium compounds, focusing on the composition and mode of preparation of vanadium's compounds with chlorine and the properties of the metal itself. He discovered three chlorides of vanadium and explored their properties, as well as the nitrides of vanadium. This research expanded the understanding of vanadium chemistry and its potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
