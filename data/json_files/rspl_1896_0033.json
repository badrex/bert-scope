They found that the hysteresis was significantly reduced under these conditions compared to an alternating field. The results supported the theory that hysteresis is not due to mechanical restraint of the molecules and provided insights into the three stages of molecular movement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
