This closed system can initiate cellular differentiation and return to the starting point, providing a flexible mechanism. The study also found that cytoplasmic equilibria can change with time and be influenced by the medium. The existence of a second closed system of cytoplasmic inheritance in the same isolate suggests that such systems are not limited to the A-B phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
