They found that juice from roots with effective nodules promoted better growth of the bacteria than juice from roots with ineffective nodules. This suggests that ineffective strains of nodule bacteria struggle to grow in the host plant environment, which may explain their ineffectiveness in nitrogen fixation within the host legume.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
