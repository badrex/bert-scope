They compare the positions of stars from different time periods, such as Bradley's observations in 1748 and Argelander's observations in 1830. The author concludes that the proper motions of stars, including those in the southern hemisphere, support the idea of the solar system's motion in space. This research is important for understanding the dynamics of our solar system and its place in the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
