They discovered that hammering brass can create a north or south polarity, and that the magnetism in brass is due to the presence of iron. The author also developed a new suspension method for magnetic needles using a spider's thread, which allowed for more sensitive experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
