They explore the interrelations between different inequalities and establish some statical implications. The study depends on several ancillary theorems that have intrinsic interest in the broader field of stress-strain analysis. The main result is a general inequality that implies the stronger version of the postulate, which is essential for understanding the behavior of elastic solids under finite strain.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Solid Mechanics"}
