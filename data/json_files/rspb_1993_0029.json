They found that pigeons can rank mimics according to their similarity to a wasp model, even if the mimicry appears poor to the human eye. This discovery provides a powerful tool for studying the evolution of these patterns and understanding the complexities of mimicry in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
