The rate of decomposition is not influenced by impurities in the solvent, and the reaction is faster in solution than in the gaseous state. The findings suggest that the solvent acts as an inert gas, facilitating the unimolecular reaction. The study also explores the effect of adding chlorine to the reaction, finding that it increases the rate of decomposition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
