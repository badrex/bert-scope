They discovered that the temperature at the rear of the relaxation zone was higher than expected due to viscous attenuation of the shock wave. A simple formula was derived to connect the temperature variation, shock speed variation, and pressure variation, which was used to predict temperature variations in the experiments. The results showed that the general trend was correctly predicted, but there were some discrepancies in the oxygen results that may be inherent in the line-reversal method of measuring temperature under shock-tube conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
