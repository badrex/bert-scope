They also find that argon may be a mixture of at least two elements, one glowing red and the other blue. The author discusses the similarities and differences between argon and nitrogen spectra and concludes that, based on spectrum work, argon may be a new member of the family of elementary bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
