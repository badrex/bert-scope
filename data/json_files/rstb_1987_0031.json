The research focuses on the unique adaptations of this species, such as cuticular spines for protection, specialized setae for filtering and cleaning, and the hydraulic mechanism that powers the movement of the filtering limbs. The study also includes a redescription of the species and its distribution in the Weddell Sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
