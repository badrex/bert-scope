They discovered that the oxidation process produced a yellow crystalline mass of acidic oxidation products, including mellitic acid and benzene tetracarboxylic acid. These findings provide insight into the chemical structure of coal and its components.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
