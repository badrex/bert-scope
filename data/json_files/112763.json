The study reveals that the optic nerve and other structures related to sight undergo significant changes during the growth of the mole, and the eye of the adult mole lacks a cornea, sclerotic, iris, and pupillary aperture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
