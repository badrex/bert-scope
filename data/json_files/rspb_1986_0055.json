The conductance plays a significant role in the spatial buffering of potassium ions, contributing to the understanding of astrocytes' functions in the central nervous system. The study provides insights into the properties of this chloride conductance and its similarities to other voltage-gated chloride channels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurochemistry"}
