The authors argue that the momentum of a light wave is inversely proportional to the refractive index, supporting Abraham's result, rather than being proportional to it as Minkowski's theory predicts. The study has implications for understanding the interaction of light with refractive materials and the energy-momentum distribution in the medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Wave Theory"}
