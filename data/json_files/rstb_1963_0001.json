The authors found that in some districts, certain morphs of the snails predominate regardless of habitat and background, which they call \"area effects.\" These effects are not due to visual selection or habitat differences but are likely caused by some form of selection. The authors suggest that local features of topography may produce localized climatic conditions that influence the relative distributions of the species and the abundance of certain morphs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
