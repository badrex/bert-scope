The research found that these worms can survive in a wide range of osmotic pressures, and regeneration occurs through a combination of regulatory and reductive changes. The worms' regeneration process involves the migration and transformation of parenchyma cells, which play a crucial role in forming new tissues and organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Developmental Biology"}
