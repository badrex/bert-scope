The authors analyze shallow coring, surface geomorphology, lithology, vegetation patterns, and radiometric dating to understand the sequence of reef and island development in Holocene time. They also explore the transition from vertical to horizontal reef growth and discuss latitudinal variations in reef forms along the Great Barrier Reef.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
