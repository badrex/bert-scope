They prepared 105 unsymmetrical cyanines and examined their absorption spectra, finding that the correlation of frequencies of maximum absorption with changes in chemical constitution was interesting and provided insights into the properties of these dyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
