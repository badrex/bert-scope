It explains how the rectal complex helps maintain salt balance under heavy dietary loading and contributes to the removal of water from the faeces. The rectal complex plays a significant role in the excretory system of these larvae, and the study provides insights into the mechanisms involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
