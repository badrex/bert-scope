The study shows how these temperature distributions affect the large-deflexion vibrations of the plates, providing a better understanding of their behavior under thermal stresses and strains. The research is relevant to high-speed aerodynamics and the design of lifting and control surfaces of missiles.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering > Structural Analysis and Design"}
