They discovered that some proteins contain sulphur in a form other than cystine, and discussed various experimental findings and methods for identifying these sulphur compounds. This research contributes to understanding the chemistry of proteins and their structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
