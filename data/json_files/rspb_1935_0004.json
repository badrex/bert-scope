They found that temperature influences plant growth and geotropism, with a decrease in sensitivity occurring in winter. The results indicate a relationship between temperature and the presentation time required for geotropism, which can be used to better understand plant responses to environmental factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
