They calculate the magnetic susceptibility of an electron gas for small magnetic fields and find that the equation of state is unaffected by the magnetic field to the Debye-Huckel approximation. The first-order exchange effects are also examined, and the divergence is shown to be removed when ring diagrams are included.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
