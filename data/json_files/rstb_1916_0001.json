The research reveals that marsupials have a more primitive thymus development compared to other mammals, with two pairs of thoracic thymus glands derived from the entoderm of the third and fourth gill-pouches. The findings contribute to the understanding of the organogenesis and development of these endocrine structures in marsupials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
