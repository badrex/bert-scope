The research found that increasing hydrostatic pressure led to increased creep ductility and a decrease in cavitation, resulting in a longer time to failure. The results are discussed in terms of a diffusional cavity growth model that includes continuous nucleation and compared with data from single-phase materials tested under similar conditions. The study also examines the role of principal and equivalent stresses in the creep fracture of the steel and discusses the estimation of long-term creep life from short-term creep tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Creep Mechanics"}
