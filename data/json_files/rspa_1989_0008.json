The theoretical model is formulated using the potential and streamfunction as independent variables, and the shape of the lower edge of the crack is determined from the solution of a Fredholm integral equation of the first kind. The method is tested using theoretical distributions of potential from known crack shapes, showing very good agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Engineering"}
