They found that the weight of the precipitate formed is directly proportional to the amount of antiserum, provided the quantity of homologous protein exceeds a certain minimal amount. This research helps in understanding the interaction between antibodies and antigens, which is essential for studying immune responses and developing diagnostic tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
