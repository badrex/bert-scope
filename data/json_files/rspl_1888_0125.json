W. R\u00fccker and T. E. Thorpe conducted a magnetic survey of the British Isles in 1884-1888, observing at 200 principal and secondary stations. They discovered a widespread regional magnetic disturbance, with its center between Windsor and Reading. The authors hypothesized that the attraction was due to the presence of igneous rocks, and the disturbance extended over an area of about 10,000 square miles."}
