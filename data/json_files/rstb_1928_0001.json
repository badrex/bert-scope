They find a negative correlation between leaf size and stomatal frequency, meaning smaller leaves have more stomata per unit area. The study also shows that stomatal frequency increases from the base to the apex of a plant, with radical leaves having fewer stomata than cauline leaves. This research highlights the importance of understanding how environmental factors affect plant anatomy and adaptation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
