They found that exercise slightly increased the elimination of nitrogen, while alcohol had no significant effect. The study also showed that the body's pulse rate increased with alcohol consumption and during exercise. These findings support the idea that intellectual and moral gifts, like physical qualities, are inherited traits."}
