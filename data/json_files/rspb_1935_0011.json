The results show that estradiol causes a localized oedematous swelling in the genital area and extragenital regions. The study also demonstrates that castration and hypophysectomy have no significant influence on the response to estradiol. Histological analysis reveals changes in the connective tissue and epidermis of the affected areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
