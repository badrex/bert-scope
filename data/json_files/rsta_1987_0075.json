The authors measure cosmogenic isotopes 10Be and 26Al in cosmic spherules, confirming their extraterrestrial origin and suggesting they are likely cometary debris. They also analyze 10Be in marine sediment cores, revealing information about geomagnetic intensity changes during reversals and the acquisition of magnetic remanence in sediments. Lastly, the authors study 10Be in a 2083-meter ice core from Vostok, Antarctica, which suggests that the precipitation rate during the last Ice Age was about half of its present rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
