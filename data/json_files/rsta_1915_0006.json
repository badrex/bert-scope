They find that the amplitude of the magnetic variation is inversely proportional to the cube of the lunar distance, supporting the tidal hypothesis. Additionally, the author discovers a remarkable phenomenon where the phase of the lunar magnetic variation at perigee is considerably in advance of that at apogee.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geomagnetism"}
