Genetic studies have identified 14 genes involved in this process, defining a genetic pathway for apoptosis in C. elegans. The authors describe the roles of key genes, such as ced-3, ced-4, and ced-9, and their similarities to proteins affecting apoptosis in vertebrates. They also discuss how cell-death specification genes, like ces-1, ces-2, and egl-1, influence the decision of certain cells to live or die.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
