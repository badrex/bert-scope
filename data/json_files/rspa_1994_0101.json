The study focuses on the worst encounter frequency that induces the most severe beam-sea resonance. The results show that a symmetrical vessel can lose up to 30% of its sustainable wave slope under realistic wind loading, emphasizing the importance of considering both transient wave excitation and lateral wind loading in ship design.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Architecture"}
