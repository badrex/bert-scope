They discovered that the pressure coefficient of conductivity for liquid helium varies with temperature, being negative below 1.63 K and positive above it. The results suggest that the change in thermal conductivity is due to variations in density, specific heat, and the product of velocity and mean free path.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
