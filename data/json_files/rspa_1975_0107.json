The authors establish a formal definition of flow stress by studying the stability of equilibrium of a group of screw dislocations. They use the Routh-Hurwitz theorem and the Lienard & Chipart theorem to predict the onset of instability and provide accurate bounds for the flow stress. This approach improves previous methods and provides a more mathematically sound understanding of the concept of flow stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Solid Mechanics"}
