This transition is characterized by intermittent behavior and may have implications for the response of cnidarians to climate change. The study suggests that elevated temperatures induce chaotic behavior in cnidarian gastrovascular systems, which may lead to large temporal variance of gas and nutrient concentrations and potential for irreversible damage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cnidarian Biology"}
