They developed a 'gap' test to measure the minimum gap thickness that inhibits detonation and found that the sensitivity of a mixture of explosives is related to the sensitivities and amounts of its components. The authors also proposed a hypothesis explaining the observed facts, stating that the entering shock wave initiates reactions which release energy, and the probability of detonation is controlled by the balance of energy lost and gained by the shock wave.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Shockwave Physics"}
