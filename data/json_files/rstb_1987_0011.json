The research focuses on the connections between the arms and the inferior frontal, superior frontal, and vertical lobes, as well as the precommissural lobe. The findings provide insights into the neural control of the arms and the possible learning systems in these cephalopods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
