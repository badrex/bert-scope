The authors model the helium as a two-fluid continuum and incorporate relaxation and healing terms into the governing equations. They find that the superfluid velocity behaves like a power law, and the healing parameter can be scaled out of the equations. The results reduce to those obtained by Clark (1963) when healing and relaxation are ignored.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
