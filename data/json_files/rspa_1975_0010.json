They discovered a transitory enhancement of diamagnetic susceptibility in the mesophase region when the isotropic melt is cooled with a magnetic field applied. This finding suggests that cluster formation and changes in cation-anion binding may occur near the transition temperature. The response of these salts to applied magnetic fields reveals pronounced magnetic anomalies, particularly near the transition from isotropic to mesophase fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
