It explores the crown's role in supplying oxygen to the worms, particularly in the absence of tube irrigation. The research finds that the crown can provide oxygen to the hind parts of the worms when tube irrigation is not possible, and that the worms' ability to survive and regenerate after injury to the anterior end is different in each species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
