They examine the effects of different magnetic forces on the iron's permeability and hysteresis loops, discovering that shielding the iron from the Earth's magnetism significantly alters its magnetic properties. This research contributes to a better understanding of iron's behavior under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
