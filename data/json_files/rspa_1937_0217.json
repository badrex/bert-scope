They developed a differential method that measures the heat evolved during the heating process, allowing for more accurate quantification of the latent energy. This method avoids the need for many assumptions typically made in other methods, providing more reliable results for various materials and amounts of cold work.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
