They discuss the importance of studying the evolutionary trends of different orders of amphibia to determine their connections and construct hypothetical ancestors. This research allows for a better understanding of the primitive amphibian structure and its relation to fish of similar ages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
