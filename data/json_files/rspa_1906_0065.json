They also discover that certain minerals, such as zircon, sphene, perovskite, and apatite, are rich in radium, while others like quartz and felspar contain less. The study suggests that radium, or its parent uranium, is not perfectly separated from a rock magma during the crystallization of heavy minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
