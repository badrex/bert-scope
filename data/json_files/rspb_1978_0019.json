The ventrogenital complex helps in cross-fertilization between two individuals. The complex consists of a ventral invagination, the ventrogenital sac, which contains a protrusible gonotyl and a modified ventral sucker. The author explains the mode of operation and the role of muscles in copulation, as well as the development of the ventrogenital complex in the encysted metacercaria and adult stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
