The author finds that conjugate eye deviation occurs from various areas, including the frontal region, superior temporal gyrus, and the occipital lobe. The latency periods of these movements are measured to understand the functional differences and the possible causes of these movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurology"}
