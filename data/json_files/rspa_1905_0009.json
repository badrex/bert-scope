Hahn and Sir William Ramsay describe the discovery of a new radioactive element that evolves thorium emanation. They discuss the properties and activities of this element, comparing it to actinium and thorium, and explore its potential presence in soil and mineral springs. The new substance is found to be significantly more active than thorium, with potential implications for the understanding of radioactive materials."}
