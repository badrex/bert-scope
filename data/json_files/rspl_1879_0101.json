They describe experiments with cinchonine-derived chinoline and leucoline, and the resulting acids and salts. The author also explores the differences between leucoline from coal tar and that from cinchona, as well as the isomers present in these bases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
