They apply strong-coupling asymptotic expansions to the model and obtain the adiabatic semi-classical scattering matrix, which describes non-adiabatic transitions between quasi-stationary states. The authors also discuss the Berry phase interpretation of the model and show that it reduces to known limiting cases, such as the Demkov, Rosen-Zener, and parabolic models."}
