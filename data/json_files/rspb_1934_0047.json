They discovered that egg white causes uncoordinated contractions, or \"twittering,\" in the heart cells, preventing normal coordinated pulsations. The study used entire hearts of 2-3 day embryos in egg white media to observe the effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
