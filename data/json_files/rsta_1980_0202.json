They found that the microgabbro received much of its cosmic ray exposure at depth in the regolith, suggesting that the regolith layers above the microgabbro at the Luna 24 site are younger. The study also revealed that the regolith at the Luna 24 site has been relatively undisturbed for much of the last 300 million years.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochronology"}
