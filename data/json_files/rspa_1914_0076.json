They find that the compound is stable at low temperatures and can decompose explosively at higher temperatures. It reacts with platinum and iron, and its aqueous solution can be used to estimate formaldehyde concentrations. The compound's structure and composition are analyzed, and its relationship to other similar compounds is discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
