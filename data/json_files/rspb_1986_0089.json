Nicorandil increased outward currents at potentials positive to the resting potential and shortened the action potential duration. The current-voltage relation reversed close to the potassium equilibrium potential, indicating that the current is carried by K+ ions. The properties of this K+ channel are characterized by voltage-independent kinetics and a smaller single-channel conductance compared to other K+ channels in cardiac muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
