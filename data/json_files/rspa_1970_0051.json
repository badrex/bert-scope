This new equation is derived using a method similar to Long's approach and offers advantages over previous methods, such as Nekrasov's equation. The equation can be used to find the height of the waves explicitly and has the potential to improve our understanding of fluid dynamics and wave theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
