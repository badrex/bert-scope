This method is faster and more effective than using glycerine, which can take weeks to eliminate bacteria. Chloroform-treated vaccines can be used immediately, saving vaccine material and improving vaccination outcomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Immunology and Vaccines"}
