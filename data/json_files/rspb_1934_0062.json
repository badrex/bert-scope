The researchers examined uniform background brightness, uniform surround brightness, and isolated bright patches, finding that these factors significantly affect the liminal brightness increment. The findings provide insights into how the human eye perceives brightness and color under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
