The authors develop a solution in the form of Sommerfeld integrals, which represent a superposition of plane longitudinal and transverse waves. They establish functional equations for the unknown amplitudes of these waves using boundary conditions and solve the singular parts of the equations using Fourier transforms. The regular parts are expanded in Chebyshev polynomials, and an asymptotic expression for the edge-diffracted field is given.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
