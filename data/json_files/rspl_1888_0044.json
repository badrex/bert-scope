The author investigates the relationship between magnetizing force, induction, and temperature. The results show that impure nickel requires higher magnetizing forces to achieve the same induction as pure nickel. The magnetization of the impure nickel sample disappears around 310\u00b0C, and the specific heat properties are analyzed to understand the heat absorption or liberation related to magnetizability.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Magnetism"}
