They introduce the concept of conjugate equations and discuss the significance of the sign of the discriminant in determining the number of imaginary roots. The author also introduces the idea of per-rotatory and trans-rotatory types and their variation-index, which play a crucial role in the proof.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
