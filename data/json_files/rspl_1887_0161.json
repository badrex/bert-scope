It describes the arrangement of the brain's membrane, ventricles, and cranial nerves, as well as the structure of the cerebrum, optic lobes, cerebellum, and spinal cord. The study highlights the similarities and differences between the Ceratodus Forsteri, Protopterus, Plagiostomata, and Teleostei in terms of their nervous system development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate anatomy"}
