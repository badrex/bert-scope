They suggest that during magnetic disturbances, additional or enhanced magnetic fields due to electric currents near the earth's surface contribute to the formation of auroras. Neutral lines in the magnetic field near the earth are responsible for the location, nature, and motion of auroral forms. The authors predict that reversals of the magnetic field will be found during great auroral displays on the dark side of the earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetosphere"}
