The authors use an upper bound technique and a self-consistent method to calculate the overall creep properties. They find that the self-consistent method provides accurate results, especially for high stress levels. The study also provides a basis for assessing commonly used stress-creep potentials and concludes that a simple potential based on the single effective stress invariant can reasonably characterize multiaxial stress dependence.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
