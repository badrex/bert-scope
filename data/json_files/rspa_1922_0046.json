They find that the nitrogen bands are usually present in Shetland photographs but not in the night sky in the South of England. The study helps determine whether the ordinary night sky effect should be classified as a northern light or not.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
