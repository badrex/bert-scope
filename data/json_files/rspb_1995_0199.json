The authors analyze various hypotheses for the disappearance of the population, including density dependence, deterministic decline, and frequent rapid fluctuations in population numbers. They use a demographic simulation model to test the impact of different factors on the population's extinction risk. The findings highlight the challenges in determining the cause(s) of extinction in small and declining populations, emphasizing the importance of conservation efforts to protect endangered species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation Biology"}
