Both models show interannual fluctuations that resemble the Southern Oscillation, but they differ in the way El Ni\u00f1o episodes evolve and the mechanisms that cause a turnabout from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a and vice versa. The models capture certain aspects of the interactions between the ocean and atmosphere that cause the Southern Oscillation, but reality is more complex, and additional processes not yet included may also have a significant influence on the observed Southern Oscillation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
