They explain that previous experiments may have yielded inaccurate results due to the presence of impurities, such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, and other contaminants. These impurities can affect the nature and mobility of ions, leading to incorrect conclusions. The authors emphasize the importance of using highly pure gases and advanced apparatus designs to obtain accurate results in future experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
