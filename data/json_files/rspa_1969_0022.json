They found that the Huggins constant is related to its value at the theta-point, which is a critical point in polymer solutions. This new approach provides a better understanding of the concentration dependence of the relaxation spectrum and the viscosity equation in polymer solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
