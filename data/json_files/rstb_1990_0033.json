It discusses the role of low temperatures in controlling plant distribution, reproduction, and seed germination. The study presents examples of plant species, such as Verbena officinalis and Umbilicus rupestris, and their responses to low-temperature environments through transplantation and long-term observations. The findings highlight the importance of understanding plant adaptation to low temperatures for predicting and managing the effects of climate change on plant distribution and survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
