The telescope's front lens is composed of two plano-convex lenses, and the fluid lens corrects for color and spherical aberration. The author also discusses the dispersive ratio between the fluid and crown glass, as well as the radii of curvature of the lenses.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics and Optical Instruments"}
