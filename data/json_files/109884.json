The author found that the temperature of the sea was subject to variations similar to those of the atmosphere, and that shallow sea areas had comparatively lower temperatures. These findings can be useful for mariners to identify the vicinity of shallow areas. The author also mentioned the dense mist over Table Mountain, which he believed was connected to ocean currents and cold winds.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
