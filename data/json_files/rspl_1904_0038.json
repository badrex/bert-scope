They found that the parabolic connection between temperature and resistance is not valid at very low temperatures and that gold and silver are the best metals for measuring temperature in this range. The results also showed that the resistance of metals decreases with temperature and approaches a specific value at extremely low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
