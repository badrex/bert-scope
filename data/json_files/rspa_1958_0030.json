They found deviations from Beer's law in some cases and interpreted these results in terms of the theory of incomplete dissociation. The study determined the formulae of associated ions and thermodynamic dissociation constants for the ions at different temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
