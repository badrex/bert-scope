The author discusses the effects of hard and soft iron on compass deviations and the role of correcting magnets in adjusting these deviations. The study aims to provide a means of predicting changes in compass deviations for different ships and navigating the world based on their magnetic characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Naval Engineering"}
