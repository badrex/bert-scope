{"article_id": "rspb_1969_0078", "revised_title": "Exploring the Complexity of Isozymes and their Genetic Determination", "semantic_tags": ["Genetics", "Enzymes", "Isozymes", "Molecular Biology", "Protein Structure"], "tldr": "The article discusses the phenomenon of isozymes, which are multiple molecular forms of an enzyme. It explores the various ways isozymes can be generated, such as through multiple gene loci, multiple alleles at a single locus, and other causes like secondary chemical modifications or differences in tertiary structure. The author also highlights the use of electrophoresis in studying isozymes and its applications in genetic analysis and understanding enzyme patterns in different tissues and species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
