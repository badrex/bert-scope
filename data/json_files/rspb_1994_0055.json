The researchers found that birds with elongated tails and increased asymmetry had a harder time maneuvering through a maze, demonstrating that there is a cost to having a longer and more asymmetrical tail. This suggests that birds with high quality may produce more symmetrical ornaments to minimize these costs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
