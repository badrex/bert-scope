The study reveals the area's glacial history, including two major ice advances during the Anglian glacial stage, which caused the river to be diverted and eventually led to the formation of the modern river valleys. The research provides a better understanding of the area's geological past and the development of the River Thames.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
