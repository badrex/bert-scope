This allowed them to study the backward influence of area V5 on area VI and the importance of re-entrant signals from V5 to VI for conscious visual motion perception. The findings provide insights into the functioning of the visual cortex and the perception of motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Perception"}
