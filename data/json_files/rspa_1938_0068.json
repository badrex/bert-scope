They found that the main coal substance has an essential benzenoid character and that the attack on an aromatic molecule begins on the carbon atom nearest the nucleus. The authors also discovered that substitution of nuclear hydrogen by hydroxyl makes a benzenoid ring more susceptible to disruption during alkaline permanganate attack.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
