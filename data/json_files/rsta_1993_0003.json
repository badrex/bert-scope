They investigated how the permeability of the mantle affects the rate of melt migration and found that the presence of orthopyroxene can influence the interconnected melt network. The results provide insights into the chemical composition and physical properties of the Earth's mantle and help to understand processes such as pressure-release melting beneath mid-ocean ridges.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
