The study aimed to determine the Earth's magnetic field's inclination, or \"dip,\" at different locations. The author took precautions to ensure accurate measurements and compared the results with local instruments and previous observations. The findings provide valuable data for understanding Earth's magnetic field and its variations across different locations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
