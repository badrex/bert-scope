They used kataphoresis to investigate the isoelectric point and the potential in vitro glucose-insulin reaction. The results indicated a physicochemical interaction between glucose and insulin in alkaline solutions, but no clear physiological parallel was demonstrated.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
