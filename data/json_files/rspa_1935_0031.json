They found that the main coal substance can be oxidized to a mixture of carbonic anhydride, acetic, oxalic, and benzenecarboxylic acids. The results provide insights into the maturing process of coals and contribute to understanding technical problems such as coal conversion to oil by pressure hydrogenation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
