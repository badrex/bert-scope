Edwards provides a detailed description of the bird's physical characteristics, including its size, coloration, bill shape, and eye placement. He also discusses the bird's habitat and behavior, as well as its probable origins and potential for further discovery.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
