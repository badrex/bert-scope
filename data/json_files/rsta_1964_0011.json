The team conducted a geological survey of the Tristan group and investigated the connection between the volcanic activity and the environment. The study found that the islands are part of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and that the volcanic activity is associated with the large arc of the ridge. The research also examined the impact of the volcanic eruption on the introduced and indigenous fauna and flora of the island.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
