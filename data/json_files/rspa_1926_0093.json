Instead of pure ice, a solid solution of gelatin and ice separates, and the spongy structure found in gels after freezing and thawing is due to the dissolution of this solid solution. The research also explores different types of freezing and the factors that influence the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Chemistry"}
