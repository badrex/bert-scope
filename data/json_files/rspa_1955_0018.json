They study various transition metals and non-transition metals, observing the formation of oxide layers and the role of surface roughness. The authors propose an interchange mechanism for the first oxide layer formation and discuss the implications for catalytic oxidation and the Cabrera-Mott theory of oxide layer formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
