They found a well-defined annual variation with a small amplitude, and a 6-monthly term in the intensity variations. The long-period variation in the light intensity was found to be smaller at the Cape than in England, and its relationship to the sun-spot period is uncertain.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
