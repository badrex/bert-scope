The researchers found significant differences in the faecal flora of rats and bats on the islands, with mammals on Java showing higher levels of antibiotic resistance. The study suggests that the widespread use of antibiotics by humans on Java may be contributing to the increased resistance in the local wildlife.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
