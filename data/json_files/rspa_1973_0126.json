The authors find that the stress predicted by Flory's model is sensitive to the elasticity theory used, and that a more reliable dynamical calculation predicts a slower decay than Flory's model. The model's accuracy in handling time-dependence is discussed, and the results are compared with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
