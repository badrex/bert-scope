The author, John Marshall, investigates the metamorphosis of these veins and their relations in different animals, both in their normal arrangement and in abnormal cases in the human body. The study reveals the coronary sinus as the lower persistent portion of the left anterior primitive venous trunk and discusses the various remnants of this primitive vein found in adults. The author also compares the great anterior veins in humans to those in mammals, highlighting the differences and similarities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Anatomy and Physiology"}
