Through a series of chemical reactions, the author identifies creosote as a methylated oxytolyllic acid, closely related to oxyphenic acid. This research contributes to the understanding of the chemical structure and properties of creosote.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
