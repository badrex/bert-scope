They conduct experiments to understand the dispersion of particles in the air and the factors affecting their suspension, such as agitation, gas viscosity, and temperature. The author concludes that the flow of sewage in a properly constructed sewer is not likely to be attended by the suspension of zymotic matters in the air.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Health"}
