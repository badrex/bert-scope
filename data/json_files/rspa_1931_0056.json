They identify three types of physical entities: positive electricity, negative electricity, and radiation. The study shows that a physical entity can be associated with the propagation of a vector A in a specific direction, leading to the existence of matter and radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
