The method is based on the parallel transport of states and can be applied to systems with non-degenerate instantaneous eigenstates. The iterative scheme provides a sequence of phase approximations, which can be used to study the behavior of quantum systems driven by slowly changing Hamiltonians.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum mechanics"}
