They discuss the application of Newton's method and the construction of approximate solutions in one-dimensional problems, using smooth Hermit and cubic spline spaces. This approach can be applied to various types of bearings, providing a solution to the challenges of elastohydrodynamic lubrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
