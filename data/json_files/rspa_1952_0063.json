They found that the main catalytic process is unlikely to involve simultaneous attack by an acid and a base, suggesting that a ternary mechanism might not be common in acid-base catalysis. This research helps to understand the reaction kinetics and mechanisms of hydration reactions in organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
