The author, J. Pond, presents a table of these variations and notes that the data is more likely to increase skepticism about determining small quantities through astronomical observations. He also expresses hope that the issue will be resolved in a few years.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
