It discusses spherical and anisometric micelles, their interactions, and the effects of fields and flow on rod-like micelles. The article also explores the aggregation of amphiphiles into bilayers and the possible stability of other isotropic bilayer phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Chemistry"}
