The authors present a model that explains how adapting and masking gratings alter the psychophysical threshold for detecting a test grating, incorporating two distinct tuning functions: a broad adaptive contrast function and a narrow effective contrast function. This model accounts for various experimental findings, including the location and size of the facilitative dip in masking functions and the constant slopes of adaptation functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
