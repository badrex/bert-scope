They explore the a-helix model and its compatibility with various protein structures, including a-keratin, haemoglobin, and synthetic polypeptides. The author also addresses criticisms and alternative models, ultimately supporting the a-helix as a significant and versatile structure in biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure"}
