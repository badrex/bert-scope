He used a glass receiver, two brass hemispheres, and an air pump to show that an atmosphere of air on the hemispheres' outward surfaces made it difficult to separate them. This experiment confirmed the pressure of air and disproved alternative hypotheses, such as suction or funicular power.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Experimental Physics"}
