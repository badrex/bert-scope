The authors found that aesculin's fluorescent power can be destroyed by exposure to ultraviolet light or ozonized oxygen, and the transformed solutions have a different absorption spectrum. The study also shows that the transformation process is not affected by the presence of transformed molecules in the solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy and Photochemistry"}
