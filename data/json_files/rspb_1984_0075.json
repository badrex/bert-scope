Using scanning and transmission electron microscopy, as well as energy-dispersive X-ray analysis, the researchers found various morphologies of silica particles within the macrohairs and analyzed the time-dependent concentrations of elements like potassium, chlorine, phosphorus, and sulfur. The study provides insights into the processes of silicification in plants and the potential role of macrohairs in plant defense and phytoremediation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
