The authors discuss previous magnetic surveys and explain the methods used in their own survey. They provide an account of the magnetic observations taken between 1834-38 and 1857-62, and the results were reduced to the epoch 1842-5 by Sir E. Sabine. The authors also mention their own survey conducted between 1884-88, which aimed to determine declination and the force of the Earth's magnetic field at various locations in the British Isles.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
