The cyanobacterium thrives in the lake's stratified metalimnion and has unique adaptations, such as light-intensity-regulated buoyancy control, which allows it to survive in the lake's challenging conditions. The study provides insights into the biology and ecology of this new organism and its role in stratified aquatic environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
