It argues that complex systems can be structured as interconnected assemblies of subsystems, and by exploiting this structure, it is possible to decompose the problem of controlling a complex system into manageable subproblems. The article explores decentralized optimization and hierarchical control methods, emphasizing their importance in managing complex industrial systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Optimization"}
