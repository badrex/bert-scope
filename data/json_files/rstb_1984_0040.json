It describes the triple helical structure of collagen molecules and their arrangement in fibrils. The article also discusses the process of mineralization by calcium hydroxyapatite in the gaps between collagen molecules, which contributes to bone strength and rigidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Molecular Biology"}
