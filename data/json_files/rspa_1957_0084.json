They demonstrate the accuracy of these formulae by comparing them with available experimental data and theoretical predictions. The authors also provide additional comparison data by accurately calculating the parallel dipole polarizability of the ground state of hydrogen molecular ion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
