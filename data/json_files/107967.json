They define respiration as the quantity of oxygen consumed or exchanged for carbonic acid and irritability as the property of the muscular fiber that causes contraction upon stimulus. The author observes that animals with higher respiration have lower irritability, and vice versa. This relationship is seen in various animal forms, ages, and conditions, including hibernation. The author also describes a new apparatus called the Pneumatometer, which measures the quantity of respiration in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
