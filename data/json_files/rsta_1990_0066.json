Experiments were conducted in a rotating tow tank, and various flow visualization techniques were used to study the flow patterns. The results show that rapid background rotation causes separation and vortex shedding at higher Reynolds numbers and forms an asymmetrical wake flow with cyclonic eddies dominating their anticyclonic counterparts. The presence of rotation also leads to strong steering of the upper-level flow by the bottom topography, known as the Taylor column effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
