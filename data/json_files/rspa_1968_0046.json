The compound has a mean formal oxidation state of III for the rhenium atoms, and the metal-metal bond has an order of 3. The study provides insights into the molecular and electronic structures of related compounds containing rhenium atoms in different oxidation states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
