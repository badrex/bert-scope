They used an eudiometer to accurately measure the amount of carbon dioxide produced and the oxygen consumed. The results showed that the human body gives off carbon dioxide at a rate of about 26.55 cubic inches per minute and consumes oxygen at a similar rate. The authors also found that the faster the respiration, the more carbon dioxide is given off and the more oxygen is consumed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Respiration and Gas Exchange"}
