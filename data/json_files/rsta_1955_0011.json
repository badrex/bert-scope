The experiments reveal that the proportion of trapped flux increases with indium concentration. A model based on the theories of London & London and Gorter & Casimir, incorporating the concept of coherence, is developed to explain the observed behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
