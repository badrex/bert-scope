They found that the presence of floating matter in the air is necessary for the growth of bacteria and putrefaction, while the absence of floating matter prevents it. This discovery supports the idea that the power of developing life in the air and its power of scattering light are closely related.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
