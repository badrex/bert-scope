The research found that death temperature variations are more common in surgical cases and that females are more likely to experience death temperature changes. The authors also discovered that falls in temperature are more common in patients suffering from disease, while rises in temperature are present in equal proportions in patients dying from disease or injury.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Research"}
