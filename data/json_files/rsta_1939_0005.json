They used a reversible pendulum with a non-magnetic light alloy I-section rod and a precision chronograph for time measurement. This method improved the accuracy of gravity measurements and had implications for determining the absolute unit of electric current using a current balance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
