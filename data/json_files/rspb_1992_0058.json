It shows that most muscle fibres from older mdx mice have significant structural deformities and identifies a population of post-degenerative fibres with both central and peripheral nuclei. The research also demonstrates that a mild lengthening protocol causes damage to the deformed fast glycolytic fibres in mdx mice, which are also the fibres preferentially affected in human muscular dystrophy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscular Dystrophy"}
