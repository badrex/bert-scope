They found that the minimum pressure varied depending on the type of plant cell and its condition. The study also showed that the growth of the plant and the streaming of protoplasm in active cells are parallel phenomena, and that inability to continue movements is associated with total cessation of growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
