The researchers found that internal cracks are caused by high pressure generated from water interacting with impurities, particularly water-soluble inorganic inclusions. Surface cracking is similar to the crazing of ceramic glazes. The osmotic pressure from water-soluble inclusions and the interactions between water and cured polyester resins can create complex stress systems that lead to crack formation."}
