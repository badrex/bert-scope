It explores how selective pressures for different modes of flight have led to various wing adaptations in bats, such as agility, speed, and maneuverability. The study also examines the connection between flight morphology and echolocation, demonstrating that these adaptations are closely linked due to the joint constraints of flying and locating food in different ways.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
