He examines whether the observed effects are due to polarity or induced currents. Faraday concludes that the phenomena are closely related to the effects of induced currents and that the idea of diamagnetic polarity has not yet gained additional proof beyond the fact that diamagnetic bodies are repelled by magnetic poles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
