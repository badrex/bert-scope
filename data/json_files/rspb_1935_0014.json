They performed the surgery on 25 cats and observed changes in body weight, temperature, hair loss, and sensitivity to insulin. The results showed that hypophysectomized cats experienced a decrease in body weight, slightly lower body temperature, loss of hair, and hypersensitivity to insulin. This study contributes to the understanding of the role of the pituitary gland in the overall health of cats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
