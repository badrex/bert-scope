The treatise consists of an introduction and two books, covering fluxions in a geometrical method and their applications to important geometrical and philosophical inquiries. The author also defends the use of infinitesimals and discusses the method of the ancients, emphasizing the importance of clear and unexceptionable evidence in geometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus"}
