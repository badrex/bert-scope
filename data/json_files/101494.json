The new design involves applying an index to a common baroscope, allowing for better visibility of the altitude variation of the mercurial cylinder. This improved design can be used for various baroscope sizes and helps make the measurements more distinguishable.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
