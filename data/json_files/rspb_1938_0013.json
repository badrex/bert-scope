They found that certain modifications to the molecule, such as the presence of a piperidine ring system, were essential for antiplasmodial activity. The study aimed to understand the factors necessary for antiplasmodial action and develop new potential treatments for bird malaria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
