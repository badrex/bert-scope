The author, John Henry Pratt, uses mathematical formulas and spherical trigonometry to calculate the average height and mass of the regions and determine the point of concentration of the attracting mass. The findings help to understand the discrepancies in the survey results and provide insights into the behavior of the Earth's gravitational field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
