It explores the use of broadband optical excitation, pulsed tunable dye lasers, and time-resolved observations to study the interference phenomenon known as quantum beats and determine Land\u00e9 factors, fine, and hyperfine splittings of excited levels. The review also covers recent advancements in probe-beam monitoring and pulse trains from mode-locked dye lasers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
