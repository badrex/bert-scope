A time estimation task, considered a sensitive index of cerebellar function, was administered to dyslexic and control children. Dyslexic children demonstrated a predicted deficit in time estimation but not in a control loudness estimation task. Cerebellar dysfunction provides a parsimonious explanation for various deficits in dyslexia.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
