The authors apply these integrals to obtain closed-form solutions for a finite crack in an unbounded thermoelastic medium with arbitrary thermal conditions on the crack faces. The results can be used to calculate energy release rates and stress intensity factors in fracture mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
