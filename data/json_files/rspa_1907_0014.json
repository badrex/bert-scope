They found that negative ions in flames are electrons and not atoms, and discussed the conductivity of the flame and the potential gradient necessary to drive ions across the flame. This research contributes to understanding the properties of flames and their electrical conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
