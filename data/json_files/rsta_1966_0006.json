The survey provides bathymetric and magnetic measurements at a 10-mile line spacing, revealing a northeast-southwest alignment of bathymetric features and the presence of fault scarps. The findings support the idea that the Murray Ridge is continuous with the Owen fracture zone and suggest that both are loci of strike-slip movement. The article also examines the region's seismicity and geological history, with a focus on the tectonic connections between the area and the Owen fracture zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
