A. Wanklyn, investigated the synthesis of acetic acid by reacting sodium-methyl with carbonic acid. The reaction produced a salt that, upon further treatment, yielded acetic acid. This experiment supported the idea that similar reactions occur throughout the vinic series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
