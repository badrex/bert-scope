It highlights the experiments conducted by Francis Galton and the Wurzburg school, which challenged the conventional view that thinking is carried out with the help of visual images. The author proposes a new approach to studying thinking processes, drawing parallels with the experimental study of human skilled behavior, and emphasizes the importance of understanding the temporal and spatial properties of stimuli in thinking.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
