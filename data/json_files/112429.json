Norman Lockyer, conducted spectroscopic observations of the Sun, focusing on solar spots and the chromosphere. He discovered that the C and F lines in the solar spectrum can be observed in prominences, spots, and the chromosphere. Lockyer also found that the movements of the chromosphere's absorbing material can be determined with accuracy, and that the bright lines in the solar spectrum can be interrupted by the spot-spectrum. Additionally, he observed the magnesium, sodium, and iron lines in the chromosphere for the first time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
