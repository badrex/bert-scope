They compare and evaluate different methods, ultimately adopting Hesse's method, which uses a solid nutritive medium to count and examine the colonies of airborne microbes. This method allows for more accurate and efficient analysis of the distribution of microorganisms in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Microbiology"}
