The alga was found to be continuously present in the lake's plankton throughout the year, with exponential growth occurring during a 5 to 8-week period after the onset of thermal stratification. The algae's buoyancy allowed it to maintain its position in the water column, but as photic conditions deteriorated, the algae rose and dispersed within the epilimnion. Surface blooms often led to the physical removal of colonies to lee shores.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Limnology"}
