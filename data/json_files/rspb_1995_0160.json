The results show a within-clutch trade-off between producing and rearing extra young. Parents incurring the full costs of producing extra young had reduced chick provisioning, growth, and survival. This casts doubts on previous brood enlargement experiments that provided evidence for observed clutch sizes being less than the Lack clutch size.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
