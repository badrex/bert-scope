They find that Type II quantal variance can cause the variance of successive peaks in amplitude histograms to decrease, rather than increase, leading to \"apparent negative quantal variance.\" This study provides a better understanding of the underlying factors affecting synaptic transmission in the central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
