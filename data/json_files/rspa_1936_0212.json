The study includes the wave resistance and vertical force on the cylinder, with numerical calculations for various velocities and different ratios of the cylinder's radius to its depth. The findings can be applied to similar three-dimensional problems, such as submerged spheres or spheroids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
