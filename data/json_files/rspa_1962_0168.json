They found that additives like argon, nitrogen, and iodomethane narrow the limits of detonation, while water vapor and furan have complex effects. The results help to understand the thermodynamic and kinetic characteristics of reactions that sustain detonation waves and the role of additives in inhibiting detonation propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Engineering"}
