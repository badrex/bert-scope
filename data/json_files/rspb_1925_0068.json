They found that potassium ions have a more significant impact on urine volume, while calcium ions do not have a substantial effect. The study also showed that the pituitary gland plays a crucial role in regulating chloride output in the urine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
