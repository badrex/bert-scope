Their observations were analyzed by Nevil Maskelyne, who confirmed the time and location of the phenomenon. The star-like appearance was not related to the nearby bright star Aldebaran, which had an eclipse at the same time. The cause of this celestial phenomenon remains unknown.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Lunar observation"}
