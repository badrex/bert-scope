The author explains how the general character of groundwater flow is dominated by surface topography and the decreasing hydraulic conductivity with depth. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the crucial factors to devise indirect techniques for reliable estimates of groundwater flow and its consequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
