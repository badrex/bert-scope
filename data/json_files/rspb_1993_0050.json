The research finds that riverine smelt have a significant increase in red muscle percentage during post-migratory stages, while lacustrine smelt have slower growth rates and smaller maximum sizes. The results demonstrate the usefulness of muscle plasticity in fish under natural conditions in relation to the environment and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
