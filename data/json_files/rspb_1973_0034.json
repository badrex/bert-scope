They found that the depletion of thymus-derived lymphocytes did not reduce, and may have even increased, the resistance of mice to syngeneic tumors. The injection of killed C. parvum caused further inhibition of tumor growth in T-cell deprived mice, supporting the hypothesis that the antitumor effect of C. parvum depends primarily on macrophage stimulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
