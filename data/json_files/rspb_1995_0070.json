By examining long-term, replicated population data, the authors show that a demonstrable refuge for hosts from parasitoid attack leads to the persistence of an otherwise unstable interaction. The resultant parasitoid-host dynamics follow host generation length cycles, providing empirical support for the role of refuges in population stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
