They found that hydrogen nuclei in the surface layer were farther from the fixed layer than lithium nuclei, and the hydride ions showed considerable polarization. The surface energy for this face of lithium hydride was estimated, and the results were compared with semi-empirical values for alkali halide crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
