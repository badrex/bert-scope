The mean drift horizontal force is evaluated using the Stokes expansion to second order in wave steepness. The study shows that the drift forces on a column, although of second order, can excite responses of first order due to the low natural frequency in the tilt mode. The theoretical results are compared with experimental data from a model tested in regular waves, showing reasonable agreement for the drift forces over a range of frequencies and wave heights.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Offshore Engineering"}
