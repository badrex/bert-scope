It compares this method to two-beam interference and phase-contrast microscopy, explaining how multiple-beam interference can accurately measure phase differences within objects. The article also explores the theoretical aspects of imaging phase gratings using multiple-beam interference microscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
