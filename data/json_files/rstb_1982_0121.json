They use acceleration as a measure of change in motion and demonstrate its advantages over conventional measures like speed and direction. The method is applied to a case study of collisions between normal and malignant cells, providing insights into contact inhibition of locomotion and its failure during malignant invasion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
