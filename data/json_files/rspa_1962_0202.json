They introduced a small amount of radioactive sand into the flow and tracked its movement downstream. By analyzing the time it takes for the tracer to pass a fixed section, they could determine the rate of sand transport. This method can be applied to study the movement of sand in rivers, estuaries, and other environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
