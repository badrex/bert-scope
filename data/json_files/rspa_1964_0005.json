They discovered that the forces act with frequencies related to the Strouhal frequency and that the system exhibits properties like synchronization, hysteresis, and frequency demultiplication. These findings provide a deeper understanding of the complex interactions between a cylinder and the fluid around it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
