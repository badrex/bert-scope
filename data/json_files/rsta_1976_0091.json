The studies were based on detailed subsurface investigations and correlated the development of slopes with Quaternary history. The research involved various disciplines, including geology, soil mechanics, and geomorphology, to understand the complex processes involved in slope development.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
