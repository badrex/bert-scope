They identified fifteen species, with most of them being widely distributed in tropical regions. The earthworm fauna showed no clear relationship to geographical barriers or altitudinal zonation of soils and vegetation. The author concluded that factors other than the equilibrium theory of MacArthur and Wilson are responsible for the current constitution of the earthworm fauna in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
