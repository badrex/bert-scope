The authors review experimental evidence for electron addition to fullerenes and explain their extraordinary electron affinity through a combination of topology and rehybridization. They also explore the theoretical aspects of fullerene electronic structure and its implications for their redox chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fullerenes"}
