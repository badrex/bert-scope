The research shows that stomatal density decreased in response to long-term increases in atmospheric CO2 levels, indicating that plants adapted to past environmental changes. This understanding can help predict how plants may respond to future global environmental changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
