They discovered that the movements of the radiometers were influenced by the distance, position, and shape of the screens and vanes. The author explained these phenomena by considering the generation of molecular pressure and the behavior of lines of force of repulsion. This research contributed to the understanding of the interactions between radiation, heat, and pressure in radiometers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
