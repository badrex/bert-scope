The authors analyze the minor and trace element features of magmas generated above subduction zones and evaluate their consistency with major element models. They conclude that the degree of melting varies with crustal thickness and that the observed range in Ce/Sm ratios can be generated by 3-18% fractional melting of a slightly LREE-depleted source.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
