The authors derive an integral equation that governs the growth of the fatigue crack and provide successive analytic approximations to the solution. The resulting crack growth law predicts a crack length at which catastrophic failure occurs, offering a more accurate and generalized approach to understanding fatigue crack propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
