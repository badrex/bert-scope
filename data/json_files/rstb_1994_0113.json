The authors describe a novel pathway for the clearance of extravasated granulocytes through apoptosis, which leads to their phagocytosis by inflammatory macrophages. This process helps limit tissue injury and promote inflammation resolution. The article also highlights the mechanisms and control of apoptosis in granulocytes and its potential implications for understanding the pathophysiology of inflammation and developing new therapeutic approaches.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
