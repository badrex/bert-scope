They found that substances that dissociate completely have temperatures of volatilisation independent of pressure. The study included chloral hydrate, chloral methyl, ethyl alcoholates, ammonium carbonate, ammonium chloride, aldehyde ammonia, phthalic acid, succinic acid, nitric peroxide, and acetic acid. The results showed that the smaller the amount of dissociation, the closer the curves representing pressures of dissociation and temperatures of volatilisation are to each other.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics and Chemical Reactions"}
