He proposes a model of an extended electron in an electromagnetic field and explores the possibility of applying this model to particles interacting with the gravitational field. Dirac also touches upon the potential for quantum mechanics in this theory and the challenges of incorporating spin.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
