The authors apply this method to benzene, carbon tetrachloride, chloroform, bromoform, tetrabromoethane, and carbon disulphide, providing valuable data for evaluating theories about solvent effects on absorption bands and estimating the intensities of vibrational bands of the liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
