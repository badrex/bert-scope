The study reveals that the carapace in branchiopods primarily originates from the maxillary segment, challenging previous theories suggesting thoracic origins. The author also discusses the carapace's role in various orders, such as Anostraca, Lipostraca, Notostraca, and others, and how it has evolved over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Crustacean Biology"}
