The author proposes a unitary mechanism for sulfur oxidation and assesses the efficiency of energy conservation in different species. The article also identifies unresolved problems and future research directions in the field of sulfur metabolism in thiobacilli.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Biogeochemistry"}
