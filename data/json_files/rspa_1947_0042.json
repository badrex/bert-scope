The theory considers the scatter in the values of the reduction in area at which fracture occurs in a tensile test, which determines the fragment size. The distribution of fragment lengths is calculated, providing insights into the average size of fragments from a shell made of ductile materials like steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
