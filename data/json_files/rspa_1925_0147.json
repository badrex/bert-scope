They deduce the forces between these ions using inverse power laws and apply the results to evaluate interatomic distances, compressibilities, and crystal energies of various crystals. This research provides a better understanding of the forces between atoms and ions, which is essential for explaining diverse phenomena in gases and solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
