The author highlights the recurrent nature of these fossil assemblages in the context of Pennsylvanian facies cyclicity and presents a predictive model for their occurrence. The Mazon Creek biota, consisting of marine to freshwater animals and a rich assortment of terrestrial flora, is significant for its three-dimensional preservation and early diagenetic concretion formation around fossils.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Paleobiology"}
