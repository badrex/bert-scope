They discovered that the gas can be converted into a gaseous form of carbon monosulphide, which can then polymerize and explode at slightly higher temperatures. This suggests the existence of a new volatile sulphide of carbon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Decomposition and Polymerization"}
