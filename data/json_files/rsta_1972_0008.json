It explores how the shifting pattern of volcanism is related to regional tectonic features and how these changing volcano-tectonic systems are connected to the plate-tectonic development of the northeastern part of the Pacific Ocean and western North America.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
