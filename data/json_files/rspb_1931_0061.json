It shows that muscles frozen for 24 hours can still have a considerable oxygen uptake, even if they have lost their contractile and synthetic faculties. The research also demonstrates that lactic acid is lost when these irreversibly frozen muscles are thawed and kept in oxygen, suggesting that the actual synthetic machinery of the muscle is destroyed by freezing, rather than the part that supplies energy for the working of the machine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
