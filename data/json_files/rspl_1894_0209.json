They found that the disease was more developed in soil with an acid reaction and was checked by the presence of alkalies like lime. The author also highlighted the importance of preventing the growth of weeds that are susceptible to the same disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
