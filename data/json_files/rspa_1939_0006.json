This method is more efficient and accurate than previous methods, allowing for easier calculations of bond lengths and orders in complex molecules. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of their method by applying it to benzene and cyclobutadiene, showing that it predicts bond lengths and orders in agreement with previous research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
