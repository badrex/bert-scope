Workers have access to young of various ages, which can be quickly brought to the age of independence, providing a more moderate advantage over solitary foundresses. This model offers a selective pressure for the evolution of worker behavior that is at least as strong as haplodiploidy, without the requirements of high worker-brood genetic relatedness and the ability to manipulate brood sex ratios.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
