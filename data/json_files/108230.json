They describe the polygonal shape of muscle fibers and the presence of alternating light and dark lines, which they believe play a crucial role in muscle contraction. The author also discusses the differences in muscle fiber size and shape across various animal classes and emphasizes the importance of understanding these structures for further advancements in physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
