The anthracosaur's cranial anatomy is compared to other forms, suggesting a possible relationship to the American Mississippian anthracosaur Proterogyrinus. The author also rediscovers the holotype skull of Pholidogaster pisciformis and concludes that it is an early temnospondyl labyrinthodont, not closely related to anthracosaurs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
