The main feature of biological importance is stress softening, which allows the locust to extend the membranes elastically without needing a large restoring force. The filler responsible for this phenomenon is likely the chitin fraction of the cuticle. This research contributes to understanding the toughness of biological materials and the role of chitin in stress softening.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
