The authors derive the melting curve of iron using Gibbs free energy calculations and discuss the effects of various parameters on the melting curve. The results support previous experimental data and provide insights into the thermodynamics of iron under high-pressure conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
