They derive expressions for the heat capacities of saturated vapors and examine the conditions that govern the occurrence, size, and sign of any anomalies in these properties. The study also investigates the influence of gas imperfections and the relationship between vapor pressure and temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
