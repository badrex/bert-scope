The authors found that initial dissociation of vinyl halides occurs at submonolayer coverage, followed by an associative regime at higher coverages. A mechanism involving oxidative addition of carbon-hydrogen bonds and dehydrohalogenation is proposed. The reactivity of ethylenic carbon-hydrogen bonds depends on adjacent halogen substitution, and an intermolecular mechanism is demonstrated for hydrogen halide elimination from mixed adlayer surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
