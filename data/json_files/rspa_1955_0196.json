They found that the solid-state spectra of these compounds show different configurations, including non-planar arrangements of halogen atoms. By comparing the spectra with related molecules, they assigned configurations to the solid-state and some liquid-state isomers, providing insights into the molecular structures of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
