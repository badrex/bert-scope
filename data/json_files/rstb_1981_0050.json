Protoplasts, single cells without cell walls, can be cloned, fused, and transformed, providing new methods for genetic manipulation. The author highlights the potential for protoplast cloning to enhance genetic variation in potatoes and other crop species, as well as the possibility of somatic hybridization between different species. The article also explores the use of protoplasts for transferring genes between species and the potential for molecular studies to improve our understanding of somatic variation in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
