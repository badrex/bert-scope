The authors developed a modified experimental apparatus to study the behavior of complex mixtures and analyzed the samples using a Bone-Newitt analysis apparatus. The results can be applied to improve the separation and utilization of coal gas constituents for various industrial processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Engineering"}
