The authors examine the alloys' structure at various temperatures and use chilling techniques to analyze their microscopic changes. They discuss the cooling curves and equilibrium diagrams, providing evidence for understanding the nature of these alloys. The research contributes to the knowledge of metallurgy and alloy chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
