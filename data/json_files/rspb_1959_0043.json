They suggest that chromatid breaks and isochromatid breaks are actually the result of incomplete intrachanges, rather than being primary biological changes. This hypothesis is tested by estimating the true proportion of chromatid breaks in root-tip cells of broad beans exposed to radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
