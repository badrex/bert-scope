They found that the uterine ova in both species have similar structures and that the oviparity is more balanced in the echidna hystrix compared to the ornithorhynchus. The author also observed the development of ova and the presence of marsupial structures in the echidna hystrix.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
