It explores the compressible behavior of liquids during impact, the stress waves and pressures generated, and the resulting damage mechanisms in various materials. The study compares liquid impact with solid-solid impact and explosive loading, highlighting the differences in stress pulses, fracture patterns, and damage caused.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
