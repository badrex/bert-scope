The author discusses the construction of spin eigenfunctions and the evaluation of matrix elements between them, leading to a new description of bonding and bond orders. The theory allows for a more rigorous approach to chemical bonding and can be developed along either ab initio or empirical lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
