They found that the muscle's water content remained constant over a range of vapor pressures, suggesting that bound water is present in muscle fibers. This study provides insight into muscle physiology and the behavior of bound water in biological materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
