It shows that nitrates reduce the number and size of nodules, and affect the growth and physiology of the host plant, potentially due to a reduction in available carbohydrates. The research focuses on understanding the mechanism of nitrate action on root infection and nodule formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
