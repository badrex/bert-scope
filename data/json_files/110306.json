The author, Professor Airy, used a method of variation of parameters to calculate the effects of this inequality on the geocentric longitude of Venus. The study found that the error in the longitude could range between 20\" and 30\" if the mean motions of the Earth and Venus were determined from observations made around Bradley's time.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
