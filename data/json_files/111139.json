He discusses his methods, data collection, and findings, comparing his results with those of Gauss and Erman. Kamtz also shares his thoughts on the horizontal component and the possible dependence of both components on the same constants. This work contributes to a better understanding of the earth's magnetic field and its variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
