The authors found that most materials reveal two distinct regions with different fracture mechanics parameters, linked by a transition zone. The fatigue life of virgin specimens can be predicted using the crack growth characteristics and the size of intrinsic flaws, which correspond to the polyethylene spherulites.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
