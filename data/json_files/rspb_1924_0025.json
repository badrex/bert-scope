They discovered that the \"tail\" is a muscular appendage present only in males, and the \"lateral organs\" are rod-like structures found in both sexes. The \"hyaline\" material in the lateral organs is formed from adjacent connective tissue and a transformation of connective tissue fibers. The study provides insights into the sexual dimorphism and anatomy of cuttlefish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
