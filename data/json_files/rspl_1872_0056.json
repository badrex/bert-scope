They found that the presence of air significantly slows down the rate of condensation, affecting the efficiency of surface condensers and steam engines. The study also suggests that introducing air into the boiler of a high-pressure engine could prevent condensation at the surface of the cylinder, improving efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
