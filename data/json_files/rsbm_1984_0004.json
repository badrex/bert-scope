Charnley's dedication to solving the problem of osteoarthritis of the hip led him to develop new surgical methods and collaborate with other disciplines. His contributions to orthopaedics, including closed treatment of fractures and compression arthrodesis, earned him the distinction of being the first practicing orthopaedic surgeon elected to the Fellowship of the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Orthopaedics"}
