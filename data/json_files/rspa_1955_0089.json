The authors propose that the flow of vehicles is a function of their concentration, and that slight changes in flow are propagated along the road as 'kinematic waves.' These waves can merge to form 'kinematic shock waves,' where vehicles must reduce speed suddenly. The theory is applied to predict the movement of traffic humps and hold-ups at bottlenecks, and is also relevant to pedestrian traffic.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Highway Engineering"}
