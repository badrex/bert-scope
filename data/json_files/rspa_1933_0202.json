They used a magnetic spectrograph to analyze the energies of the secondary cathode rays and compared their results with X-ray spectral data. The study aimed to improve the understanding of fundamental atomic constants and provide a more accurate measurement of atomic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
