He also shares his conjecture that Cochineil, a dye-producing insect, might be a type of Kermes. Lister's observations include the life cycle of Kermes, the different species of bees and wasps, and the role of mites in the process. He also mentions the possibility of different types of mites leading to different species of Kermes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
