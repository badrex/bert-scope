The authors found that as the zinc content increases, the amount of extension before fracture decreases. The alloys exhibit a yield point and tend to fracture in a single plane. The study also discusses the distortion measurements and the relation between the plane of fracture and the crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Crystals"}
