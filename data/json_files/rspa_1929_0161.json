The authors develop a theoretical framework using the Chapman-Enskog equation and the Sutherland and Lennard-Jones formulas to calculate the viscosity of gases. They apply this framework to the special case of argon and demonstrate the sensitivity of observed quantities to changes in molecular fields of force.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
