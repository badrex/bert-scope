The first reaction is a deceleratory, diffusion-controlled process where water is released from the superficial zones of the reactant crystals. The second reaction is a nucleation and growth process that leads to the formation of the crystalline anhydrous salt. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the chemistry of dehydrations of crystalline hydrates and their reaction mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid state chemistry"}
