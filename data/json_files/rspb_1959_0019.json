The authors focus on the sensory and motor pathways, analyzing the giant fibres and their connections. They found that the rapid conduction pathways in these worms are similar to those in some arthropods. The study provides insights into the transmission of excitation from sensory cells to motor cells and muscle fibers in these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
