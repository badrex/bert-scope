They found that these detachment processes play a significant role in removing negative ions from ionized media under certain conditions. The results also showed that the type of neutral gas with which the negative ion collides does not determine its detachment cross-section at these energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
