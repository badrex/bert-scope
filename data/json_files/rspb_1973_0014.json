Detailed analysis of numerous species demonstrates that while the meristic variation is wide, the numerical relations between stamen and ovule production are relatively similar. The author also observes that the relationships between stamen and ovule production are subject to genetic control, as evidenced by the phylogenetic adjustments in certain species. This study provides valuable insights into the structure and evolution of the ranunculaceous flower.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
