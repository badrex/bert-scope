The researchers found that the reflex response evoked by the second volley can be diminished, increased, or remain unchanged depending on the interval between the two volleys. The findings suggest that the reflex response may involve summation of the central effects of the two centripetal volleys, rather than just the refractory period of the reflex pathway.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
