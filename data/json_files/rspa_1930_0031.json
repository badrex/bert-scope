The authors discovered that a copper surface in the passive state exhibits a remarkable increase in the intensity of the attraction field due to a thin, tenuous surface film. This finding has implications for understanding the adhesion between dissimilar surfaces and the role of surface films in enhancing or reducing adhesion.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Surface Chemistry"}
