SF-1 plays a key role in the gene regulation of steroidogenic enzymes and is essential for adrenal and gonadal development. It also functions at the hypothalamic and pituitary levels of the reproductive axis, affecting the expression of several markers of pituitary gonadotropes and the formation of the ventromedial hypothalamic nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
