The author created a series of artificial stars with known intensity and color, and used various techniques to compare them to actual stars. The methods explored include reflection from a plane mirror, a modified Zollner's lamp, and adjusting the distance between a lamp and a ground blue glass. The results allowed for the calculation of the relative intensity of stars and the total quantity of light provided by them.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
