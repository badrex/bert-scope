It explores the effects of stranding and provides formulae for the effective resistance of coils, considering factors such as coil length, frequency, and wire section. The study aims to determine the conditions that minimize eddy-current losses and improve coil performance in high-frequency currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromagnetic Induction"}
