This allows for the inclusion of nuclear interactions in the Kemmer formulation and extends the particle formulation to particles with zero rest-mass, such as photons. The author also derives a general formula for the spur of a product of any number of matrices, which can be useful in future calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
