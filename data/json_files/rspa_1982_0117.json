They demonstrate that by using a priori knowledge of the support of the function, exponential components can be recovered with improved resolution. The study also discusses the singular values and singular functions of the Laplace transform and their properties, providing insights into the resolution limits achievable in the inversion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
