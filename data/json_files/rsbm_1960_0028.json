He is best known for his 1912 discovery of X-ray diffraction by crystals, which revolutionized our understanding of the solid state and laid the foundation for X-ray crystallography. Laue's work on the special theory of relativity and his influence on the development of atomic theory and X-ray spectroscopy further solidified his legacy in the world of physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
