It studies the dislocation trajectories and their connection to continuous wave diffraction patterns. The authors provide a two-dimensional model system to demonstrate the behavior of dislocations in pulses and continuous waves, and discuss the implications for remote sensing systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
