The research focuses on the external and internal morphology of the larvae, as well as their cleavage patterns, growth, and behavior. The findings contribute to the understanding of the life history and development of the Harrimanidae family, which has similarities to the indirect development of some Ptychoderidae members.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
