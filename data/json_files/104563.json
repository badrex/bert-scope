Byrom argues that Lodwick's alphabet is unnecessarily complex and proposes a simpler system with 20 consonants and 7 vowels. He also highlights the differences between English and French pronunciation and suggests that improving one's own language can be aided by studying other languages.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Linguistics"}
