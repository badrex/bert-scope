These spectacular coccolithophorids have unmineralized periplast components, which provide new insights into their morphology and taxonomy. The study highlights the importance of examining extant taxa to better understand fossil records and improve taxonomic classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
