The authors explain how fluorescence measurements can help determine the efficiency of photosystem II and the mechanisms of energy dissipation, such as non-photochemical quenching. They also present a model for the regulation of photosystem II, which involves three states and the conversion of active to inactive states.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
