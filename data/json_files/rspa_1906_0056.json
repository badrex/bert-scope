The author analyzes pressure observations from 95 stations worldwide and discovers that these regions exhibit variations of much longer duration than previously thought. The study provides insight into the relationship between barometric changes and their impact on weather patterns and climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
