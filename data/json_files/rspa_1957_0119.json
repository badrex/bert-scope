They found that the predominant internal conversion leaves the atoms in states of high multiple ionization. The mechanism of this multiple ionization is discussed in terms of successive Auger events. The study provides insights into the ionizing mechanisms and their effects on atoms during radioactive decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
