The study examines the responses of the ganglia to stimulation, latency, nerve response, and the conduction velocity of nerve fibers. The findings suggest the existence of an integration center in the abdominal ganglion and provide insights into the neural relationships in the ganglia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
