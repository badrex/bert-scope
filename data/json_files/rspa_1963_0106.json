The author compares the results with Hartree's numerical solution and finds better agreement when starting with a function that satisfies the boundary conditions at the plate. The study also explores the behavior of the solution at infinity and discusses the differences between the two methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
