A. Hirst and Professor Williamson on the existence of a magnetic medium and the properties of diamagnetism. Hirst argues that the method of argument adopted by Professor Tyndall can be applicable in various cases, even when the medium is supposed to fill the interstices of the body. However, he also shows that it is possible to attribute properties to the medium that avoid the conclusion contradictory to experimental facts. The article highlights the importance of understanding the properties of the internal medium to determine the behavior of magnetic and diamagnetic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
