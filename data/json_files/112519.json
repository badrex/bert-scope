A. L. O. Des Cloiseaux, conducted research on the optical properties of Harmotome and Wohlerite minerals. They discovered that both minerals belong to the clinorhombic (oblique) system, which was previously unknown. The study involved examining the orientation of the plane containing their optic axes and the different types of dispersion they presented. This research helped improve the crystallographic classification of these minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
