They focused on the interior solution expansion without considering the edge-zone solution expansion. The study complements Goodier's system of differential equations with a corresponding system of boundary conditions, improving the classical approximate interior solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics and Materials"}
