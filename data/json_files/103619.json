He used a linseed oil thermometer and two tin vessels to measure the expansion of the thermometer at different temperatures. He found that the expansion of the thermometer was accurately proportional to the quantity of hot water in the mixture, or the degree of heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
