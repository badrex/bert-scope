They used a flow method to measure the equilibrium constants and calculated the entropy changes to obtain the heat content changes. The results provide valuable information for understanding the heat of formation of ethyl halides and the bond dissociation energies of the Et-X bonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
