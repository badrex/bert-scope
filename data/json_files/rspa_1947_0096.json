The results show that the turbulence intensities are nearly equal except at the center of the wake, and the turbulent wake stabilizes after 100 diameters downstream. The study also reveals that the total kinetic energy of the turbulent motion and mean flow in the wake changes continuously, approaching a ratio in the limit."}
