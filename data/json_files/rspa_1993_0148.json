They analyze the diffusion of gaseous substances and the behavior of sensor arrays within the chamber, enabling the measurable and quantifiable definition of volatile molecular substances, even at very low gas concentrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Chemistry"}
