The research finds that the proportion of unhatched eggs in a clutch is related to the degree of genetic similarity between the parents. The results do not support the hypothesis that female blue tits engage in extra-pair copulations to reduce inbreeding depression. Instead, inbreeding may explain the occurrence of unhatched eggs in nests.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
