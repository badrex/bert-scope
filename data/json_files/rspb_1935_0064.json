They discuss various methods for determining the different forms of iron in sea water, such as ferrous and ferric ions, and analyze the distribution of iron in marine plankton. The study suggests that iron plays a crucial role in the growth of diatoms and other marine organisms, and that coastal waters have higher iron concentrations than oceanic waters due to runoff from land.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
