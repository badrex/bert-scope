The research shows that the transition from a single spike pattern to bursts of impulses during swimming occurs rapidly, between stages 37-38 and 42. The findings suggest that Xenopus swimming rhythmicity develops along a rostrocaudal gradient and may involve the acquisition of multiple spiking in spinal neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Neurobiology"}
