They found that the diffusion coefficient is largely determined by the mobilities of the ions in the dye solution. The study also showed that it is possible to obtain the particle size by applying the Stokes-Einstein equation when a large quantity of electrolyte is added to the dye solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
