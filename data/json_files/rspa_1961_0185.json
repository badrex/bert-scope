They found that these properties are influenced by the shape of the Fermi surface and the lattice spectrum. The Fermi surface is distorted in lithium, nearly spherical in sodium and potassium, and distorted again in rubidium and caesium. The study helps to explain discrepancies between standard theory and experimental results in alkali metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
