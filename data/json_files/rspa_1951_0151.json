The method uses the hypercircle principle and Green's functions to locate the solution on a hypercircle in function space, providing bounds for the solution and its derivatives. This method is applicable to various boundary-value problems in three-dimensional regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
