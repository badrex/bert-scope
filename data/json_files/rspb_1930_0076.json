This is different from other voluntary muscles in mammals, which only contract after their motor nerves have degenerated. The findings suggest that the eye muscles may use an ancient and primitive mechanism that other voluntary muscles have lost.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuromuscular Physiology"}
