They discuss the assumptions and limitations of the theory and analyze experimental results from tri-axial tests on sand. The study highlights the importance of understanding the behavior of granular materials in various applications, such as earth masses, retaining walls, and foundations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Geotechnical Engineering"}
