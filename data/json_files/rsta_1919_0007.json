The author explains the behavior of longitudinal and transversal waves upon reflection at the Earth's surface and provides mathematical equations to describe the resulting horizontal and vertical movements. The study helps in understanding the propagation of earthquake waves and their implications for determining the epicenters of earthquakes and inferring information about the Earth's interior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
