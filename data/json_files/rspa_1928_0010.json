The authors designed a precise apparatus to minimize convection effects and conducted experiments on a range of common liquids, such as water, glycerine, and benzene. They also discussed potential sources of error and corrections to be applied to the experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
