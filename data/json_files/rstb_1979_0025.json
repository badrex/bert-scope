The research explores the impact of factors such as rainfall, food supply, and habitat on the growth, mortality, and reproductive success of the Aldabran giant tortoise. The findings reveal differences in population densities, clutch sizes, and reproductive success between isolated populations on Grande Terre and Malabar, highlighting the importance of environmental conditions in regulating tortoise populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
