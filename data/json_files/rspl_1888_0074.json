It discusses the methods used to find the waves or oscillations on a gravitating mass of liquid that is rotating as a rigid body. The author applies Poincar\u00e9's methods to the case of a fluid spheroid, using tesseral or zonal harmonics to simplify the problem and determine the frequencies of the various free waves. The article also covers the stability of the liquid spheroid and the effects of external forces on the tides."}
