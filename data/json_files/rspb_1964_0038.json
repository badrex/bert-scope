The research focuses on the effects of substituents on carbon atoms 17, 19, 20, and 22. The findings suggest that icterogenicity is associated with the 22/\u03b2-angeloyloxy side chain, and esterification of the C(28) carboxyl or replacement of the side chain with a simple saturated fatty acid results in a loss of activity. The study provides insights into the understanding of the molecular mechanisms behind the icterogenic activity of triterpenes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
