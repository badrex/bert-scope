They discovered that pituitary extracts induce extreme melanophore expansion in frogs, and this effect is mainly due to the posterior lobe of the pituitary gland. This research provides insights into the role of the pituitary gland in pigmental response and color adaptation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
