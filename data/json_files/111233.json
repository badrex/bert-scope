They observed that at a certain height, the temperature remains constant or increases before resuming its downward course. The results showed that the rate of temperature diminution was nearly uniform within each section of the ascent, with a slightly greater rate in the lower section. The air collected during the ascents was analyzed, revealing a trace of carbonic acid and a slight decrease in oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
