The author reviews the basic theory of reconnection, the Sweet-Parker model, Petschek's mechanism, and the Vasyliunas' distinction between fast-mode and slow-mode expansions. The article also presents a unified theory of fast, steady, almost-uniform reconnection, which helps explain puzzling features of numerical experiments and accounts for many observational properties of solar flares.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
