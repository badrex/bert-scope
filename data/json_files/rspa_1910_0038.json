They determined the most probable angle of deflection for alpha particles by analyzing the distribution of scintillations on a zinc sulfide screen. Their findings provided insights into the nature of atomic interactions and laid the foundation for understanding nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
