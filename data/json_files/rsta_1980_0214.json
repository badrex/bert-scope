The research focuses on Nd, Sr, and Pb isotope data, as well as major and trace element data, to understand the source region of the lavas and the possible effects of contamination by continental crust. The findings suggest that recent metasomatism of the subcontinental mantle beneath Kenya could account for the observed heterogeneity."}
