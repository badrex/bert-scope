They found that nitric oxide inhibits the decomposition by breaking reaction chains, and the limiting rate represents the chain-free, primary process. The mean chain length and activation energy of the ethers were determined, providing insights into the decomposition mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
