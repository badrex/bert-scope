They discovered two different dinucleotides, one containing adenine and uracil, and the other containing guanine and cytosine. The study provides insight into the complex chemical composition of peat and the potential presence of nucleic acids in raw materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
