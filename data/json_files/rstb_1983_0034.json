The author explains the effects of adrenalin and insulin on the phosphorylation state of glycogen and the role of calcium ions in neural control. The article also reviews the structure, regulation, and substrate specificities of the protein phosphatases involved in glycogen metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
