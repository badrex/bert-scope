The research found that a single pathogen clone with a significant advantage in virulence can cause severe epidemics in genetically uniform crops. This contrasts with the natural genetic variation in plant populations that helps reduce the impact of diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
