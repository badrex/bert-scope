The authors explore the role of diffusion and recombination processes in chain ending mechanisms during gas explosions. They propose an equation to determine the equilibrium concentration of free radicals in the gaseous mixture.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
