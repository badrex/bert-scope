They found that the machine's accuracy was less affected by the vessel's speed and that it could be improved by reducing its resistance and using a spiral spring to break the jerks of the waves. The author suggests that the ship's log may be less accurate in slow-moving vessels due to the log hauling the line, causing it to follow the ship.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Marine technology"}
