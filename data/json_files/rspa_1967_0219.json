They found that at high magnetic field strengths, oscillatory disturbances can become more critical for the flow's stability. The research applies to incompressible, conducting fluids between coaxial, rotating cylinders under an axially applied magnetic field. The study considers three different flow conditions: rotating inner wall with a stationary outer wall, counterrotating walls, and corotating walls.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
