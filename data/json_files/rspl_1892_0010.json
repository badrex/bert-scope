He observed that during sleep, even slight sensory stimuli can cause a slight increase in brain temperature. The brain's temperature can also be affected by various anaesthetics and narcotics, which may suspend the chemical functions of nerve cells. Mosso concluded that the physical basis of psychical processes is likely chemical action.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
