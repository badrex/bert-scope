They discovered two upper states, B0+ and a new lower lying state, A0+. The vibrational levels in B0+ are subject to numerous small perturbations, while the levels in A0+ extrapolate smoothly to a limit at about 25920 cm^-1 above v\" = 0. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and dissociation energy of Te2.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
