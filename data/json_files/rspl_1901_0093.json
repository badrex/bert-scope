The test involves producing anti-sera for different blood types and observing the reactions when mixed with various animal blood samples. This test has the potential to aid in the study of animal classification and differentiate between human and monkey blood, which could be important in medico-legal cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
