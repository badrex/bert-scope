They conducted experiments by calcining slat and found that it turns into a yellow ochre, which suggests that some yellow and orange-colored sediments found in fountains may come from slat rather than iron ores. The author also mentions their intention to further investigate the properties of slat and its reaction with magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
