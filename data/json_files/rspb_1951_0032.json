The research shows that attractive perfumes can stimulate bees to explore and enter flowers, regardless of whether they have learned to associate the scent with food. The findings support previous conclusions about honeybee behavior and indicate that perfume plays a crucial role in attracting bees to potential food sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
