This device allows for precise observations of star positions, overcoming issues with estimation and star motion. By comparing the observed time with rhythmic time signals, the Global Standard Time of a star's appearance can be determined, leading to more accurate longitude calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
