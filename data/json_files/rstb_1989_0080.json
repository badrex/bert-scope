The authors report falling incidence of gonorrhea, hepatitis B, and syphilis in homosexual men, with the changes most marked from 1985 onwards. Data on temporal trends in HIV prevalence and incidence in homosexual men suggest that the maximum incidence of HIV infection occurred in 1982-84 and may have fallen since then. Evidence from various sources points to a recent change in sexual behavior characterized by a reduction in the number of partners and the adoption of safer sexual practices.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Public Health"}
