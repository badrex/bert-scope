The results show that when solutes have a close chemical relationship, their compressibility curves are more similar, while when there is no chemical relationship, the curves are more widely spaced. This suggests that the nature of the solute molecule has an impact on the compressibility of the solvent, water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution Chemistry"}
