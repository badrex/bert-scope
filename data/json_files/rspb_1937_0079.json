The research aims to define experimental conditions that conform to the phases of the normal cycle and result in uterine bleeding at approximately 4-weekly intervals in ovariectomized rhesus monkeys treated with both oestrin and progestin. The findings contribute to understanding the menstrual cycle and the role of hormones in it.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
