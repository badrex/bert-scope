They measured the drag torque over a wide range of Knudsen numbers from continuum to free molecule flow and found that the drag under free molecule conditions was consistent with the assumption of perfectly diffuse reflection of molecules at the surface of the rotor. An approximate theory was derived, which is valid for low Mach and Reynolds numbers, and was found to agree with the experimental results within 10% in the range investigated.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
