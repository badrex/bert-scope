They found that diphtheria antitoxin is not a globulin but belongs to the albumin group, which makes up about 85% of the total protein in serum. The authors also discovered that the presence of antitoxin affects the form of the alcohol precipitation curve, suggesting that it is something added to the normal proteins of serum and not just a normal protein with an antitoxic group attached to it.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
