The authors collected rock samples and used acoustic surveying methods to determine the age and composition of the various layers. The boomer and sparker equipment proved valuable in correcting geological boundaries and providing information on the thickness of major stratigraphical divisions. The study found that the methods of geological and geophysical investigations were complementary and could aid in determining the structure of the sea-bed.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
