The study focuses on the nearly two-dimensional nature of the flow in the core, leading to approximate but explicit formulae for the propagation speed and shape of the vortex rings. The findings contribute to the understanding of vortex motion and have implications for the study of thermals and other fluid dynamics phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
