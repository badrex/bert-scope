They find that the conductivity is lowest when the glass is an exact chemical compound. Additionally, the author presents a new electrical storage battery design using a copper case, a lead amalgamated plate, and a solution of cupric sulfate with hydric sulfate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
