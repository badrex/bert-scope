The system consists of a linear array of sodium atomic beams in a low finesse Fabry-Perot etalon. Although preliminary results show low branch to high branch switching, there is no evidence of the expected nutational oscillations. The most plausible reason for the non-appearance of Rabi oscillations is that the light field inside the cavity is not switching on fast enough to obtain a coherent transient.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Optical Physics"}
