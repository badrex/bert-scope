Injecting cholesterol into mice resulted in the development of sarcomas at the injection site. The study supports the conclusion that cholesterol itself is the carcinogen in commercial cholesterol, rather than any associated impurities. The research also shows that the oil used as a solvent in these experiments is necessary for the carcinogenic activity of cholesterol.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Oncology and Cancer Research"}
