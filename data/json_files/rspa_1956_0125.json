The authors explain how the main absorbing constituents of the atmosphere, water vapor and CO2, cause deep bands in the infra-red spectrum. They describe a program of high-altitude spectroscopy to record the solar spectrum out into the far infra-red from a Canberra aircraft flying at high altitudes. The study aims to provide valuable information about the atmosphere's radiation balance and the role of clouds in the radiative pattern."}
