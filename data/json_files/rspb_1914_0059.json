They found that the strain was similar to other strains causing disease in humans, wild game, and wild Glossina morsitans. The infection in various animals, including dogs, monkeys, and rats, showed symptoms and pathological changes similar to those caused by other strains. The study suggests that wild Glossina morsitans in a district 100 miles south of the \"Proclaimed Area\" are infected with the trypanosome causing human trypanosome disease in Nyasaland.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
