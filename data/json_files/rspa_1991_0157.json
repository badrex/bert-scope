The model predicts the various modes of breakup and the size and number of droplets produced, considering energy and entropy principles. The study focuses on the effects of impact energy on the state of droplet sizes after shattering, providing a framework for understanding drop breakup and subsequent size distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
