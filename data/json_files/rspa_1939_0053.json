The researchers found that the rate of exchange is independent of the ethylene pressure and directly proportional to the hydrogen pressure. They also determined that the energy of activation for the exchange reaction is temperature-dependent, which is similar to the findings for hydrogenation reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
