The authors conducted experiments on various solutions, including cane sugar and mineral water crystals, to study osmotic pressure and its relationship with solution dynamics. They also developed a new method for determining osmotic pressures and molecular weights of substances. The findings contribute to a better understanding of osmotic pressure and its role in solution chemistry."}
