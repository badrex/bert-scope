The researchers use a high-speed cine microscope to observe the burning process and measure combustion speeds. They find that crystal size and initial temperature significantly affect the burning speed, and discuss the role of crystal defects in the combustion and explosion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
