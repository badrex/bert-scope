The author reconstructs a new sunspot catalogue using various sources, including official histories and local gazettes, and analyzes the power spectrum of solar activity. The study reveals the significance of the 10.62-year Schwabe cycle and the potential influence of a 210-year cycle on solar activity and future forecasting.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeoastronomy"}
