They find that these nuclei can cause the solutions to solidify, and that their activity is influenced by atmospheric conditions, particularly wind direction. The author also discusses the role of heat in activating or deactivating these nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
