It suggests that bats that feed on small aerial insects tend to emerge earlier to take advantage of the peak flight activity at dusk, while bats adapted to feed on other prey types emerge later to minimize predation risk. The findings provide insights into the factors influencing bat emergence times and their adaptations to avoid predation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
