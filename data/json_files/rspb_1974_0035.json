This structure is found in reprecipitated cartilage collagen and is likely the five-stranded microfibril suggested by Smith (1968). The findings contribute to our understanding of the arrangement of collagen molecules within filaments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
