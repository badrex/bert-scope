They observed the transformation of spherical bubbles into lenticular shapes and investigated the factors influencing this change. The results showed that the bubbles' shape change is due to the interaction between silica particles, water, and hydrogen peroxide, which forms a compound called persilicic acid. This compound decomposes continuously as the gel sets, controlling the shape of the bubbles based on the internal structure of the gel.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
