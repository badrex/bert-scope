They discover that sensitive discharges are produced by rapid succession of small, instantaneous discharges of free electricity from the terminals of the tube. The effects produced by a conductor approaching a tube containing a sensitive discharge are due to the sudden and instantaneous character of the component discharge. The study of sensitive and continuous discharges provides insight into the relationship between the electric arc and the electric spark.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
