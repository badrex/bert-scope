The author conducts experiments on a model crack system, which demonstrates that the toughness of a composite material with periodic stiffness changes along the crack path can be significantly greater than the toughness of its individual components. The findings have implications for designing tough composite structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
