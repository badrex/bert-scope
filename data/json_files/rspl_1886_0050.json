Norman Lockyer, discusses the observations of sunspot spectra made at Kensington from November 1879 to August 1885. They found that as the sunspot cycle progresses from minimum to maximum, the lines of certain chemical elements gradually disappear, and unknown lines appear. This supports the hypothesis that the solar atmosphere's composition changes during the sunspot cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
