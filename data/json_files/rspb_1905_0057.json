The results showed that sheep that underwent a process of artificial stimulation during the sexual season had a higher percentage of lambs and lower percentages of barren and aborted ewes. Flushing with turnips was found to bring ewes in season rapidly, and twins were mostly born early during lambing time. The study also found that increased fertility may be characteristic of certain particular ewes, and fertility is a character that can be inherited.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Reproduction"}
