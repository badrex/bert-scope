They found that the relative amounts of deutero-ammonias formed were independent of the catalyst used. The study also provided insights into the activation energies and frequency factors for the reaction on different metals. The results contribute to understanding the influence of electronic and geometrical properties of catalysts on the efficiency of chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
