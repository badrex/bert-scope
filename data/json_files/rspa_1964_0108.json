They find that spin-wave excitations of small wave vector occur with energies proportional to the temperature, leading to an analytical expression for the constant that differs from the Heisenberg model. This work provides a consistent explanation of ferromagnetism within the band theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
