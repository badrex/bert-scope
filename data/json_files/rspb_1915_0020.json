They found that increasing surface area led to a distinct retardation in the inversion of cane sugar by invertase when the substrate concentration was relatively high and the ferment concentration was low. This suggests that surface tension may affect the combination of enzyme and substrate, as well as the chemical change that occurs in the substrate under the influence of the ferment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
