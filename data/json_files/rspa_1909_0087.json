The authors prepared anhydrous hydrogen fluoride and measured its conductivity and density at various concentrations. They also determined the purity of the acid and developed a method for titrating hydrogen fluoride using potassium hydrate and phenol-phthalein as an indicator. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of hydrogen fluoride's properties and its potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
