They recorded the temperature of the rocks using thermometers placed in the tunnel's side wall and observed a maximum temperature of 54.5\u00b0C. The authors also discussed the challenges faced, such as the high temperatures in the advanced headings and the presence of hot water \"feeders.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
