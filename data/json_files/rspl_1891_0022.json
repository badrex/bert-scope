The authors found that the emissivity increases with a decrease in wire diameter and an increase in temperature. They also discovered that the emissivity of platinum wires of different diameters at the same temperature can be expressed by a constant plus a constant into the reciprocal of the wire's diameter. This research has implications for electrical engineers working with glow lamps, hot-wire voltmeters, and fuses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
