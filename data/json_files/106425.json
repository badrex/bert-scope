They found that the air extracted from zinc and iron was fatal to animals, even when passed through water or quicksilver. Fontana also discovered that the air was not harmless when breathed through the mouth alone, debunking previous claims by Mr. Sheele. The author proposed that the inflammable air might affect the body of animals in ways not yet understood by philosophers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
