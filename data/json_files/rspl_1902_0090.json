They analyze the energy components, including the electrokinetic energy and the energy of magnetization in the field, and explore the potential mechanical effectiveness of magnetic energy. The author also considers the role of magnetic energy in processes like hysteresis and the availability of magnetic energy for work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
