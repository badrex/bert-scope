He advocates for a thermo-electric method using galvanometers and photographic recorders, and describes the improvements in apparatus that have facilitated these investigations. The author also presents the \"thread recorder\" of Horace Darwin for quasi-continuous registration in clinical settings.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Thermometry"}
