The most stable states for electrons are those with negative energy and high velocity. Holes in the distribution of negative-energy electrons are considered as protons, simplifying the need for two fundamental particles. The theory provides symmetry between electrons and protons, but a mathematical dissymmetry arises when considering their interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
