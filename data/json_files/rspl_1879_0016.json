They demonstrate how to find the values of certain equations and coefficients, and discuss the boundary conditions and expansion forms for the problem. The paper also includes a proof of a key theorem and the calculation of coefficients for the expansion of certain functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
