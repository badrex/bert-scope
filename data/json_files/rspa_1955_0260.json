They study inductive and electromeric displacements in conjugated molecules, providing insights into energy stabilization and charge distribution changes. The theory is applied to inductive substituents in benzene and electromeric displacements in furan, pyrrole, aniline, and phenol.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
