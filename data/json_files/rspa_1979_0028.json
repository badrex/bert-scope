They transform these equations into one-dimensional wave equations for odd and even parity perturbations, showing a simple relation between solutions of opposite parities. This work provides a better understanding of the conversion of gravitational and electromagnetic energy in spacetimes described by the Einstein-Maxwell equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
