The complex scales of these organisms show variations on a basic form and have unique internal structures. The researchers used electron microscopy to study the cells and describe four species within the Luffisphaera genus. The relationship of these organisms to other species remains unclear, but they may be related to the Chrysophyceae or Chrysomonadida.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
