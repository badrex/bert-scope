They demonstrate a method to record the quantitative relations between the distances of successive leaves and discuss the inherent features that govern the arrangement of leaves. The author also explores the increase and decrease of internode lengths in plants and their relation to external factors, concluding that the cause is inherent rather than due to variations in temperature, illumination, or water supply.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
