They found that the growth patterns were not affected by light or temperature, but were influenced by the medium's thickness and the presence of reflecting surfaces. This research sheds light on the chemotactic and physiotactic properties of protoplasm and has implications for understanding microbial growth patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
