They develop a transformation that reconciles long parallel wavelength, short perpendicular wavelength, and periodicity in a sheared toroidal magnetic field. The transformation allows for an eikonal representation of the perturbation, which is then used to analyze the stability of the plasma. The lowest-order theory determines the local oscillation frequency and structure of the mode along the magnetic field, while higher-order theories determine the transverse structure and the relation between the local and true eigenvalues.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
