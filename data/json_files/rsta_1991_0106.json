It discusses the focal mechanisms of earthquakes, which indicate the directions of principal stress axes, and compares them with the stresses predicted by plate driving-force models. The study finds that lithosphere older than 35 million years is in deviatoric compression, which can constrain the basal drag on plates and hence mantle viscosity. The absence of a broad zone of ridge-normal extension in younger lithosphere suggests that the ridge axis is rheologically weak. The focal depths of earthquakes can be combined with thermal models and rock mechanics to constrain the rheology of the lithosphere, both in plate interiors and at plate boundaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
