They derive a new exact dispersion model that accounts for dispersion with interphase transport and introduce the concept of an 'exchange coefficient.' This coefficient depends on the rate of interfacial transport and affects the convection and dispersion coefficients significantly. The study provides a better understanding of practical mass and heat transfer problems involving interphase transfer.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
