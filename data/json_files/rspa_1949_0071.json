They discussed the theory of evaporation using a model of the liquid surface consisting of a compact ordered layer with a mobile adsorbed layer of molecules above it. The results suggest that evaporation takes place mainly by direct exchange of molecules between the ordered layer and the vapor.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
