They study the genetic relationship between this strain and other related species, concluding that Botrytis cinerea is not a developmental phase within the life-cycle of Sclerotinia. The author also discusses the possibility of genetic changes in the fungus and the importance of single-spore strains in understanding its behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fungal Genetics"}
