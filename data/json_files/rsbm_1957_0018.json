He is best known for his first direct determination of the elementary ionic charge and his extensive research on the electric properties of gases released by the electrolysis of liquids. His work on the diffusion of ions in gases and the measurement of secondary radiation emitted from various substances when irradiated by X-rays also had a lasting impact on the field of physics."}
