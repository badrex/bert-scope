The researchers found that T cells can recognize and distinguish between the two isoforms, which have different insertions in the a-subunit of the AChR. This discovery provides insights into the autoimmune nature of myasthenia gravis and the role of T cells in recognizing and responding to the AChR isoforms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
