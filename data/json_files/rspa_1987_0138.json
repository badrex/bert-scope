The authors develop a numerical method that combines a finite-element approximation of the velocity potential near the cylinder with a boundary integral equation representation of the outer region. The results show excellent agreement with analytical solutions and reveal the influence of forward speed on the hydrodynamic forces acting on the submerged cylinder.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
