Davy investigates the composition and properties of fire-damp, an inflammable gas found in coal mines. He discovers that it is primarily composed of carburetted hydrogen and suggests methods for lighting coal mines safely to prevent explosions. Davy proposes using a safe lantern with limited air supply and a chimney to prevent communication with external air, as well as other designs for mine lighting.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mining and Mineral Resources"}
