He found that sea water ice took longer to form and lasted longer than fresh water ice. He also suggested that the nitre found in Egypt might be formed from the urine of animals living in saltwater lakes, as the composition of the water in these lakes is similar to that of factitious Sal Armoniac.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Cryology"}
