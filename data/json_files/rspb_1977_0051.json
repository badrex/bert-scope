They found that under suitable conditions, a suppression effect similar to that observed at the squid synapse can be demonstrated at the vertebrate neuromuscular junction. This phenomenon is attributed to the interposition of an electric potential barrier that opposes the entry of calcium ions, which are the normal prerequisite for transmitter release.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
