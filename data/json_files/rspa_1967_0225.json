They investigated the optical properties, crystal structure, and infrared spectra of sodium, potassium, thallous, silver, and mercury fulminate salts. The results showed that while sodium, potassium, and thallous fulminates are ionic solids, the mercury salt is covalent, and the silver salt likely has a high degree of directed bonding in the solid state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
