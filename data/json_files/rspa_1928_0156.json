They found that most of the total emission from metals consists of electrons with energies of a few volts only. The authors also developed a new method to measure the current flowing to the collector for different magnetic field values, which helped them determine the number of electrons with specific velocities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Radiation"}
