The authors construct periodic level surfaces based on cubic space groups and compare their accuracy with constant mean curvature surfaces. They demonstrate the utility of these models in analyzing experimentally observed block copolymer morphologies and simulating projections for comparison with transmission electron micrographs.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
