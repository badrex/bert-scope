They found that spores were not killed by temperature but were killed by direct solar rays. The experiments showed that the growth medium was still capable of supporting bacterial growth after exposure to sunlight, proving that the effects were not due to spoiled substrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
