It examines the processes occurring in the different layers of peat and how the water table affects these processes. The study finds that methane and carbon dioxide are produced in the deeper, anoxic layers of peat and are transported upwards through diffusion. The efflux of these gases from peatlands to the atmosphere is influenced by the water table and the heterogeneity of the peatland surface, with hummocks and hollows showing different rates of gas emission. The research provides insights into the complex processes occurring in peatlands and their role in the global carbon and methane cycles.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Biogeochemistry"}
