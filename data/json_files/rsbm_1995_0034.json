Zuckerman's early interest in baboon social behavior led him to study their reproductive cycles and hormonal changes. His work on simulating menstrual cycles using hormones and his research on the influence of nervous stimuli on cyclicity were significant milestones in the field. Zuckerman also played a crucial role in establishing the Journal of Endocrinology and contributed to the understanding of primate taxonomy and phylogeny.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology and Endocrinology"}
