The authors consider various ecological contexts, such as foraging flight, food transportation flight, migration flight, and aerial display flight. They identify optimization criteria and immediate currencies relevant for these flight situations, allowing them to derive optimal flight speeds. Generally, optimal flight speeds are faster when birds aim to maximize the net energy intake rate rather than the foraging gain ratio.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
