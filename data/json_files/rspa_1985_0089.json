The authors derive three-term asymptotic expansions for the radiated wave amplitude using matched asymptotic expansions and reciprocity principles. The results are applied to a circular cylinder and a hemisphere, providing insights into the behavior of water waves in the presence of oscillating bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
