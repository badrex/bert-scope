The results show that while prolan alone stimulates ovarian development, the combination with anterior pituitary extract does not lead to significant restoration of atrophied ovaries and accessory organs. This research highlights the complex interplay between pituitary and placental substances in regulating ovary function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
