They discovered that the secondary radiation emitted by lead had a continuous spectrum and was not solely due to Compton scattering. The results suggested that the nucleus plays a role in the absorption process and that the energy difference between the absorbed quantum and the nucleus in the excited state may involve the expenditure of additional energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
