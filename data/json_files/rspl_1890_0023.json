They found that bile salts, such as taurocholate and glycocholate, enhance the amylolytic action of pancreatic amylase on starch digestion. Additionally, they discovered that carbonate of sodium and leucin can interfere with pancreatic digestion, while bile salts can counteract this effect. The study also explored the influence of bile on proteolytic digestion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Digestive System"}
