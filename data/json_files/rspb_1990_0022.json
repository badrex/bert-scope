They find that both peptides form ion channels in planar lipid bilayers, with type I activity characterized by discrete channel openings and multiple conductance levels, and type II activity by transient increases in bilayer conductance. The ion channels formed by these peptides may be modeled in terms of bundles of transmembrane alpha-helices, providing insights into the ionophoric properties of alpha-helix bundles in channel proteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry and Molecular Biology"}
