The research found that Pseudocalanus elongatus and Acartia clausi were the most abundant species, while Calanus finmarchicus contributed the most to the total zooplankton biomass. The highest zooplankton standing stocks were found above the thermocline in the stratified region between April and June, and the frontal region had little influence on the distribution of zooplankton.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Biology"}
