They discovered unusual features in the bands, which they attributed to unresolved nuclear magnetic hyperfine doubling in the ground state. This study provides a detailed interpretation of the magnetic hyperfine interactions in diatomic molecules, with implications for understanding electronic states and transitions involving case states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
