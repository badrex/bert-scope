Bateson's research on variation and discontinuity in variation led him to challenge the prevailing views on evolution and species. He emphasized the importance of studying variation itself to better understand heredity and its impact on species. Despite facing opposition from his peers, Bateson's work laid the foundation for the rediscovery of Mendel's principles of heredity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Genetics"}
