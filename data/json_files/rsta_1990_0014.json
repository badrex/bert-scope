The author describes a mechanism called configuration mixing, which involves the interaction of a high-spin excited state to stabilize ferromagnetic coupling. This mechanism is applied to various electron configurations, leading to the identification of configurations that stabilize ferromagnetic coupling for specific directions of charge transfer. The article also presents experimental evidence of ferromagnetic behavior in molecular compounds, such as decamethylferrocenium tetracyanoethylenide (TCNE), and discusses the magnetic properties of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
