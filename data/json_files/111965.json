The authors found that the conducting power or resistance of a metal does not decrease or increase in direct ratio to the temperature. They also discovered that metalloids conduct electricity better when heated than when cold. The behavior of tellurium is found to be intermediate between that of metals and metalloids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
