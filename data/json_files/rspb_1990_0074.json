Researchers found that both types of excitatory input to adult Purkinje cells, parallel fibers, and climbing fibers, are mediated exclusively by glutamate receptors of the non-NMDA type, and that these cells entirely lack NMDA receptors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
