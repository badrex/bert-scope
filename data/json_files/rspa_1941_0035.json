The authors calculate the vibrations and force constants for both molecules, finding that the C-N bond in urea has approximately 28% double-bond character, while the guanidinium ion has complete resonance with each C-N bond having single-bond character. The study provides insights into the electronic structure and bonding of these molecules, which can be useful for understanding their chemical behavior and properties."}
