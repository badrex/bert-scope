The authors construct a map of the potential field between the crystal surface and the helium atom, and use this information to understand the energy levels and wave functions of the adsorbed helium. They also study the lateral migration of helium atoms in the adsorbed state, finding that even at low energies, migration occurs due to the periodic nature of the surface field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface chemistry"}
