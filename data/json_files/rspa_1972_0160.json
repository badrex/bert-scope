They use complex variable techniques and numerical methods to improve the accuracy of the finite-difference solution near the singularity. The study is applied to a specific free boundary problem involving fluid percolation through a porous dam, providing numerical results for comparison.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
