It explores the factors contributing to this enrichment, such as food supply from sedimenting organic material, and the role of resuspension in distributing organic matter throughout the layer. The article also highlights the unique communities and adaptations found in this environment, including chemosynthetic activity at hydrothermal vents and seeps.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
