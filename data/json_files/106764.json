They found that water gains weight when it freezes, which may be due to an increase in the attraction of gravitation or the absorption of a substance through the glass container. The author also proposed a pendulum experiment to further investigate the cause of the weight gain.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
