They discuss their initial struggles with understanding conduction in metals and how they used quantum mechanics to explain the behavior of electrons in crystals. This led to the development of the concept of Bloch waves, which became a fundamental part of solid state physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
