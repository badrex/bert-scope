The research also reveals that the characteristic time for melting depends on the temperature and morphology of the particles. Platelet-shaped bismuth particles exhibit a significant time delay, allowing some to be superheated by up to 7K above the bulk melting point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
