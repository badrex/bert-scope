The study reveals rapid polar motion between 750 and 400 million years ago and suggests that Gondwanaland was a unified landmass at least as far back as 750 million years ago. The findings support the view that Precambrian orogenic belts were of ensialic origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism and Paleomagnetism"}
