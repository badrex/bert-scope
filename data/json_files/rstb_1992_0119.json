The scheme is based on a mathematical analysis of first-order spatial properties of optical flow, such as singular points and elementary components, which are shown to be salient features for the computation and analysis of visual motion. The paper discusses the implications of this analysis on the design of artificial systems and the understanding of how the brain analyzes visual motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Neuroscience"}
