They observed that lightning flashes typically consist of multiple strokes, with the first stroke being more intense and heavily branched. The researchers also found that the time intervals between strokes vary greatly, ranging from 0.0006 seconds to 0.53 seconds. Their findings provide a better understanding of the nature and development of lightning discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Electricity"}
