They found that the sodium pump contributes to the resting potential and that its importance depends on the membrane resistance. The study provides evidence for the electrogenicity of the sodium pump in smooth muscle cells under steady-state conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
