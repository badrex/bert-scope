They explore the relationship between the thickness of the oxide film and the colors it produces, and they discuss the methods used to study these films, such as cathodic treatment in dilute hydrochloric acid. The author also addresses objections to the interference theory raised by other researchers and provides evidence supporting the interference explanation for the colors in thin films on metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
