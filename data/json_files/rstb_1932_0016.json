The author examines the cuticular structure and morphology of these plants, which were once thought to be ferns but are now known to be seed-bearing plants. The research contributes to the understanding of the nature and affinities of Mesozoic floras and the relationship between these plants and modern gymnosperms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
