The study presents a detailed map and description of the complex, along with the results of 20 new whole-rock chemical analyses. The complex features a large Cauldron Complex with a subsided block of basement rocks overlain by volcanic rocks and a ring-fracture zone. The study classifies the Cauldron Complex as a 'Valles type' of caldera volcano, and discusses the smaller Tuleih Complex, which includes a quartz-syenite boss and a variety of smaller intrusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Igneous Rocks and Volcanoes"}
