They found that around 220 species of Chlorophyta and Rhodophyta can be credited to the Solomon Islands. The authors also discussed the biogeographical aspects, ecological observations, and the distribution of Sargassum and encrusting coralline algae in the region. The study highlights the importance of encrusting coralline algae in reef development and the influence of wave action on reef ecology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
