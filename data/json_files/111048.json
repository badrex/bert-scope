He found that the transpiration velocity of hydrogen gas is double that of nitrogen gas, and the transpiration time of oxygen is inversely proportional to its density when compared to nitrogen. This research helped to understand the fundamental properties of gases and their behavior in various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas dynamics"}
