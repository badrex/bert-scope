The authors explore various techniques for constructing superconformal models and the use of conformal field theory in understanding the complex nature of these models. They also touch upon the importance of modular invariance and the role of superconformal symmetry in the search for a viable vacuum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
