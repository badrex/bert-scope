The researchers found that at normal resting potential, a short pulse of acetylcholine causes a monophasic depolarization. However, at a lower resting potential, biphasic potential changes (depolarization-hyperpolarization) occur. The ionic mechanism behind the secondary hyperpolarization is not yet clear, but it is not caused by the Na-K pump, as strophanthin-G does not affect it. The study suggests that the secondary hyperpolarization might be due to a change in membrane permeability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
