The authors investigate the process of capture through various mechanisms, including changes in solar eccentricity and lunar distances due to meteoritic bombardment. They also examine the role of tidal friction in altering the Moon's orbit and the importance of considering the angular momentum of incoming and outgoing meteoritic material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
