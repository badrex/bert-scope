They discovered that gas vesicles can rapidly diffuse gases and survive rapid pressure changes. The study provides a minimum estimate of the permeability of gas vesicles to gases, suggesting that they have many pores allowing for gas diffusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
