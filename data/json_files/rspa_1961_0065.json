They obtain exact self-consistent results for the density and potential distribution around an impurity to first order in perturbation theory, covering a density range sufficient for all metals under normal conditions. This approach reveals long-range oscillations in the self-consistent density and potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
