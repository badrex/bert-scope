It explains the processes involved in cation exchange reactions and the impact of acid deposition on soil and water composition. The author suggests that detailed soil-water investigations are necessary to understand the effects of acid deposition on lake and stream water composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Chemistry"}
