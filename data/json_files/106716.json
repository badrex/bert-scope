They discovered that exposing silk to sunlight in water led to the production of a gas with a higher degree of purity than air produced by plants. The author also detailed the process of using an eudiometer to measure the volume and quality of the produced gas, and discussed the factors affecting the quantity and quality of the gas produced.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Laws"}
