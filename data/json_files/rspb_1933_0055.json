They find that veratrine causes a prolonged production of heat in response to a single shock, with the total amount of heat being much greater than in a normal nerve. The study also shows that the efficiency of recovery varies under different conditions, and that complete asphyxia and recovery can enhance the veratrine effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nerve Physiology"}
