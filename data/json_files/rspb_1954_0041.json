They found that the activity alternated as each series was ascended, and that /?-oxidation of the side-chain might occur within plant tissue. The results suggest that the presence of certain substituents can hinder /?-oxidation and affect the growth-regulating properties of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
