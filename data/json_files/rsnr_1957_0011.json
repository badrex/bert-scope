Sherrington's work focused on the study of reflexes, the role of afferent and efferent nerve fibers, and the concept of reciprocal innervation. His research on the stretch reflex and the integrative action of the nervous system has had a lasting impact on the field of neurology. Sherrington's work laid the foundation for modern neuroscience and his influence can still be seen in the study of the nervous system today.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
