He explains how the ciliary muscle and capsule of the lens work together to focus light at different distances. Archer also discusses the role of the polygonal cells of Virchow and the elasticity of the capsule in maintaining the eye's ability to adapt to different focal lengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
