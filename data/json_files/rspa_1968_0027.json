They discovered that the thermal resistivity changes depending on the direction of the magnetic field, with a maximum resistivity observed in certain conditions. The results are explained by assuming that direct process phonon-spin interactions scatter specific bands of phonons, and a statistical theory is used to calculate the thermal resistivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
