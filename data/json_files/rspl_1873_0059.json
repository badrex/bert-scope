He discovered that sound can pass through the interstices of solid bodies as long as the continuity of the air is preserved. Tyndall also explored the use of sudden flashes, obtained by combustion or electric lights, as fog signals. These findings have implications for firemen's respirators and fog-related safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
