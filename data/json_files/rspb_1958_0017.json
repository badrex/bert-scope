This pigment is found in deep-sea fish and silver freshwater eels as well. The study compares the absorption of light by photosensitive pigments in solution and in intact retinae, providing insights into the conger eel's vision and the visual systems of other deep-sea creatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
