They discovered at least seven antigens, some of which may be important for the pathogenicity of the organism. The study found that avirulent strains lack one or more of these antigens and that the envelope antigen, which protects mice from plague infection, is present in greater amounts in virulent strains. This research helps to understand the immunological behavior of Pasteurella pestis and its potential applications in vaccine development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
