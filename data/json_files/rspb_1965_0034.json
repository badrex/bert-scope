The results show that the weight and girth of denervated muscle bellies grow to about 30% of their control counterparts, while the thickness of their tendons grows to approximately 75%. When a muscle is completely excised, its tendon grows to 85% of the control's girth. The research highlights the importance of mechanical stimuli and muscle-tendon junction structure in tendon growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
