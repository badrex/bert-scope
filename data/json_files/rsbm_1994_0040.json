Mitchell's work transformed the field of bioenergetics and had widespread ramifications in cell biology. His research focused on understanding the properties of biological membranes and the mechanisms of energy transfer, leading to the discovery of chemiosmosis and the role of ATP synthase in energy production.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
