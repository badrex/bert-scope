The authors set up a secular determinant using Launay's method, which takes the electron gas into account, and calculate frequencies for 47 points in the first Brillouin zone. The specific heat is then calculated using numerical computation, showing good agreement with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
