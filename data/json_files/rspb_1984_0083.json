They found that desensitization of the acetylcholine-induced current in response to microperfused acetylcholine occurred in two phases and was best modeled as the sum of two exponential components plus a constant. The results demonstrate that the onset of desensitization of this ACh response involves at least two processes that are dose- and temperature-sensitive, showing a fundamental difference between Aplysia neurons and the vertebrate neuromuscular junction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
