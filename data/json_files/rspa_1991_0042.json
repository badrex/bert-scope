The method provides direct relations between the couple and rotation vectors, stress, strain, and rotation concentrations on the ellipsoidal surface without solving the equations of equilibrium in the matrix or the fundamental ones of a point force. The study focuses on an incompressible matrix and offers a full solution for an isotropic matrix.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
