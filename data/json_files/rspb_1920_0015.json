They found that the assimilatory power of young leaves depends more on the age of the leaf than its color. The assimilation increases with time after greening, even when kept in the dark, suggesting that factors other than chlorophyll content, leaf area, or respiration are responsible for this increase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
