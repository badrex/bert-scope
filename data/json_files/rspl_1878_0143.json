They observed that when one or both commissures were divided, the crayfish's movements and abilities were significantly impaired, demonstrating the importance of the nervous system's organization and connections in coordinating and controlling the animal's actions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
