The author explains that heterosis can be due to the presence of multiple alleles at a single locus, which can be advantageous in certain conditions. Heterosis can also be influenced by the closeness of linkage between genes and the incorporation of recessive lethal mutants. The author suggests that while some polymorphisms are stabilized by heterosis, it is always worth considering other stabilizing factors, such as Darwinian natural selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
