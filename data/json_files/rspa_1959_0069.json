They investigated the fading characteristics of the echoes and found that the main cause of fading was the rotation of the satellite. The authors also discovered that the satellite's effective scattering area varied between 10 and 500 square meters, suggesting that it was a long object with a re-radiation polar diagram having one major and many minor lobes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Satellite Technology"}
