The authors found that the reaction rates are faster in solvents with higher cohesion, and the observed critical increments are significantly lower than the calculated values. This suggests that the reaction mechanism may involve ionization of one of the reagents as a precursor, and the observed critical increments may involve the heats of ionization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
