They test the model using specific volume measurements, relative viscosity measurements, and heat of solution data, providing support for the model's predictions. The model suggests that water clusters in these solution systems correspond to the gel point in polyfunctional polymerization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
