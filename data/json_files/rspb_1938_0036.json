They discovered that the electrical oscillations in these animals' ears contribute to the response recorded from the auditory nerve. The results provide insights into the cochlear potentials and the mechanism of sensory endings in the vertebrate auditory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
