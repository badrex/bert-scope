It explains how the organism moves using the coordinated undulations of thousands of spirochaetes covering its body surface, rather than its four flagella. The article also discusses the close association of Mixotricha with at least three distinct kinds of micro-organisms, which are integrated into its structure and behavior in a unique way.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology"}
