They explore the role of metal chelation in the action of antibiotics, such as oxine, and its impact on bacterial growth. The study suggests that some metals, like cobalt, may have essential functions in certain organisms, while others, like iron, can cause toxicity when present in excess.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
