{"article_id": "110535", "revised_title": "Accounting for the Discrepancy between Actual and Theoretical Sound Velocity", "semantic_tags": ["Acoustics", "Fluid dynamics", "Gas dynamics", "Sound velocity", "Newton's theory"], "tldr": "The author, William Ritchie, investigates the discrepancy between the actual velocity of sound in air or vapor and the velocity predicted by theory. He criticizes previous hypotheses by Newton and Laplace and presents his own experimental findings using tuning forks, organ pipes, hydrogen gas, and carbonic acid gas. Ritchie's theory agrees with observations and provides a method to determine a liquid's density given its vapor's sound velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
