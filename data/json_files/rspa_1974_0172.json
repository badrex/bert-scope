They find that only vacuum space-times with algebraic type {22} allow for a complete determination of first-order perturbations. The study focuses on the subclass of type {22} space-times, including Kerr black holes, where the decoupled perturbation equations can be solved by separation of variables.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
