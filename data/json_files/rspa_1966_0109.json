They found that the quantum yield of nitrogen and hydrogen depends on the acidity and concentration of the solution. The results suggest that there is a second primary photochemical act occurring concurrently with the first, which results in the formation of a hydrogen atom directly. This second process has a quantum yield less than that of the first process but occurs more frequently at higher ratios.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
