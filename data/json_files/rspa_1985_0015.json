They develop comprehensive and generalized film thickness expressions that can predict minimum and central film thickness for any entrainment angle, providing a basis for analyzing and designing various machine elements operating in the elastohydrodynamic regime of lubrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
