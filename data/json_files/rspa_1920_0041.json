They introduce the concept of completely symmetrisable functions and discuss their properties, including expansion theorems and convergence. The results are applicable to a broader class of functions, extending the well-known expansion theorems for symmetric functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
