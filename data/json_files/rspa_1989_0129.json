The authors derive asymptotic formulae for these effective dielectric constants by treating the influence of nearest-neighbor inclusions analytically. The results obtained are in agreement with other methods and provide additional terms not previously given. The analysis is performed using functional equations, which allow for the determination of charge distributions and fields analytically.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
