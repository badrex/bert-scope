The authors use the variation method to determine the parameters in potential functions representing the interaction energies. They find that repulsive forces between like particles are necessary for ranges of interaction less than 10^-13 cm, and that like-particle attractions become more significant for larger ranges of interaction. The study provides insights into the nature and magnitude of nuclear forces and contributes to a better understanding of nuclear structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
