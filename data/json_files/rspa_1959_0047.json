They found that the molecular weights determined by light scattering did not agree with those from sedimentation and viscosity data. The study suggests that real changes in molecular weight may occur due to radiation, which have not been discovered by the light-scattering method as employed in this research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
