It shows that both male and female guppies increase their schooling behavior when faced with a predator. However, females are more likely to inspect the predator, and in response, males increase their sneaky mating attempts while reducing their display behavior. The findings highlight the complex interplay between mating and predation risk in guppies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
