Rubisco catalyzes the oxygenation of ribulose bisphosphate, leading to the production of glycolate, which is then metabolized, releasing carbon dioxide and using energy. The article explores the relationship between photorespiration, oxygen inhibition of photosynthesis, and the carbon dioxide compensation point, and how it affects the overall process of photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
