They described the morphological characteristics of bipolar, ganglion, and amacrine cells in the inner plexiform layer and identified seven synaptic relationships. The study provides a model of the retina based on its anatomy and correlates it with ganglion cell physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
