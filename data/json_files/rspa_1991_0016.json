They decouple the equations governing the metric of the space-time from the equations governing the hydrodynamical variables, reducing the problem to one in scattering theory. This approach provides a deeper understanding of the physical consequences of general relativity and offers a simpler set of equations for evaluating the complex frequencies of the quasi-normal modes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
