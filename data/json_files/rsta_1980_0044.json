It addresses two main problems: detecting outliers in observations and testing coordinates in satellite networks. The authors develop confidence regions for both \"out of context\" and \"within context\" varieties and demonstrate that the latter confidence regions are generally larger than the former. They also explore the implications of these developments for Doppler satellite positioning.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
