This approach resolves the conflict between absolute and relative motion and can lead to Newtonian or Lorentzian dynamics for isolated subsystems. Intrinsic dynamics is closely related to gauge theory and has the same structure as Einstein's general theory of relativity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity and Gravitation"}
