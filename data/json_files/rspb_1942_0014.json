The starling is found to be the only common bird species closely associated with cattle, and its migration patterns and distribution show striking correlations with the incidence of the disease. The author suggests that starlings may act as carriers of the disease, transmitting it through mechanical means such as contaminated feet or feathers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
