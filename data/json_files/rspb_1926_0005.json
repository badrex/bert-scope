The research focuses on a type of exercise involving only the arms and shoulders, using a simple ergometer. The results show that even a small fraction of the total musculature can cause severe general fatigue. The oxygen intake rises much more slowly to its maximum value than in exercises involving most of the body's muscles, and a large oxygen debt may be incurred if the exercise is prolonged.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Exercise Physiology"}
