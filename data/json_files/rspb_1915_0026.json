They used a special condenser system and a thermopile to measure the energy falling on the eye structures. The results showed that the absorption bands of the eye media were similar to those of water, indicating that no considerable difference exists between the absorption bands of the eye media and those of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
