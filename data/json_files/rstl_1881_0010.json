They found that the heat transfer in water occurs through conduction and convection, and the heat equation can be used to calculate the thermal conductivity. The experiments showed that water's thermal conductivity remains relatively constant over a range of temperatures and is an essential property for understanding heat transfer in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
