They analyze the equations of motion and conclude that the hypothesis of small pressure variations compared to the undisturbed pressure is incorrect. The study provides insights into understanding atmospheric oscillations and temperature variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
