The seeds showed a high degree of lipid preservation, with fatty acid and sterol profiles similar to modern radish seeds. Deoxyribonucleosides and nucleic acid bases were also detected, and polymerase chain reactions yielded sequences comparable to modern radish. The results demonstrate the potential of combined lipid-nucleic acid analysis in identifying and studying ancient plant remains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Archaeobotany"}
