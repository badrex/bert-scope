He found that the luminous belt of the Aurora Borealis is at a constant height above the Earth's surface and is related to the Earth's magnetic meridian. Farquharson's observations led to a better understanding of the phenomenon and its connection to Earth's geomagnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
