The least attractive force allows the most refrangible rays to escape first, resulting in a blue flame. As the heat increases, more rays are released, eventually creating a white flame. This phenomenon can be observed in various combustible materials and helps explain the colors and behavior of flames during combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and combustion"}
