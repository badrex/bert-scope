Tanaka and Prof. O. W. Richardson, conducted experiments to measure the accurate wave-lengths of additional lines in the many-lined spectrum of hydrogen. They found many weak lines not recorded in any published tables and discussed the possible contaminants and their effects on the spectrum. The authors used a hydrogen flame fed by a strong current of oxygen and remeasured the lines of water-vapor bands and sodium D lines for better accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
