They found that plant growth was promoted by the supplied nitrogen, but nodule growth and nitrogen fixation per plant were depressed. The study provides insights into the role of nitrate-nitrogen in nodule symbioses and its implications for the biosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
