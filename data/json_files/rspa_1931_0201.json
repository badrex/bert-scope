They discover that the dihydantoin's optical activity persists through various reactions and that the compound's resolution can be achieved using the alkaloid brucine. The authors also investigate the crystal structures and densities of the dihydantoin and its isomerides, finding abnormally high densities and discussing the connection between density, solubility, and melting point in these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Stereochemistry"}
