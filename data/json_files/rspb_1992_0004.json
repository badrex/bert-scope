They found that the on-bipolar cell channel was blocked by L-m-diltiazem, a block that was strongly voltage-dependent. However, the on-bipolar cell channel was not identical to the photoreceptor channel. The study also showed that the conductance of the on-bipolar cell channels was unaffected by the removal of external divalent cations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
