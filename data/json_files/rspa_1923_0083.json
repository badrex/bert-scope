He explains that the structure of conducting salts is the determining factor in their behavior, and provides a detailed analysis of the electrolytic conduction of silver and lead haloids. The author also explores the role of primary active units in these compounds and the influence of salts and non-electrolytes on conductivity in aqueous solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
