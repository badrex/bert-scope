The octopuses showed a tendency to attack moving figures, with crabs being the most attractive. The vertical lobe removal affected the animals' responses, changing their previous tendencies to attack. The results suggest that the vertical lobe is involved in setting up memories that determine an animal's response to a figure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
