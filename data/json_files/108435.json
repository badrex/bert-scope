The author finds that the curve of high water heights is nearly the same at all these places, and that the equilibrium theory accurately predicts the form of the curve. The author also notes that the ratio of lunar to solar tides varies depending on the location and the size of the tide, and that the mean water level is generally lower than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
