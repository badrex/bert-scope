They employ a more complete Hamiltonian and develop new methods for evaluating matrix elements, which are then applied to several small molecules and radicals. The results show good agreement with experimental data and provide a basis for semi-empirical procedures that can be applied to larger molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Chemistry"}
