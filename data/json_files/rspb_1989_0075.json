The results show that antigenic sites are abundant in the central neuropile of the ganglion, with fewer sites detected in the peripheral regions. The findings suggest that the antibody staining pattern may be a better representation of nicotinic receptor distribution than the pattern of 125I-labelled a-bungarotoxin binding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
