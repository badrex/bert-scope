This lobe, which resembles Cowper's gland, is connected to the vasa deferentia and can cause swelling and enlargement, leading to difficulties in passing urine. The discovery of this lobe helps explain the nature of certain diseases and their effects on the urinary system.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Urology"}
