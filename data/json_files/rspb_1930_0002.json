They find that amoeboid movement can continue even when oxygen is completely absent and the external medium has a high reducing power. The study also shows that amoeboid movement is remarkably independent of changes in the internal and external reduction intensity. The results suggest that amoebas may derive energy for locomotion from an anaerobic reaction rather than oxidative processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
