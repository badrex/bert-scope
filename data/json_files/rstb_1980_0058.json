The researchers found that the motional state of serotonin in platelet granules is restricted due to high molecular weight aggregates formed by adenine nucleotides and metal ions. This restriction varies depending on the species of the platelets. The study also observed that in human platelet granules, these high molecular weight aggregates are present in the absence as well as in the presence of serotonin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
