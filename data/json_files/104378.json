The perihelion of the orbit was within the sphere of Venus's orbit and outside Mercury's orbit. The plane of the orbit was inclined at an angle of 53 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic. Zanotti's calculations were based on Dr. Halley's elements of cometical astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
