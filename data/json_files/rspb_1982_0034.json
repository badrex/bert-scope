They discovered a densely packed population of protrusions about 8.5 nm in diameter, which are mainly confined to the postsynaptic regions of the sarcolemma and are likely the acetylcholine receptor molecules. The protrusions are generally tightly packed without an obvious regular arrangement, but in some areas, they form irregular rows perpendicular to the fold's axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
