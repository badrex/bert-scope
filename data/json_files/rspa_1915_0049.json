They find that the stress is not uniformly distributed and is greatest on the surface where the force is applied. The study provides a method to calculate the maximum stress on the screwed part of the cylinder, which is essential for designing safe and efficient pressure vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
