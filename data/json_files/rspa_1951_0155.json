The crystal structure of this new phase contains eight distorted and expanded body-centered tetragonal units of the original martensite structure. The iron atoms are displaced due to the presence of nitrogen atoms occupying one twenty-fourth of the number of octahedral interstices in a completely ordered manner. This discovery sheds light on the tempering mechanisms of iron-nitrogen systems and the formation of new types of disorder-order changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Formation and Properties"}
