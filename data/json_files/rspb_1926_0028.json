They found that adding pituitary extract to the blood inhibited polyuria and increased the chloride output in the urine. This suggests that the pituitary gland may play a role in regulating kidney function and that pituitrin-like substances could be involved in controlling water and salt balance in the body.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
