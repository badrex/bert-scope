The authors combine epidemiological and demographic data within a mathematical model to show that gonorrhea significantly affects fertility and net population growth in areas with high prevalence of untreated infections. The model's predictions align with observed data from Uganda and suggest that effective sexually transmitted disease control programs can help combat the spread of HIV and improve fertility rates in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
