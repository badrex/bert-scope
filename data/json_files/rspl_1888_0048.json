The authors describe experiments that demonstrate the normal ventricular variation in electrical activity and how it is affected by the position of the heart and electrodes. The findings provide insights into the electrical effects of the heart and contribute to the understanding of heart function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
