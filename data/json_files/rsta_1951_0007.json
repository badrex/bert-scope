They found that the large-scale structure of the turbulence was similar across different grid geometries, but the largest eddies were significantly anisotropic. The energy spectrum function was self-preserving within the initial period of decay, with a shape independent of the grid's shape. The part of the spectrum that was not self-preserving contained at least one-third of the total energy, leading the authors to caution theories postulating quasi-equilibrium during decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
