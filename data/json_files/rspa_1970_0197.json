They tested the methods of selective absorption and selective chopping in the real atmosphere, providing valuable experience and data for the remote measurement of atmospheric temperature using satellite radiometers. The experiment aimed to obtain accurate weighting functions to interpret the results and improve the understanding of atmospheric temperature from satellites.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
