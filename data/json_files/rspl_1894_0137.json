The authors conducted experiments to show that carbon dioxide enters and exits the leaf through stomata, while cuticular exchange plays a minimal role. This finding is important for understanding how plants absorb carbon dioxide for photosynthesis and release waste gases like carbon dioxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
