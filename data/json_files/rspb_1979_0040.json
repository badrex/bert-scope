The authors confirm that Julesz random-dot stereo pairs lose their depth when presented with equal brightness backgrounds and dots. They develop a new technique for creating isoluminant pictures with exact registration for any two colors, and find that large displacements of borders occur when shifted across isoluminance. These findings suggest that stereo depth is a perceptual hypothesis, not solely derived from retinal disparity signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
