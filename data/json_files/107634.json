He discovered that several stars appeared to have changed their positions since 1812, with a general tendency for stars to appear south of their predicted places. This study aimed to understand the cause of these deviations and refine the accuracy of star positions in catalogs.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
