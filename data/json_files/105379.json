The meteor was round, about the size of Venus, with a light bluish cast. It moved quickly from north to south and vanished at a height of 4 to 5 degrees above the horizon. After its disappearance, several bright particles and a faint light, like a comet's tail, were seen. This observation provides valuable information about the appearance and behavior of meteors during that time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
