It explores the use of statistical analysis and fracture mechanics to assess the reliability of structures and components, taking into account factors such as material properties, environmental conditions, and inspection methods. The authors emphasize the need for a probabilistic approach to account for uncertainties and variations in design parameters, and highlight the role of risk assessment in making informed decisions about structural integrity and safety.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Risk Assessment and Management"}
