They construct a mathematical model to describe cavity widening and compare it with observed kinetics. The study reveals that the rate of cavity widening is determined by the chemical composition of the S2 layer of the secondary wood cell wall, and cavity elaboration occurs at the cylindrical surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil and Wood Science"}
