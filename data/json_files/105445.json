He explains how the instrument can be used to take precise measurements and improve the accuracy of observations, even in the challenging conditions of a moving vessel. Michell also suggests using the quadrant in conjunction with charts and geometric principles to determine a ship's location with great precision.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
