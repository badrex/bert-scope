The research focuses on the forces experienced by planing hulls at various speeds, including pressure resistance, skin friction, and the hump speed, which is the speed at which resistance is at its maximum. The findings provide insights into the behavior of boats and planing hulls in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
