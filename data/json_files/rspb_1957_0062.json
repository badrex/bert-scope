The authors explain that freezing causes changes in the physical environment, such as increased ionic strength and pH changes, which can damage lipid-protein complexes. They provide examples of how different lipid-protein complexes respond to freezing and suggest that the removal of water during freezing may be a significant factor in the damage caused to these complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
