It shows that high-density zooxanthellae populations can supply a significant portion of the animal's respiratory carbon demand, while low-density populations do not have excess organic carbon available for host respiration. This demonstrates that the metabolic relationship between zooxanthellae and their invertebrate hosts can change during the establishment of a symbiotic association.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
