They highlight the importance of understanding the complexity of cellular interactions and the development of clonal analysis techniques to study immunoregulation and tolerance. The author also touches upon the role of anti-idiotypic networks and the potential for hierarchies of suppressor cells in immune responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
