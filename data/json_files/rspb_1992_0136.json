The results show that both GABA and glycine currents exhibit outward rectification and partial desensitization. The study also reveals similarities between GABA- and glycine-activated currents, suggesting that both agonists activate comparable numbers of anatomically distinct channels with very similar permeation properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
