They explain how substances are classified based on their ability to diffuse through the membrane and how this can help explain selective processes. The author also explores the role of hydration and hydrolation in the behavior of substances and their interaction with membranes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
