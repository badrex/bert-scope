At low temperatures, the absorption at this center can be bleached to less than 10% of its original strength, and the absorption may be restored by warming the sample to room temperature. The temperature dependence of the thermal recovery process and the intensities of the 2.367 and 1.979 zero phonon lines were investigated, revealing that both zero phonon lines are due to transitions from split ground states. The 2.367 center is believed to be a substitutional nitrogen-interstitial complex involving at least two interstitials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
