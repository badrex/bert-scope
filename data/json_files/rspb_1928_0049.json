They find that wool fibers experience no permanent alteration below 34% extension, and beyond this point, the degree of elastic imperfection increases with the extension attained. The study also reveals that wool fibers consist of an elastic continuous cellular framework enclosing a fibrillar structure arranged along the fiber's axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Materials Science"}
