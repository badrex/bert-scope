They found that the resistance per unit area of the surface, density, velocity, and other factors affect the similarity of motion. The experiments confirmed the index law of fluid resistance and provided insights into the variation of the ratio of mean velocity to maximum velocity in pipes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
