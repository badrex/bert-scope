Infrared observations show that some bright craters have more consolidated material at or near the surface and rougher terrain on a small scale. This suggests that the process of modification on the lunar surface reduces visible reflectivity, smooths, and insulates the surface materials. The non-uniform distribution of infrared anomalies implies that some areas preferentially produce or expose material with lower thermal inertia, while others remove or cover it. This may be due to differences in the host rocks or varying covering processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Lunar Geology"}
