They used a steel ionization chamber with high pressure to measure the weak radiations produced by scattered gamma rays. The results showed that not more than a third of the difference in absorption coefficients of thorium-rays in heavy and light elements can be attributed to nuclear absorption resulting in the re-emission of approximately isotropic radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
