The research shows that the shortening at high rates is due to incomplete recovery of the plateau currents, while at low rates, it is related to declines in the maximum diastolic potential and the pacemaker potential. The findings suggest that the shortening of the action potential at low rates may be caused by a decline in the second inward current, which depends on a decline in intracellular sodium concentration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
