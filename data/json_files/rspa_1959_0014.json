They found that silicon tetrafluoride accelerates the decomposition, while acetone and hexane have no effect. The results suggest that the effectiveness of foreign gases is related to their ability to release fluorine or chlorine atoms, which may initiate a chain reaction or alter the reaction mechanism. The authors also observed changes in the product ratios, such as an increase in methane formation in the presence of certain gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and catalysis"}
