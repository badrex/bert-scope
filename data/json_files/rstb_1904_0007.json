They discuss the concept of antithetic alternation, where the sporophyte generation arises from the fertilized ovum and has a distinct phylogenetic history. The author also explores the role of sterilization in the evolution of plants and the methods of morphological change.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
