The process involves neutralizing the solution with carbonate of ammonium, allowing the iron to precipitate while other metals remain in solution. This method is useful for analytical inquiries and has practical applications in chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
