The authors use pulse radiolysis to study the reactions between these radicals and various solutes, such as chloride, bromide, iodide, thiocyanate, carbonate, nitrate, and formate ions. They find that methoxy radicals react with solutes in methanol and ethanol, and that the yield of scavengable methoxy radicals depends on the concentration of the solutes. The authors also study the effect of formate ion on the yield of methoxy radicals and find that the reaction between methoxy radicals and formate ion is slow.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiation Chemistry"}
