They find that surface compliance significantly reduces the intensity of the sound generated at the edge at very low frequencies. Additionally, the efficient generation of extensional waves by an edge flow at low frequencies has a profound effect on the production of sound, with the dominant component of the scattered sound radiating within a narrow range of directions determined by the leaky waves excited at the nozzle exit.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aeroacoustics"}
