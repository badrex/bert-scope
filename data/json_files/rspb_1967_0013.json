They found that the frequency of nerve impulses is related to the steady voltage produced by the stimulus if regenerative activity is blocked. The results were compared with simplified models and the experimental literature, suggesting that further mechanisms might be needed to explain the adaptation, variability, and wide range of steady frequencies displayed by some nerve cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
