The study focuses on the implications of different orderings of stiffnesses in orthorhombic elastic media and the resulting slowness sections. The article provides a detailed account of the possible degeneracies and their properties, such as conical and tangential double points, and discusses the phenomenon of internal conical refraction of elastic waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Elasticity"}
