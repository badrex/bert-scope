By studying these leaves, the author aims to gain insights into the climate and conditions of the Coal Measure period, as well as the development of plant structures. The research adds to the understanding of the biology and ecology of fossil plants and contributes to the broader field of paleobotany.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
