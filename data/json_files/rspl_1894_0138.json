Norman Lockyer, studied the photographic spectrum of the star y-Cassiopeiae and discovered various bright and dark lines in its spectrum. The bright lines were found to be from hydrogen, while the dark lines were similar to those seen in the spectra of other stars. The study provided insights into the star's properties and helped to understand the nature of its spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
