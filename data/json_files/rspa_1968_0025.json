Further adsorption of water with the evolution of hydrogen occurs at higher temperatures. The interaction of water with tungsten leads to oxidation of the metal with the formation of hydrogen at 300\u00b0C. The study provides insights into the nature of the catalytically active surface of treated tungsten.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
