The authors observed changes in phosphocreatine, ATP, inorganic phosphate, and other biochemical intermediates during muscle contraction and recovery. They also studied the control of glycolysis and the relationship between muscle force development, relaxation, and substrate levels. NMR provided valuable insights into muscle fatigue and the underlying biochemical processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
