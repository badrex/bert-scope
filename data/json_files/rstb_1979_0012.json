The authors discuss the consequences of these changes on the land biota of Aldabra, particularly for the giant tortoises, and provide evidence for climatic change on the atoll. The findings highlight the importance of understanding long-term climatic changes for the development of terrestrial ecosystems in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climatology"}
