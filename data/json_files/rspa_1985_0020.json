The author constructs a uniformly valid solution using matched asymptotic expansions, consisting of an inner solution field represented by a nonlinear, inviscid Stuart vortex and an outer solution field represented by a viscous flow. The study provides a framework for understanding the dynamics of vortical structures in complex flows and helps in setting consistent boundary and initial conditions for numerical fluid dynamic calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
