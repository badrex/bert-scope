They found that yielding the metal reduces the activation polarization required for dissolution, assisting the process and potentially explaining the propagation of stress-corrosion cracks in certain types of steel. This phenomenon has not been observed in other metals, such as nickel, titanium, or mild steel, which do not suffer stress-corrosion cracking under similar conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
