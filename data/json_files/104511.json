The device, known as the Weaver's Larum, consists of a candle, a piece of thread, a graduated board, and a weight. When the candle burns through the thread at the desired time, the weight falls, creating a noise to wake the user. This invention serves as an example of how necessity can lead to innovation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Invention and DIY"}
