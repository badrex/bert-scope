They discovered that some metals, like potassium, exhibit an increase in resistance when exposed to electric waves, while others, like magnesium, show a decrease in resistance. They also found that a self-recovering coherer can be made by using metals less prone to oxidation and adjusting the pressure and E.M.F. to control the response.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
