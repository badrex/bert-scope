They found that the visual system can effectively summate energy from moving images, improving visibility and motion perception. This ability is essential for detecting and recognizing low-contrast targets in motion, which is crucial for survival. The study also revealed that the visual system achieves this by using a process called resonance of temporally tuned filters.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
