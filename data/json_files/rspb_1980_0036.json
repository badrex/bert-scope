They also analyzed the protein's phospholipase A2 activity and its effects on natural membranes with low cholesterol content. The study provides evidence that their purified (3-bungarotoxin preparation is free from contaminants and is suitable for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
