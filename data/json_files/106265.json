He explains that Gorgonia, also known as sea-fans, sea-feathers, and sea-whips, are animals of the polyp kind, resembling the common freshwater polyp. They grow by spreading over substances that serve as their base and repairing any damage through the use of longitudinal tubes. This discovery helps clarify the classification of Gorgonia within the animal kingdom."}
