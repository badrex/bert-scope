They model this mechanism and perform experiments on rat liver microsomes to test its consistency with published data. The model can simulate quantal release, where InsP3 causes a rapid initial release of calcium from a store, followed by a slower one-way flux at a steady state. The model provides a possible explanation for various experimental results related to calcium release and signaling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
