It explores the different mechanisms that governed the development of these basins, including crustal extension, wrench-induced pull-apart features, and compression. The article also highlights the role of tensional and compressional tectonics in the formation of these basins and the impact of orogenic cycles on their development.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
