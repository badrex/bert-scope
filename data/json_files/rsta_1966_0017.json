The authors describe the design and operation of their apparatus, which combines a time-of-drift electrode system and a lateral diffusion system. They measure the drift velocity of ions and discuss the limitations of their method. The findings contribute to the understanding of ion mobility and gas physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ion mobility and gas physics"}
