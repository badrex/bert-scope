The meeting aimed to review the qualitative understandings of diagenesis and identify areas where further research is needed. Topics covered include the effects of climate change on sedimentary input, microbial processes, and the role of diagenetic concretions in the sedimentary record.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
