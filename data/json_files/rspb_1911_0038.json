They found that when the oxygen supply is insufficient, the lung epithelium actively secretes oxygen inwards. This occurs during muscular work and when breathing air with low oxygen levels. These findings are important for understanding the physiology of mountain climbing, balloon ascents, and ordinary muscular work.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
