They found that mealworms lose weight at different rates in air with varying relative humidities, but maintain a constant ratio of dry matter to water in their bodies. The study provides insights into the relationship between environmental factors and insect metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
