They investigated the -ray emission anisotropy from the long-lived isomer and determined the nuclear magnetic moment. The results confirmed the antiferromagnetic ordering and were consistent with the predictions of Bleaney based on an effective field treatment of the dipole-dipole interaction between the enhanced nuclear moments. The spin-flop phase was identified in fields of order T.1.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
