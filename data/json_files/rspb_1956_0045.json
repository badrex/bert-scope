They find that clutch sizes are generally adapted to correspond with the number of young that can be successfully raised. The authors also explore the concept of ecotypes and how they relate to habitat and environmental gradients. They suggest that ecotypic differentiation is more pronounced in isolated habitats, but can also occur in populations occupying habitats with contrasting environments. The maintenance of genotype heterogeneity and the avoidance of ecotypic plant-size specialization depend on the ability of competing genotypes to assume phenotypic expressions that deviate from the prevailing habitat environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
