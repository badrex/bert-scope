They used a simple model that included anharmonicity and compared their results with experimental data. The study showed that anharmonic interactions affect the temperature dependence of the elastic constants and the Gruneisen parameters, which are essential for understanding the lattice dynamics of crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
