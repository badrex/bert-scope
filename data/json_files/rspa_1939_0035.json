The authors explore the role of direct electron recombination and the cross-section for continuous absorption of radiation by oxygen atoms, which can be useful in understanding the formation of ionized layers by solar radiation and in astrophysics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
