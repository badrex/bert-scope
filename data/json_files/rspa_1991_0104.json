They find that for stars with radii in the range of 2.25 to 2.50, quasinormal axial modes of oscillation are possible. The study demonstrates the existence of these modes as a further example of what is possible within the framework of general relativity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativistic Astrophysics"}
