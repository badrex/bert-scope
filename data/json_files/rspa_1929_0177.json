The author develops a theory based on probability and collision dynamics, which allows for the calculation of the straggling effect and the most probable loss of energy. The study focuses on the experimental results of White and Millingon, comparing their findings with the classical theory of Bohr.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
