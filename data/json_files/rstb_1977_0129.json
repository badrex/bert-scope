It explains how mechanical fractionation can separate valuable crop components from useless or deleterious companions, enabling better utilization of resources. The author highlights various methods of fractionation, including field fractionation, dry fractionation, and fresh forage fractionation, and their potential benefits in terms of protein extraction, energy conservation, and waste reduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Crop Management"}
