The author found that thermal expansion coefficients and specific heat ratios change with temperature, and that the critical temperature for steel varies depending on its carbon content. The elastic rigidity and viscosity of metals also change with temperature, but these changes do not coincide with the change of state.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
