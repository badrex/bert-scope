They apply this theorem to the problem of lattice vibrations and demonstrate its effectiveness in finding the eigenvalue distribution of matrices related to these systems. The method offers a direct and efficient way to compute frequency spectra for two-dimensional lattices, overcoming some limitations of previous techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra"}
