The study investigates the dependence of the structure on three parameters: type of acoustic source, tip Mach number, and harmonic number. The results reveal the boundary between near-field and far-field structure, which is well-defined and occupies the surface of a sphere or ellipsoid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
