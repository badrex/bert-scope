The model assumes that the shale behaves as an imperfect ion-exclusion membrane and uses the concept of reflection and transmission coefficients to predict the time-dependent flow of a compressible fluid through the shale. The analysis provides insights into the swelling of shales and the stresses and strains around a swelling wellbore during oil drilling.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Geophysics"}
