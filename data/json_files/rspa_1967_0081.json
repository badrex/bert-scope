The authors propose a new approach using boundary layer approximations to analyze the effects of surface films and capillary hysteresis on wave damping. The results are compared with previous experimental observations, suggesting that both surface films and capillary hysteresis contribute to the discrepancies in observed damping rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
