It discusses the evidence supporting the hypothesis that carcinogenesis is a multi-stage process involving initiation and promotion phases. The author proposes a new model based on somatic mutations in nuclear genes and analyzes the effect of population heterogeneity on mortality statistics. The theory considers the role of genetic predisposition and inheritance factors in carcinogenesis and provides insights into cancer incidence rates and age dependencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
