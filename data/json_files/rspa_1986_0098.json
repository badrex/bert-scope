The study considers the growth rate to be subcritical and provides a mathematical formulation and exact solution for the displacement field caused by the distribution growth. The findings can be applied to the analysis of plastic flow and dynamic crack extension in crystalline solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
