They classify all solutions into six 'genera' and use analytical methods to enumerate all possible solutions. This method also provides the first analytical proof that 12 and only 12 patterns formed by linking complementary numbers within a square are necessary and sufficient to describe all solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics"}
