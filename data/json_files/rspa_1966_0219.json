This extended theorem is particularly useful for semi-empirical theories of molecular rate processes and can lead to variationally stable results. The formalism is applicable to Hamiltonians with discrete, continuous, or mixed spectra and can be used to calculate stationary and dynamic information based on matrix elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
