It reviews the levels of various pesticides in the sea and the concentration found at different trophic levels in the marine food chain. The article highlights the persistence of these chemicals in the environment and their potential harm to marine life and ecosystems. It also examines the routes of entry for these pesticides into the marine environment and their concentrations in various sources such as air, rivers, and sewage.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Pollution and Contamination"}
