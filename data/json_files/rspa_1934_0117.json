The authors discovered that certain alloys with an aluminum content of over 12% exhibit peculiarities in these properties, which they attribute to a phase transformation. They also found that heat treatment can modify the properties of these alloys, with the effect being most pronounced between 13% and 14% aluminum content.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Properties"}
