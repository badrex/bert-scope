They assume that the dissipation integral is mainly determined by the inertial range form of the energy spectrum (Kolmogorov distribution) and that the response function can be approximated by its inertial range form only. The resulting equation yields the Kolmogorov distribution for the infinite Reynolds number limit and provides the general asymptotic form of the spectrum, which behaves like k^(-5/3) in the inertial range and decays exponentially in the viscous range of wave numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
