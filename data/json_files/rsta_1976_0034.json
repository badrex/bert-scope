X-ray telescope on Skylab. They discuss the role of active regions in the structure and evolution of the corona, focusing on the importance of magnetic fields in shaping coronal loops and the distribution of plasma. The authors also describe the large-scale loops and coronal holes, which are related to the magnetic fields of old active regions and serve as sources of high-velocity solar wind streams.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
