They found that the uterine glands secrete a nutritive fluid that is conveyed to the embryo through the trophonemata. Their observations on the development of the young fish and the structure of the uterus provide insights into the reproductive biology of these species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
