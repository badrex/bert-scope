The authors explore the anatomical distribution of afferents and their terminal arborizations, as well as the physiological receptive fields of cells in the spinal cord. They conclude that ineffective synapses offer an alternative explanation for the plasticity of connections in adult brains, and that these connections can be unmasked under conditions of optimal spatial summation, increased excitability, or decreased inhibition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
