It argues that the Society was productive and grew significantly during this period, with an increasing membership and substantial intellectual output. The author highlights the Society's focus on instrumental empiricism and mixed mathematics, as well as the diverse backgrounds of its fellows, who contributed to various scientific achievements and observations. The article also discusses the Society's role in promoting scientific communication and validating experimental results, as well as its relationship with the monarchy and the importance of social status within the organization."}
