They develop a model for a Gaussian height distribution and exponential autocorrelation function, which is used to study the distribution of asperities' heights and curvatures. This research has implications for understanding friction, wear, and other aspects of surfaces in contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
