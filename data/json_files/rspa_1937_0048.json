The authors analyze the chlorine spectrum using spectrographs and discuss the influence of different conditions on the production of bands and atomic lines. They also examine the effect of cooling the discharge tube and the role of isotopes in the spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
