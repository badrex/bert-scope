These surfaces can be used to predict plant assemblages under given climate conditions and to validate atmospheric general circulation model climate simulations. The technique involves fitting surfaces for each pollen taxon or species and combining them to provide a fitted pollen spectrum for each point in climate space. The climate associated with a fossil pollen spectrum is reconstructed by finding its closest analogue among the grid-point spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Palaeoclimatology"}
