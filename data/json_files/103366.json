The event occurred during a misty day without rain, and the cause remains uncertain. The area was known for lead and coal mining, but no eruptions had been reported in the area. The spout left a deep gulf, destroyed ten acres of land, and created several chasms that needed to be filled to prevent sheep from falling in.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
