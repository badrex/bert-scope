The research found that very young land habitats had significantly lower concentrations of antibiotic-resistant bacteria compared to older habitats, with vegetation playing a crucial role in the development of antibiotic resistance in soil microorganisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Microbiology"}
