The disagreement arose from conflicting interpretations of the reasons for the award, with some arguing that Darwin's groundbreaking work, \"On the Origin of Species,\" played a role in the decision, while others claimed it was excluded. The article examines the events leading up to the award, the Council's decision, and the subsequent debate over the significance of the omission of Darwin's work from the official announcement.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
