Researchers found high field strengths between 1 and 2 O during the main excursion, which occurred between 13,000 and 26,000 years ago. The findings provide insights into the Earth's core and the processes that occur during geomagnetic excursions and polarity transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
