It derives connections between the effective elastic, piezoelectric, and dielectric constants of two- and three-phase systems, as well as the effective thermal stress and pyroelectric coefficients. The study considers composites with transversely isotropic constituents and overall transverse isotropic behavior, providing a generalization of Hill's relations for the uncoupled mechanical behavior of two-phase fibrous composites.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
