They found that self-heating is always present and that the critical temperature rise for ignition is independent of dilution. The results support the conductive theory of thermal explosion, which predicts that temperature gradients at the vessel boundary should be the same in both cylinders and spheres.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
