They contaminated the drinking water of the goats with sterilized soil mixed with the feces of goitrous individuals. The results showed that 50% of the goats developed goitre, indicating that goitre could be transmitted through contaminated water. The study also found that earthworms were not involved in the spread of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology and Pathology"}
