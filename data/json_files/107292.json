He discovers that the nucleus of the comet is smaller and less bright than previously thought. He also examines the coma and tail of the comet, finding that the tail is longer on the south-preceding side and that the coma affects the brightness of nearby stars. This research contributes to our understanding of comets and their physical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Comets"}
