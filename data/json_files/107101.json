They explain the use of a complete circle with a horizon glass and an additional index, allowing for multiple observations to determine the distance between celestial objects. This method reduces errors and increases the instrument's accuracy, making it more useful for astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
