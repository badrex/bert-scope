It shows that Artemia can adapt to low oxygen levels by synthesizing more haemoglobin, with females producing more than males. The study also reveals that Artemia loses haemoglobin in well-aerated water and that the red colour of the shrimp is due to both haemoglobin and carotenoids. Furthermore, it demonstrates that Artemia's haemoglobin concentration increases with increasing salinity and decreasing dissolved oxygen content, resulting in a redder colour.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
