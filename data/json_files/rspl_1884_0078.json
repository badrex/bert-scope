They found that heating the glass vessels significantly reduced the amount of gas being carried down, and the gas collected was mainly composed of carbonic acid gas, oxygen, and nitrogen. The author also discussed the difference in opinions between physicists and geologists regarding the thickness of the Earth's crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
