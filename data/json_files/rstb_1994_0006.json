The authors develop a simple model that focuses on seasonal changes in predator and prey abundance, highlighting the importance of size as a determinant of survival in the sea and the life-history strategies that species must follow to thrive in these ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
