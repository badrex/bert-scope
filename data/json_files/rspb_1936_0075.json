They found that the growth cycle of Chlorella involves several stages, with variations in cell size and growth rates. The study provides a detailed description of the methods used to measure cell numbers, size, and growth rates, which can be applied to future research on algal growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Algae and Photosynthesis"}
