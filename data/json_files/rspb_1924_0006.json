They found that after ingesting phosphate, the inorganic phosphate in the blood increases by 50-60%, while the urinary output rises five times its normal value. The study also showed that the concentration of phosphorus in the urine is much higher than in the blood, and that the distribution of inorganic phosphate between plasma and corpuscles remains the same under normal conditions and after phosphate ingestion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
