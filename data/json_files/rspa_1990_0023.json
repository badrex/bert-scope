The near-field convergent expansion of the integral is achieved by reducing it to loop integrals and using recurrence relations for the involved polynomials and functions. This method provides a more efficient way to compute Kelvin wave source potentials for numerical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
