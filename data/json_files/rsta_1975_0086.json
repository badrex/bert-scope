They explore the use of seriation, a one-dimensional map-making technique, to arrange objects in chronological order based on the presence or absence of specific types of artifacts. The author also touches upon the use of similarity measures and scaling algorithms to improve the accuracy of these methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Archaeology"}
