The most intense lines are assigned to transitions, and their identifications are supported by Hartree-Fock energy calculations. Series due to simultaneous excitation of two electrons occur in the vicinity of the transitions, and intensity peculiarities suggest that these series arise through inter-subshell correlations. The quenching of the series is observed as the threshold for detachment of two electrons is approached.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Physics"}
