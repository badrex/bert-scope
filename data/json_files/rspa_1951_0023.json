It discusses how these electrons contribute to the electric dipole moment and influence the structure and physical properties of large aggregates of molecules in liquids. The authors also examine the factors that determine the associating power of lone-pair electrons in a given molecule, such as the electronic structure and the interactions between equivalent orbitals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry"}
