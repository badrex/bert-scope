The clock's escapement mechanism originated in China and was developed from mechanisms for the slow rotation of astronomical models. The author also discusses the influence of Chinese culture on the early Fellows of the Royal Society and the decision to invite Jesuit missionaries into China, which led to the unification of world science in Eastern Asia.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Horology"}
