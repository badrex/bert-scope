They find that large-amplitude vortices can drive the boundary layer and adjust the mean flow to make them locally neutral. The mean flow in the region of vortex activity has a'square-root' profile, and the vortex velocity field can be written down in closed form. The upper and lower boundaries of the region of vortex activity are determined by a free-boundary problem involving the boundary-layer equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
