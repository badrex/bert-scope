The authors derive an analytic formula for a one-dimensional return map, which allows them to provide a sufficient condition for chaos generation and analyze bifurcation phenomena. They also discover period-doubling bifurcation with symmetry breaking and verify some theoretical results through laboratory measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electronics and Circuits"}
