They argue that the Cavendish experiment provides the most accurate results, as it deals with known disturbing masses, while the other methods have significant errors due to unknown factors. The author also suggests improvements for future pendulum experiments to reduce errors.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
