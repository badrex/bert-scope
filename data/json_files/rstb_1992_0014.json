It proposes that familiar face recognition involves a fixed sequence of stages, including structural encoding, accessing long-standing visual representations, retrieving semantic information, and finally, retrieving the name. The article also examines factors that affect the ease of familiar face recognition, such as repetition priming, distinctiveness effects, and associative priming.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
