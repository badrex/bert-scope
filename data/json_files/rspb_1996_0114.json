The researchers cloned and sequenced the opsin cDNA, finding it highly homologous to the form of opsin expressed in deep-living European eels. The study provides evidence that specific amino acid sites are involved in the spectral tuning of blue-sensitive visual pigments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
