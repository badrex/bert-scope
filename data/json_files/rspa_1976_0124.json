They found that the energy difference between the 2BX planar and 2B2 perpendicular states of the radical-cation is about 67 kJ mol-1. The study also showed that the participation of the 2B2 state in a proposed 1,3-hydrogen shift lifts the orbital symmetry restriction predicted for this process in the case of the 2BX state. This research provides a better understanding of complex reaction systems in mass spectrometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy and Mass Spectrometry"}
