The authors analyze the divergences associated with the integral equation for the interaction and find that a single renormalization constant is needed, unlike in previous studies on scattering. They also discuss the renormalized vertex equation, meson self-energy, and the numerical evaluation of the phase shift.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
