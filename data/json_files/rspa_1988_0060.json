They investigate the interaction between lower-branch Tollmien-Schlichting waves and small-wavenumber Taylor-G\u00f6rtler vortices, which is important for understanding the transition process in external flows. The authors find that the interaction can lead to a finite-time singularity in the solution and a more complicated type of evolution equation, depending on the orientation of the wavefronts of the Tollmien-Schlichting waves to the G\u00f6rtler vortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
