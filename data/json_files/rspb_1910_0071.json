They found that Drosera plants do produce proteolytic enzymes, which break down proteins into peptones. The enzymes are not in the form of zymogens and do not extend the digestion process beyond peptones. The plants can absorb the peptone solution, but do not appear to have bacteria or other microorganisms involved in the digestive process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
