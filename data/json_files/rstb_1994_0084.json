It highlights the discrepancies among different data sets and emphasizes the importance of understanding the factors that influence these patterns, such as taxonomic revisions, sampling effects, and the choice of organs examined. The authors also explore the extent to which subordinate taxa provide independent observations of changes in biodiversity and suggest that further research is needed to improve the accuracy and completeness of existing data sets.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Biodiversity"}
