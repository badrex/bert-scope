They found that snake teeth do not have cementum, and the tooth-germs consist of a dentine-germ, enamel-organ, and a weak capsule. The tooth arrangement is peculiar and characteristic of Ophidia, with numerous successional teeth in a single section. The attachment of the teeth to the jaw is through a coarse bone that is not derived from the tooth-capsule.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
