This trypanosome has a unique morphology, with some forms having the nucleus at the posterior end. The authors also found that this strain is more virulent to rats and guinea-pigs than the old laboratory strain of T. gambiense and is resistant to atoxyl. The new trypanosome species was found in a patient who had never been in a Glossina palpalis area, raising questions about the transmission of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
