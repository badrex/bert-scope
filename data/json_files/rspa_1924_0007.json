They discovered two new sets of particles with definite ranges, which were emitted by the active deposits themselves rather than being produced by the passage of alpha-rays through matter. The experiments were also conducted in carbon dioxide to test if the main body of alpha-rays could produce long-range particles by disintegrating air molecules, but the results showed that the particles were emitted by the source.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
