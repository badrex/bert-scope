It explains how dislocations can be used to describe and calculate the elastic fields, energy, and displacement associated with these geological events. The article also outlines methods for finding the displacement field around a dislocation in a semi-infinite solid with free surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
