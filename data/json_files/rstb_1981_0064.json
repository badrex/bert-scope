The author presents transient and steady-state kinetic studies on the rabbit muscle enzyme, providing evidence for the Segal-Boyer pathway of catalysis. The article also reviews the enzyme's structure and the molecular basis of cooperativity, highlighting the importance of NAD+ binding in the enzyme's function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
