The authors describe the chemical structure of the Pr chromophore and the 15-isomer configuration of the Pfr chromophore. They also discuss the role of the apoprotein in phytochrome photoconversions and the differences in chromophore accessibility and reactivity between Pr and Pfr forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
