The results confirm that mare lavas were extruded in Mare Fecunditatis 3.4-3.5 Ga ago. The age of the Luna 20 metaclastic fragment provides further support for a 3.9 Ga age for the Crisium basin and the widespread cataclysmic bombardment of the moon between 4.05 and 3.85 Ga.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochronology"}
