It explores different types of metamorphism and how chemical reactions contribute to rock deformation. The author highlights the importance of considering time as a variable in understanding rock deformation and the impact of chemical processes on the mechanical properties of rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
