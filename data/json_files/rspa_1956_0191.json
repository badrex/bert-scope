They extend previous research to include the possibility of instability via a marginal state of purely oscillatory motions. The study shows that instability can occur as convection or as overstability, depending on the values of non-dimensional parameters and physical constants. Numerical results are provided for mercury at room temperature, and the nature of expected effects in experiments is illustrated.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
