The experiments reveal the formation of an axial cavitation cloud ahead of the jet, which collapses due to an entrapped air bubble. The jet-target interface shows periodic acceleration and deceleration, and the results have implications for various practical situations involving cavities and their collapse.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
