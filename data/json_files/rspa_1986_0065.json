The authors examine the effects of internal degrees of freedom excitation, deviations from the assumption of a perpendicular Mach stem, and the agreement between experimental and numerical transition boundaries. The findings improve the understanding of shock-wave reflections and contribute to the development of more accurate analytical predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
