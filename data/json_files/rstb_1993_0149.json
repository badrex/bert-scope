It explores the accumulation of storage proteins in plants, the activation of genes encoding these proteins, and the influence of factors such as sucrose, amino acids, and jasmonic acid on gene expression. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the regulation of storage protein genes for plant growth and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Genetics"}
