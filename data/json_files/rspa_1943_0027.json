They discuss the relaxation techniques and their applications, focusing on the physical interpretation of the problem using Prandtl's membrane analogy. The methods are applicable to various types of boundary conditions and can be used to find optimal solutions for engineering problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
