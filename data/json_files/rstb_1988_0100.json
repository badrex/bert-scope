It highlights the importance of understanding exposure and host susceptibility in the transmission and dynamics of these infections. The study finds that infection intensity is age-dependent, with children having higher infection rates and intensity than adults. The research also explores the role of exposure, such as geophagic behavior, and its impact on infection intensity. The findings suggest that a multidisciplinary approach is necessary for further understanding of the factors influencing infection intensity and transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
