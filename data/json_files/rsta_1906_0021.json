They found that these cells were reversible and influenced by the chemical composition of the system. The study of these cells led to the understanding that light creates an electromotive force (EMF) of polarization, which is a new phenomenon. This research contributes to the development of photovoltaic technologies and the understanding of light-induced reactions in electrochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
