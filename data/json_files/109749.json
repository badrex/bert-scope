He observed that tendrils move towards darkness and are attracted to dark objects. Tendrils of the Vine can return to a position when the light direction is changed, while those of the Virginia Creeper cannot. The organization of tendrils is similar to young succulent shoots, and their motion may be related to the movement of fluids within them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
