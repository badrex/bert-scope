The authors provide conditions on the coefficients that ensure the spectrum is discrete and necessary conditions for discreteness. These results extend the Molcanov criterion and have applications to higher-order weighted Sobolev spaces. The findings have implications for understanding the behavior of differential equations and their associated operators.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
