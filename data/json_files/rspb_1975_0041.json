This led to diminished acetylcholine sensitivity, reduced miniature end-plate potentials, and blockage of neuromuscular transmission. The results suggest that anti-ACh-receptor antibodies may be involved in neuromuscular diseases like myasthenia gravis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
