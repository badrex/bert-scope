They explain the deflection under shock loading conditions by combining the action of inertia and strain waves. The research compares the deflection of a disk to that of an extensible wire under similar conditions, suggesting a simple analogy for future analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
