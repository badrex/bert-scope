The authors explain that c-myc can act as a potent inducer of apoptosis, which occurs only in cells deprived of growth factors or forcibly arrested with cytostatic drugs. They also highlight the importance of the c-Myc's partner, Max, in controlling both mitogenic and apoptotic functions of c-Myc through a transcriptional mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
