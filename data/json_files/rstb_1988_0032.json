These limpets have unique feeding methods and anatomical features, such as specialized rhipidoglossate radula and a single left gill with a pectiniform skeleton. The study provides insights into the evolution and relationships of these limpets within the archaeogastropod level and their differences from other prosobranchs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
