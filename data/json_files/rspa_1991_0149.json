The study found that toluene concentration in methanol significantly affected flame luminosity and soot production. Burning rates and flame extinction were not significantly affected by toluene mixture fractions. The results provide insights into controlling flame luminosity and particulate formation by mixing alcohol and aromatic fuels, which can have implications for vehicle fuel and hazardous waste liquid management.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
