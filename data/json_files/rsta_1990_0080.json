The authors analyze the technical and economic progress of FBR systems, including investment costs, electricity generating costs, and fuel cycle costs. They also consider the competitiveness of FBRs with light water reactors (LWRs) and the impact of uranium price trends on the FBR market. The study provides a comprehensive overview of the current status and future prospects of FBR systems in France and Europe.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
