They used two instruments, a glass bottle and a glass cylinder, to measure the compression of air at different depths. The results were used to create a table showing the compression of air at various depths, which can be useful for divers and those using diving bells for recovery of lost items in water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
