The research challenges the hypothesis that handling by researchers led to stress-related reactivation of latent rabies viruses in wild dogs, which resulted in their deaths. The findings support the importance of continued monitoring and active management research programs for the survival of endangered wild dog populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
