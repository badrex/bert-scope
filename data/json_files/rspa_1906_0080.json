The researchers found that the rate of change in sugar solutions is influenced by the concentration of water and the presence of other substances. They discovered that metallic salts can accelerate the rate of sucroclastic action, while weak electrolytes like acetic acid have little effect. The findings suggest that understanding the influence of these substances can help determine the precise nature of enzyme action and hydrolytic change."}
