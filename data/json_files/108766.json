They determined the specific gravity by calculating the ratio of the sum of the volumes of the two metals to the volume of the alloy. The author found that some alloys expand while others contract, and the maximum expansion or contraction occurs when the alloy contains equal volumes of each metal. The study also discussed the brittleness and crystalline structure of gold-tin, gold-lead, and other alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
