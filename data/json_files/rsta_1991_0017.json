It discusses categories of excitation and relevant propeller-hull-wake parameters, and evaluates available elementary criteria and estimation formulas for making preliminary judgments on the acceptability of a given arrangement. The article also offers critiques of these criteria and their applicability to example ships, and their usefulness in implementing early-stage design for vibration avoidance.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Marine Engineering", "sub_discipline": "Ship Dynamics and Propeller Design"}
