They found that the depolarizing effect of chlorine gas was significant when the gas was allowed to bubble out and surround the carbon electrode, creating a more efficient cell. This research contributes to the understanding of electrochemical cells and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
