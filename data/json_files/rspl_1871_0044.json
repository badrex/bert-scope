Crace-Calvert conducted experiments to determine the effectiveness of various substances in preventing putrefaction and the development of protoplasmic and fungus-life. The study found that carbolic and cresylic acids were the most effective in preventing the development of both protoplasmic and fungus-life, while other substances like chloride of zinc and bichloride of mercury were effective in preventing the development of animalcules but not fungus-life. The results suggest that the effectiveness of antiseptics varies and that some substances may promote the growth of certain types of life while inhibiting others.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
