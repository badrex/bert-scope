De Luc's experiments reveal that the hair hygrometer is not an accurate measure of moisture and that the maximum of evaporation does not necessarily indicate extreme moisture. This discovery has implications for the understanding and application of hygrometry and the development of more accurate moisture-measuring instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrometeorology"}
