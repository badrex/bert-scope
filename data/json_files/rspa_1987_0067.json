The solution is expressed in terms of source terms and real integrals representing the diffracted field, and offers a new method for approximating wedges of any angle and evaluating the resulting integrals. This work expands upon previous methods, such as Sommerfeld's use of Riemann surfaces and periodic Green functions, and provides new insights into diffraction theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
