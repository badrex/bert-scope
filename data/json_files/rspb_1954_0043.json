They found that the complexity of glycosidic combinations is much greater than previously assumed, and the hypothesis of a high pelargonidin frequency among tropical plants was not confirmed. The study also showed a strong correlation between anthocyanidin types and flower colors, with cyanidin pigments producing a wide range of colors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
