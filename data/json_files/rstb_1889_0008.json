They found that descending degenerations occurred along the course of the pyramidal tract after removing or damaging these gyri. The results showed that the gyrus marginalis is part of the motor region of the brain, while the gyrus fornicatus is likely involved in sensory impressions.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain anatomy"}
