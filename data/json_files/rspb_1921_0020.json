The strength of the stimulus produced is the origin of color sensations. The evolutionary development of three primary color sensations (red, green, and blue) allows the human eye to interpret the frequencies of light reflected by natural objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Perception"}
