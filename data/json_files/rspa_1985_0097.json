The analysis considers the interaction between flaws and second-phase particles, and how stable cracks can form before final failure. The expected number of cracks at any stress level is calculated, and the statistical strength distribution for specimens under tension and bending is obtained.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Composite Materials"}
