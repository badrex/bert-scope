The study involved observations made by various surveying vessels and used the Admiralty Standard Compass and Kater's Azimuth Compass to determine the magnetic declination. The results were then compared to previous observations and showed an accelerating decrease in the westerly declination, with the annual change being greater on the eastern side of the United Kingdom.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
