They found that the probability of a vibrational transition is of the order of 10 per gas-kinetic collision. This method can help in understanding energy exchanges during molecular collisions and aid in interpreting spectra from both laboratory and astrophysical sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
