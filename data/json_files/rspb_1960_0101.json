They found that the embryos develop through a unique process of gastrulation, with an unusual pseudoblastopore. The larvae do not have a typical metameric segmentation and do not feed. The author also observed the metamorphosis process, during which the larvae exchange a pelagic for a benthic life. The study provides valuable insights into the development of solenogastres and their relationship to other mollusks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
