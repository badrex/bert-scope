They found that the blood sugar levels remained stable during hibernation, possibly due to stored fat being converted into sugar. The authors also observed that the marmots' sensitivity to touch decreased during hibernation compared to their sensitivity during normal sleep.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mammal Physiology"}
