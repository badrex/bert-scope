The authors found that the rate of secretion and the percentage of salts in saliva are influenced by these factors, and that the percentage composition of saliva is determined by the strength of the stimulus, the character of the blood, and the amount of blood supplied to the gland.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
