They observed various appearances of the discharge in residual gases at different pressures and currents. They also studied the resistance of the tubes and the rate of fall of potential throughout the length of the vacuum tube. The authors found that the discharge in a vacuum tube does not differ essentially from that in air and other gases at ordinary atmospheric pressures, and that the constancy of the difference of potential between the electrodes of a given tube and gas is maintained for all variations in the value of the current.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
