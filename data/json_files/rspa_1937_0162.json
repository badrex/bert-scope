They compared free-air and air-wall chambers and found that air-wall chambers were suitable for gamma-ray dosage measurement. The study aimed to establish a single unit of dosage for both X-ray and gamma-ray therapy, improving cancer treatment effectiveness.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
