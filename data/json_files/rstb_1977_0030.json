It explores three types of hydration behavior common to biopolymer systems: ionic hydration, specific hydration, and hydrophobic hydration. The study aims to understand how these interactions influence biopolymer conformational equilibria and the role of solvent perturbations in triggering biological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
