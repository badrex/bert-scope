They used mechanical irritation by pressure on the nerve trunk to observe the effects on the heart, stomach, lungs, and other organs. The results provided insights into the sensory and motor functions of these nerves in both healthy and diseased states.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
