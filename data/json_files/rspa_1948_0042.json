The authors explore stress distribution in plates under isolated forces, comparing the results with the generalized plane stress theory. They provide numerical values for stress components and discuss the accuracy of the generalized plane stress theory in approximating the average stress values.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
