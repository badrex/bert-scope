The study covers gas flow through nozzles, liquid flow over broad-crested weirs, and liquid flow through Venturi flumes with various shapes. The author also demonstrates that the throat velocity in liquid flow is equal to the local velocity of a long wave.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
