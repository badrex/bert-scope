The author uses a digital computer and a fourth-order Runge-Kutta process to integrate the linear first-order differential equation. The numerical solution is compared with existing theories, showing that earlier theories are not accurate in predicting roll torque. The method can be applied to both hot and cold rolling situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metal Forming"}
