They discovered that the intensity of the sound produced by the gases and vapors was directly related to their absorption of radiant heat. The author also found that soap bubbles were suitable for sound lenses due to their flexibility and sensitivity to impulses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
