The study found that the mean chemical intensity for hours equidistant from noon is constant, and the daily maximum of chemical intensity corresponds to the maximum of the sun's altitude. The author also discusses the probable causes of the autumnal maximum in chemical intensity and the differences in chemical intensity between tropical and temperate regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
