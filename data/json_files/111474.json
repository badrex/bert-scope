The authors determined the conducting powers of various metals and alloys, showing the influence of impurities and the effect of alloying on heat conduction. They also explored whether alloys are simple mixtures of metals or definite compounds, classifying them into three categories based on their conducting powers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
