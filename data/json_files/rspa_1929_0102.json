They propose a five-dimensional approach to unify the theories of gravitation and electromagnetism, and discuss the role of symmetric and antisymmetric components in these equations. The study aims to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the quantum theory and its relation to electromagnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
