These hybrid cells contain nuclei from both species and can synthesize proteins, DNA, and undergo mitosis. The research offers new possibilities for studying nucleo-cytoplasmic relationships and genetic regulation. The author also discusses the potential for further research and the compatibility of cells from different vertebrate species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
