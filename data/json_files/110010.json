The metals that form valuable alloys with steel include silver, platinum, rhodium, iridium, osmium, and palladium. The authors describe the processes of analysis they used to ensure the composition and perfection of the alloys. They also mention the rapid action of dilute sulfuric acid on these alloys, which is attributed to electrical action and the formation of voltaic combinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
