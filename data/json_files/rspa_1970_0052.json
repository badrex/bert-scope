The authors found that the quenching effect is independent of the phosphorescent additive and depends on the molecular mass, side branching, and phase changes of the alkanes. The results show that the crystal structure of the base material has a direct impact on the phosphorescence quenching properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
