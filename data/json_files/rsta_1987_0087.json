The authors study the chemical and mineralogical composition of these particles, comparing them to meteorites and establishing their extraterrestrial origin through the detection of space-exposure effects. The research focuses on two main types of particles: those containing hydrated minerals and those that are anhydrous. The authors conclude that most particles have elemental compositions similar to CI and CM chondrites, suggesting that they may be representative samples of the Solar System's minor bodies."}
