A statistical theory called collisional-radiative recombination is developed, which considers the interaction between collisional and radiative processes. The study focuses on hydrogen-ion plasmas and finds that the collisional-radiative recombination coefficient increases with the number density of free electrons. The results also suggest that the coefficient is not very sensitive to the species of singly charged ions involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
