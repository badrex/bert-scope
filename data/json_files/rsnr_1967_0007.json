The manuscript demonstrates how Newton's belief in an ethereal medium, or aether, was influenced by Francis Hauksbee's experiments on electro-luminescence and electrical attraction. Newton considered incorporating this experimental evidence into his work, but ultimately decided to present it in the form of new observations rather than as part of his 'Opticks' theory.", "scientific_discipline": "History of Science > Physics"}
