The research focuses on understanding the physics of compressed ice in Alpine glaciers and how it relates to the behavior of disturbed Pleistocene Drift deposits. The findings provide insight into the movement and structure of ice under pressure, which is essential for understanding the behavior of glaciers and their impact on the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
