The fertilized ova pass into the uterus in April, and the young are born in May of the following year. The author describes the various stages of development, including the formation of the ectoderm and endoderm, the growth of the mesoderm, and the appearance of appendages such as antennae, jaws, and legs. The study provides valuable insights into the reproductive and developmental processes of annelids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
