They find that these salts possess unique properties, such as higher refractive power and greater dispersion of the spectrum compared to other salts in the nickel group. The study also reveals that the thallium salts are isomorphic with the rubidium salts in the series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
