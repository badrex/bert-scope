The authors found that methylation of the 5' region of the transposase gene is correlated with the inactivation of the Ac transposable element. They propose a model in which the Ac transposase binds to the 5' region of the element, preventing methylation after replication. This discovery sheds light on the regulation of gene expression and the role of epigenetic modifications in plant genetics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
