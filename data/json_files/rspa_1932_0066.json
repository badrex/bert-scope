They discovered that there is an abrupt decrease in resistance at a temperature slightly lower than the critical temperature for direct current superconductivity. This finding has implications for understanding the behavior of metals in high-frequency electromagnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
