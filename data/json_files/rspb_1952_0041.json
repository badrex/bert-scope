Food transmission plays a crucial role in communication within the colony, helping to determine the tasks each worker performs. The study also shows that the duration of foraging life is shorter for bees that start foraging at a later age, indicating that senility may play a part in determining the longevity of these bees.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
