They discovered that the kinetic equations of unimolecular consecutive reactions are followed, with the velocity constants being proportional to the iodine concentration. The catalyst seems to attack a complex molecule at one specific point, leading to a simpler and more efficient activation mechanism compared to the uncatalyzed reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
