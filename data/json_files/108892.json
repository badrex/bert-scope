Clerk Maxwell proposed a theory of the electromagnetic field, explaining that electromagnetic phenomena are produced by actions in the surrounding medium rather than direct forces acting at a distance. He introduced the concept of an ethereal medium, capable of storing and transmitting energy, and described the electromagnetic field as a part of space containing electric or magnetic bodies. Maxwell's theory includes the principles of electromagnetic induction, and it laid the foundation for modern electromagnetism and the development of electromagnetic theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
