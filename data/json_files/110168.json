The author concludes that the data used in the calculations are more uncertain in extreme cold, but the general agreement of the results supports the validity of the observations. Captain Parry's experiments provide strong evidence of his exemplary accuracy despite the challenges faced during Arctic exploration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
