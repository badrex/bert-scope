The authors analyze the populations of different rotational levels and propose that there is a source of ionization of hydrogen in the clouds. They also explore the mechanisms by which excited vibrational-rotational levels are populated, including fluorescence and molecular formation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
