The study examines the effects of critical level absorption, wave amplification, and the valve effect, using a full wave treatment that includes variations in the basic state. The existence of a wave-invariant quantity is proven, which can be used as a measure of the wave's intensity. The research covers various models, including a Boussinesq fluid, magnetic-acoustic-gravity waves, and an anisotropic system with an inclined magnetic shear."}
