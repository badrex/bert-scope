They identify various types of cortex and analyze the distribution of ganglionic formations and the central projections of the olfactory medulla. The study provides insights into the differences between the brains of rodents and humans, as well as the significance of sulci and fissures in structurally differentiated realms of the cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
