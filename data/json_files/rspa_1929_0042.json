The authors use magnetic analysis to study the behavior of electrons after collision and find that the intensity of scattering depends on the velocity of the electrons after collision and the angle of their path. The results show that the excitation of the triplet system is small or absent at high velocities, and the efficiency of ionization is at its maximum around 200 volts. The authors also discuss the discrepancy between their results and previous findings, and the potential application of wave mechanics to the study of electron scattering in helium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
