They argue that the winds and isobars in weather charts accurately represent the motion of air in cyclones, contrary to the claims made by other researchers. The author also explains the differences between ordinary cyclones and secondary cyclones, and provides a visual representation of how clouds move within a cyclone.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
