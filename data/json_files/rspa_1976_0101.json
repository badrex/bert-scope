They transform Teukolsky's radial equation into the form of a one-dimensional wave equation, allowing for a more accessible approach to understanding the non-axisymmetric perturbations. The study provides insight into the behavior of black holes and the potential implications for astrophysics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
