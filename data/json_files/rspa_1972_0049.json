These depressions, called thermokarst, are characterized by their shallow depth, variable size, and clustered distribution. The authors compare these features to similar formations in Arctic regions, such as pingos, and discuss their geological and geographical distribution, as well as their formation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomorphology"}
