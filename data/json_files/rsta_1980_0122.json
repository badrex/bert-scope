They found that the presence of 0.2% Mo improves the toughness and lowers the transition temperature. However, stress-relieving heat treatments cause a decrease in toughness in alloys without Mo, while steels containing Mo show a slight increase. Titanium additions were found to refine the as-welded microstructure and decrease grain boundary carbides in the weld deposit.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
