They used this method to study the effects of radiation, radiosensitizing and radioprotecting drugs on tumors and normal tissues. The techniques were also applied to study the influence of hormones on the lactating mammary gland in rats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
