The coagulation material is not like fibrin found in vertebrate blood but is more closely related to mucin. The study provides insights into the cellular and molecular processes involved in the coagulation of echinoderm fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
