The research involved observing the Rydberg series of bands in the vacuum ultraviolet region and analyzing isotope shifts to identify the carrier molecules. This work helped to understand the fine structure and chemical bonding of these radicals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
