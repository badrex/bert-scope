They develop a model for ECAM and analyze its applications in fine-hole drilling and surface finishing. The analysis shows that ECAM can remove surface irregularities at a faster rate and with less loss of stock metal than traditional methods, making it a promising alternative for various industrial applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Manufacturing and Machining"}
