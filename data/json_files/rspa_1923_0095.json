The authors designed three different apparatus to test materials with different characteristics, focusing on accuracy and efficiency. The technique involved measuring the energy input and output, as well as the temperature gradient across the material. The results provide valuable data for understanding and improving the thermal properties of materials in various industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering > Heat Transfer"}
