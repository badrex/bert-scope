The authors observed swarms in Iran and Kenya, analyzing factors such as locust condition, wind, gregariousness, the sun, and landscape. They found that wind plays a crucial role in determining flight direction and that locusts have a unique pattern of sensory reactions that contribute to their migratory behavior. The key to understanding locust migration lies in the balance between the insect's locomotion and sensory regulation tendencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
