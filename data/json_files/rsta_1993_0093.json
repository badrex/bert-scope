The author discusses the role of simulations in testing modern theories of liquid crystal phase transitions, structure, and dynamics. Two specific examples are explored: the simulation of twisted nematic liquid crystals and the explanation of diffusive behavior in isotropic and nematic liquids using kinetic theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
