He found that weak electric currents could decompose certain saline combinations and reduce metal oxides, such as copper, lead, and tin. Bird also developed a new apparatus to provide a continuous and equal current of low intensity for his experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
