It explains how the technique works, the evidence supporting the idea that membranes split during freeze-etching, and the interpretation of the resulting fracture faces. The author also discusses the physical events that occur when membranes are fractured in the frozen state and replicated, providing insights into the structure and composition of biological membranes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
