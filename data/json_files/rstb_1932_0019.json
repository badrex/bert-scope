They found that a slight vertical cut in the area from which the next primordium was due to arise caused the growing point to shift, leading to changes in the arrangement of subsequent leaves. This supports the theory that new leaf-primordia arise in the first space that attains a certain minimum width and distance below the apex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
