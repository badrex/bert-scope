The red spectrum is produced by a lower electromotive force, while the blue spectrum requires a higher electromotive force and a hot spark. The author also discusses the process of purifying argon gas and the differences in spectra when mixed with nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
