The authors propose that water transport across epithelia is coupled to active solute transport by means of local osmotic gradients set up within the epithelium. They also explore the ion selectivity of epithelial cells and the mechanisms behind it.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
