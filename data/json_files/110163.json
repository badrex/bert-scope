He used needles from Professor Hansteen and Dollond, and performed the experiments at various locations. The results showed that the horizontal directive force in Paris was greater than in London, with a ratio of 1068:1000. The intensity of the directive force on the dipping needle was found to be slightly greater in London than in Paris.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
