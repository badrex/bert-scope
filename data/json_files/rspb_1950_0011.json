This phosphagen is different from arginine phosphate, previously assumed to be present in invertebrate muscles. The study also found a second phosphagen, possibly creatine phosphate, in certain annelids but not in gephyreans. The distribution of these phosphagens does not seem to be correlated with physiological activity or environmental factors. The research emphasizes the chemical distinction between Annelida and Gephyrea from other invertebrate groups and supports the echinoderm-hemichordate theory of vertebrate ancestry.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
