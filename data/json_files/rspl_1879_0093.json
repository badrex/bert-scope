Clerk Maxwell discusses a possible method to detect the motion of the solar system through the luminiferous ether using observations of the satellites of Jupiter. He explains that this method could provide an estimate of the direction and magnitude of the sun's velocity with respect to the ether, which is essential for understanding the nature of light and its interactions with matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Satellite Observations"}
