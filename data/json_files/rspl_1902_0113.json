The detector consists of multiple bundles of iron wires, each with its own magnetizing and demagnetizing coil. The device can be used to measure the intensity of Hertzian wave radiation and has potential applications in the design of radiators and transmitters for wireless telegraphy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
