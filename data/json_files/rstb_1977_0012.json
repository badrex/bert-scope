The authors discuss the factors that affect the duration of meiosis, such as environmental factors, nuclear DNA content, ploidy level, and genotype. They also highlight the importance of meiotic timing experiments in understanding the meiotic process and its implications for the organism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
