It discusses the role of local diamagnetic currents, paramagnetic circulations, and molecular orbital theory in understanding these shifts. The authors provide calculations and examples for various molecules, including acetylene, water, and ammonia.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
