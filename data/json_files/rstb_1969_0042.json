The first six are nauplius larvae, while the seventh is the cypris larva, which is adapted for locating a suitable place for settlement. The research provides insights into the morphological changes that occur during metamorphosis, from the nauplius through the cypris to the young adult stage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
