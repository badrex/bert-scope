Cayley, explores the theory of sextactic points, which are singular points on a plane curve where six consecutive points lie in a conic. The study involves complex mathematical calculations and transformations to understand the properties of these points and their impact on the curve's behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
