Most New World bird species have small geographic ranges, and the frequency distribution of logarithmically transformed ranges is left-skewed. The study finds that the geographic range size-body size relation is approximately triangular, with small-bodied species having either large or small ranges, and large-bodied species having only large ranges. The maximum range size attained by species is relatively constant across body sizes but falls short of the maximum possible given the land area of the New World. There is a latitudinal gradient in the size of species' geographic ranges, with species having mid-points at high latitudes either side of the equator tending to have large range sizes, and those with mid-points at lower latitudes tending to have small range sizes. Migrant birds have larger geographic ranges, on average, than residents, but their larger ranges are not the simple consequence of these other patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
