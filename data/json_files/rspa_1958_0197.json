The authors analyze the atomic structure, density, and thermal expansion coefficients of ice, and explore the hydrogen bonding and molecular orientations within the ice lattice. They also examine the structure determination methods, including neutron diffraction, and the implications of these findings for understanding ice's behavior and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
