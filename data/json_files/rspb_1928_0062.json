They discovered that the total energy in a muscle twitch remains the same whether work is done or not. This finding challenges previous theories about muscle contractions and thermodynamics, suggesting that a muscle behaves like a simple viscous-elastic body, with the mechanical work subtracted from the heat liberated in relaxation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
