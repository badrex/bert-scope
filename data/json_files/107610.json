They discovered that these gases have varying specific gravities, combustibility, and illuminating power. The author also investigated the properties and composition of carburetted hydrogen gas, which is formed through the decomposition of water. This gas has important implications for understanding the chemical reactions and analysis of mixed combustible gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
