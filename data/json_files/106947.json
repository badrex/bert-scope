He divided the nerves and observed the effects on the animals' bodies, particularly on their thoracic and abdominal viscera. The experiments showed that the original power of action in these organs was independent of the nerves, and that the nerves could regenerate, which was a previously unobserved phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
