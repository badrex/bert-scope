He showed how phosphorus could be ignited and how it produced a blue flame and smoke. He also used the machine to create a glass-like substance called Vitrum Molle, which could be transformed into a solid, transparent material similar to glass. However, when exposed to air, the substance would eventually turn back into water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions"}
