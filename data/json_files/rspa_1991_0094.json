They find that the relationship is nonlinear and multivalued, leading to hysteresis and catastrophic changes in stress or strain rate under certain conditions. This work contributes to the understanding of electro-rheological fluids and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
