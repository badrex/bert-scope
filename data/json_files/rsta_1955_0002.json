They found that the intensity curves fall into three different types, suggesting that a common polypeptide-chain configuration, the alpha-helix, is present in most proteins. The method provides a simple and quick way to test various protein structure hypotheses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
