They found that birds have a unique ability to retain air and absorb carbon dioxide, which helps them maintain their high body temperature. The author also discovered that the air in birds' bones undergoes similar changes as in their air sacs, and the delicate membrane of the air-receptacles is permeable to air. Additionally, the author observed that birds lose less heat due to their thin skin, low vascularization, and excellent insulation provided by their feathers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
