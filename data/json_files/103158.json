Hauksbee conducts experiments to determine the proportion of the power of the load-stone at different distances. He uses a quadrant, a magnet, and two needles of different sizes to measure the angles made by the load-stone. Hauksbee finds that the load-stone's influence extends beyond the distances he tested, and he leaves the correction of his measurements to other experts in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
