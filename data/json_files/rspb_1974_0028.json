The results show that orchidectomy accelerates skin allograft rejection and increases cell-mediated immune responses, while having no direct effect on humoral antibody responses. The study also demonstrates that androgen administration can reverse the effects of orchidectomy on skin graft survival. The findings suggest that orchidectomy may augment cell-mediated immune responses without affecting B cell responses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
