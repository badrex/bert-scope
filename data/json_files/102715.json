Hauksbee, conducted an experiment to demonstrate that air springs can suffer from disorder due to a violent impulse, requiring time to recover their natural state. He used a condensing engine to compress air and observed the effects on the air springs. The experiment showed that the springs took time to recover their natural state, confirming the suggestion that air might suffer in its parts by force or unnatural extension.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
