It shows that ethylene acts as a positive regulator of root hair differentiation, promoting the development of hair cells in the root epidermis. This finding is relevant for understanding the complex processes of plant development and the role of ethylene in various plant species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
