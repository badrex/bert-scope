They identified four major vegetational stages and determined that the Hoxne Interglacial is of Great (Elster/Saale, Mindel/Riss) Interglacial age. The study provides insights into the vegetational and climatic history of the interglacial period between the Lowestoft and Gipping Glaciations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Quaternary geology"}
