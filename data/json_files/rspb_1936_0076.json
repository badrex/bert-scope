They found that injecting animals with extracts from different species' pituitaries could lead to the production of an antiserum that inhibits the action of pituitary hormones from other species. This discovery sheds light on the potential for counter therapies and the importance of separating pituitary hormones from their antigenic complexes or inhibitory co-hormones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
