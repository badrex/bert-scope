They studied the angular distribution of the scattering from 25 to 135 degrees and found it to be isotropic within the limits of error. The absolute differential cross-section for scattering at 90 degrees was measured and found to be 0.25 millibarns. The results can also be used to find the cross-section at 142 MeV.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
