He developed a passage-thermometer to measure the passage of heat through various substances, such as silk, wool, and cotton. The experiments showed that the density and internal structure of the materials played a significant role in their ability to conduct or insulate heat. This research could lead to improvements in fuel and clothing efficiency, increasing human comfort and convenience.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
