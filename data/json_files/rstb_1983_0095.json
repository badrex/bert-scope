The authors describe their efforts to develop a genetic transfer system within Bordetella and identify specific genetic sequences encoding several determinants of pathogenicity. They also discuss the challenges of working with fastidious microorganisms and the importance of understanding the genetic basis of pathogenicity to develop safe and effective vaccines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
