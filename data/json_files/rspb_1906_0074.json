They found that the amount of chloroform in the blood varies among different animals and that the difference between anesthetic and lethal doses is small. The authors also noted that chloroform rapidly leaves the blood after anesthesia is induced.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology and Pharmacology"}
