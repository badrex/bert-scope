The authors develop a quantitative theory that considers the membrane pores as independent capillaries lined with an electrical double layer and a diffuse counter charge in the pore solution. They analyze the pressure-driven and electro-osmotic flows and predict the observed types of transitions in fluxes and forces, providing a general understanding of the system's behavior. The study also presents a membrane cell design for testing the theory and compares observed and predicted current-voltage curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
