Horsburgh, observed a regular diurnal variation of the barometer within the tropics, with the greatest depression occurring around 4 am and 4 pm, and the greatest elevation happening between 8 am and noon, and from 9 pm to midnight. This phenomenon was observed on both land and sea, but the atmospheric effect on the barometer was found to be different between the two environments. The study provides valuable insights into the behavior of the barometer in tropical regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
