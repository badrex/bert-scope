They found that when yeast is grown in a medium containing hydrolyzed lactose, it acquires the ability to ferment galactose. The fermentation process involves the conversion of galactose into other compounds, including the production of extra carbon dioxide. The authors also discovered that adding phosphate or sodium arsenate to the fermenting mixture can speed up the fermentation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
