These cells have a stellate form and are connected to the odontoblast layer, contributing to the formation of the tooth's dentine. The nerve-end cells communicate with the deep plexus and form a network around the odontoblasts, providing essential information for tooth growth and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Developmental Biology"}
