In the first case, a man who consumed excessive prunes experienced prune-stone perforation in the intestinum rectum, leading to his death. In the second case, a 14-year-old boy with iliac passion was treated and later dissected to understand the cause of his death. These case studies provide insights into the effects of prune consumption and the importance of dissection in understanding medical conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Pathology"}
