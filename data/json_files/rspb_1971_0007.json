They discovered that the tubules possess a steroidogenic function distinct from the interstitium, and the Sertoli cells are likely the source of androgens and other compounds. This research contributes to the understanding of the immune response and the role of lymphocytes in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
