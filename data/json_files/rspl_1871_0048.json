They discover that different acids, such as hydrochloric, hydrobromic, and hydriodic, produce different outcomes in their reactions with the alkaloids. Additionally, the author finds that these alkaloids have a tendency to form polymerides, which serve as starting points for new series of derivatives. This research contributes to the understanding of the chemistry and potential applications of opium alkaloids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
