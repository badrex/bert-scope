They explore the importance of population size, habitat specificity, and geographical range in determining a species' likelihood of extinction. The author also highlights the role of mathematical models in understanding these phenomena and their implications for both modern and paleontological data.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
