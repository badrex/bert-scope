They discover that the unique appearance of gold-leaf, featuring black lines and varying thickness, is not due to the crystalline structure of the alloyed gold or the gold-beating process. The author concludes that the lines are likely caused by the softness of the pure gold and the process of beating.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
