They discovered that the bands are a superposition of bands arising from the M center, the M2 center, and higher aggregate centers. The structure and orientation of the M center were determined through the anisotropy of its optical absorption and fluorescence. The authors also studied the thermal orientation of the center in its ground state and the optical absorption of the center in different crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
