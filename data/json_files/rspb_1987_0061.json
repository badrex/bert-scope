The results show that Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 causes the release of calcium from internal stores and activates voltage-sensitive calcium channels in the surface membrane. This study contributes to understanding the role of Ins(1,3,4,5)P4 as an intracellular messenger in calcium signaling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular and Molecular Biology"}
