They found that the islets can transform from secretory tissue and that their number increases during gland activity. The experiments did not conclusively determine the islets' function but supported the idea that they represent an internally secreting stage in pancreatic tissue development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Histology"}
