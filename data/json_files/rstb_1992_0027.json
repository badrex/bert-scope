The research found that germination was not significantly affected by gap size, but was increased by soil exposure or disturbance. The results suggest that gap size may not influence the composition of colonizing vegetation by controlling seed germination, but an effect operating through differential mortality cannot be ruled out.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
