They discovered that auto-transplants had a higher success rate in both the anterior chamber and subcutaneous sites, while homotransplants were more likely to succeed in the anterior chamber. The study also found that simultaneous thyroid and spleen homotransplants had varying effects on the success of thyroid homotransplants, suggesting a possible cellular, humoral, or combined mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
