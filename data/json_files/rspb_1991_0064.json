These pseudogenes lack introns and have a similar structure to the functional Adh genes, suggesting they arose from reverse transcription. The pattern of base substitution in the pseudogenes differs between degenerate and non-degenerate codon positions in their functional paralogs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
