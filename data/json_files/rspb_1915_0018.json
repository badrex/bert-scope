These ganglia contain nerve cells that are related to the oculomotor nerve and are found at the level of the third cranial nerve. The existence of these ganglia in this species has not been recorded before. The author discusses the significance of these ganglia and their relation to the generally accepted belief in the homology of the oculomotor nerve with a ventral spinal root.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
