The author also observes that solar radiation appears to increase as the sun enters a white cloud, and conducts experiments with screens to determine the extent of this effect. Further research is needed to understand if this increase is due to radiation or reflection.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
