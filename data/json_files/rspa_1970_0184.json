They generated waves of known constant frequency and measured their amplitude as they progressed along the tunnel. The growth rate was calculated from these measurements and compared with theoretical predictions using the linearized theory of Miles and Benjamin. The study focused on water, dilute glycerol solutions, and solutions of a surface active agent, sodium lauryl sulfate, to understand the effect of these substances on wave damping and growth rates. The results showed good agreement with the theory for wind speeds up to 3, and the minimum velocity necessary to produce neutral waves on water was found to be independent of wavelength for lengths between 4 and 8 cm.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
