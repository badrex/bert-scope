The authors analyze data from the Apollo program and laboratory studies on lunar samples, confirming the predictions of Earth-based and spacecraft measurements of the lunar surface's dielectric properties. They also compare the electrical properties of the Moon, Mercury, Venus, and Mars, and discuss the potential impact of these properties on the surfaces of other planetary bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Planetary Geology"}
