The researchers found that the catalyst activity is influenced by the promoter concentration, with two peaks on the activity curve. The experiments were conducted using both autoclave and continuous hydrogenation plant methods, providing consistent results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
