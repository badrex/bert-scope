They examine the critical value of the coupling constant and determine it for states of any angular momentum and parity. The study focuses on meson-nucleon scattering and provides insights into the uniqueness of solutions in the context of nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
