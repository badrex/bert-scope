They discovered that the property responsible for the leaf's response to stimulation is similar to that found in animal structures. The author also investigated the effects of a weak voltaic current on the leaf's electromotive properties and found that the influence of this modification extended to both resting and excited states, suggesting an essential relationship between these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
