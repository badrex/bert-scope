The method reduces the system of coupled partial differential equations to a system of uncoupled 1-D Helmholtz equations, which can be solved easily. The resulting displacements are a summation of a regular elastodynamic term and a singular static term, both integrals over a unit sphere. This method allows for an efficient and relatively simple calculation of time-harmonic Green's functions for general anisotropic solids.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
