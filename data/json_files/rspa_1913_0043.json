They discovered that when a-bromoacyl haloids react with glucosamine hydrochloride in the presence of sodium hydroxide, the anhydrides are formed. This research contributes to the understanding of the synthesis and properties of complex proteins, specifically glucoproteins.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
