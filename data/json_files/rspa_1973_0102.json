They achieved this by controlled chloromethylation of anionic polystyrene, followed by reaction with butylamine and crosslinking with a diisocyanate in dilute solution. The number of crosslinks in each sample was determined by quantitative infrared studies. This research contributes to the understanding of polymer dimensions and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
