The researchers discovered that the hexagonal close-packed phase has a lower ideal resistivity than the body-centred cubic phase, while the residual resistivity remains independent of the structure. The study utilized temperature cycling and mechanical strain to analyze the properties of the two phases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
