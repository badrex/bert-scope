They found that vagal stimulation causes membrane hyperpolarization and an increase in membrane resistance in arrested preparations. The results suggest that vagal inhibition of pacemaker cells results solely from a suppression of pacemaker sodium currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
