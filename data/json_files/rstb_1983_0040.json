The authors focus on the phosphorylation of contractile proteins, such as troponin-I, C-protein, and myosin P-light chain, and their impact on cardiac function. They explain how phosphorylation of these proteins contributes to the increased rate of relaxation and changes in tension development in the heart in response to hormones and pharmacological agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
