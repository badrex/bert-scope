They demonstrate that ectodermal cells from the neural crest differentiate into cartilages of the visceral arches, odontoblasts, and possibly dermal bone osteoblasts. The author also shows that enamel organs of the teeth can form from ectodermal or endodermal cells. The germ-layer theory is found to have no invariable correlation with presumptive organ-forming regions or formed structures, leading to its abandonment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
