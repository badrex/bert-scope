They demonstrate the synthesis of formaldehyde from carbon dioxide and water using inorganic colloids, such as hydrated ferric oxide and uranium oxide, under sunlight exposure. This process could have played a crucial role in the evolution of life on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
