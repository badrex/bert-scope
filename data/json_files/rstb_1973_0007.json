The authors analyze the steady-state fluxes of ions, focusing on sodium, potassium, and chloride exchanges. They explore different models to estimate intracellular ion content and membrane permeability, highlighting the challenges in understanding the mechanisms of ion exchange in smooth muscle cells."}
