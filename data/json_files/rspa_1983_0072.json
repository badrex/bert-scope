The theory, based on the Vlasov theory of thin-walled beams, accounts for forced and free vibrations and includes orthogonality conditions. It offers an alternative to the modified Timoshenko theory and has implications for various areas of structural dynamics, including naval architecture.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
