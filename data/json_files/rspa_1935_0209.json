The authors investigate the conditions under which the fluid starts to move and the changes in heat transfer when motion begins. They find that the fluid becomes unstable for a certain temperature difference and observe the onset of convection in the fluid, which is consistent with theoretical predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
