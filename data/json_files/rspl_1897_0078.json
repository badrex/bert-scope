The study reveals significant differences in brain size, shape, and convolutions, suggesting that these extinct lemuroids had distinct neurological features and may have undergone unique evolutionary adaptations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolution and Comparative Anatomy"}
