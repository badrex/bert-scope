They discovered three categories of lymphatics: subhypodermic, dermic, and subepidermic. The subepidermic lymphatics have a rich plexus of nerves, which the authors found to be important for the distribution of nerves to the epidermis. The study also found that the lymphatics in the skin do not have any absorbing function and that sweat glands, sebaceous glands, hair muscles, fat cells, and nerve bundles do not possess lymphatics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
