They develop methods to inoculate the virus into the insects and study the transmission process. The results show that the transmission process occurs during the feeding of the insect, and the author provides evidence that the virus can be successfully transmitted through different methods of inoculation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
