They discovered that many of the observed changes in gas spectra are not due to the density of the gas but rather the intensity of the electric charge. This research helps to understand the behavior of gases under different conditions and the role of electricity in their spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
