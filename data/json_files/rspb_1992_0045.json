HlyX is homologous to FNR, an anaerobic transcriptional regulator in Escherichia coli. HlyX has no haemolytic activity but may activate a latent haemolysin gene in E. coli. The protein functions as an anaerobic activator and repressor of FNR-regulated genes in vivo. The specificity for activating the haemolytic response requires unique features in both the N- and C-terminal segments of HlyX.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
