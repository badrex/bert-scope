These devices have several advantages over traditional Schottky barrier varactors, including odd harmonic generation, large power handling, and large device area at high frequencies. Theoretical design and performance characteristics for triplers and quintuplers are discussed, along with an overview of multiplier experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Semiconductor Devices"}
