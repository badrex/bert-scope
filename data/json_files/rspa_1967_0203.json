They discovered two types of ion-pairs with different degrees of solvation, and proposed a dynamic model of ion-pairs instead of a static one. The presence of an alkyl substituent on carbon 10 increases the stability of the ion-pair absorbing at longer wavelengths. The study also suggests that the vibration of the ion-pair may affect the ratio of contact to solvent-separated ion-pairs.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
