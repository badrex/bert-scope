The researchers found that injury alters the relationship between a cutaneous stimulus and the sensation experienced, leading to decreased pain thresholds and increased pain from suprathreshold stimuli. They examined the properties of primary afferents and the central nervous system to understand the underlying mechanisms of these changes. The results suggest that injury-induced hyperalgesia is not solely due to changes in afferent sensitivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
