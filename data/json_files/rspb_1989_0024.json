It introduces the concept of aggregated Markov models and shows that certain similarity transformations can generate a class of equivalent models with the same observable statistics. The author applies this method to various simple channel models and discusses its applications and implications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biophysics"}
