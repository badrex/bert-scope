It discusses the historical background of apraxia and its classification, as well as the role of neuropathology in understanding higher motor functions. The article also explores the contribution of neurophysiology to the study of motor control and the importance of developing new theoretical models to accommodate the expanding body of experimental facts.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Neuropsychology", "sub_discipline": "Cognitive Function and Motor Control"}
