They describe the anatomy and skull development of the kiwi, focusing on the internal auditory meatus, the floccular fossa, and the structure of the dorsum sellae and pituitary floor. The findings contribute to the understanding of avian embryology and comparative anatomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
