The authors explore the behavior of turbulent wind fields and the coupling between scalar entities like heat, water vapor, and other biologically significant factors. They also discuss the implications of this theory for understanding and managing forest ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
