The authors explore the consequences of uncertainty in perception in a model of signaling during mate choice and present numerical results that demonstrate the impact of error-prone perception on the evolution of signaling strategies. They emphasize the need for further development of signaling theory to better understand complex communication systems in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
