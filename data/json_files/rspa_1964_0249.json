They determined the shape and size of the Fermi surface from the de Haas-van Alphen effect data alone and found good agreement with recent band structure calculations. The Fermi surface of beryllium consists of hole and electron surfaces of equal volume.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
