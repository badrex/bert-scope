The researchers varied the air-to-liquid momentum and kinetic energy ratios, Reynolds numbers, and Weber numbers to analyze the breakup length, frequency, droplet size distributions, and velocity characteristics. The findings reveal the deterministic nature of the liquid flow and provide insights into the atomization process, droplet size, and spray behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
