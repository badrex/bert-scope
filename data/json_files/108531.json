The compensation mechanism involves the use of metallic expansion to adjust the instrument's readings based on temperature changes, improving the accuracy of the measurements. This method allows for more precise deductions of magnetic force variations and better understanding of the earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
