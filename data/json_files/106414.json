He discovered that the structure of their vocal organs makes it impossible for them to articulate words like humans. Camper's research focused on the basis of the os hyoides and the membranous bag under the latissimi colli, which he found to be significantly different from human vocal organs. This study sheds light on the evolutionary differences between human and non-human primates' speech capabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
