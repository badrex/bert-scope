The virus is found to be a persistent type, with the aphis remaining infective for several days after feeding on infected plants. The infectivity of the aphis increases with the duration of feeding on both infected and healthy plants. The research raises questions about the classification of this virus as it does not fit the typical characteristics of non-persistent or persistent viruses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
