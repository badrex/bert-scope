They used a spirometer and an analytical apparatus to collect data on carbon dioxide excretion, the rate of respiration, and the effects of temperature, exertion, and season. The results showed that the amount of carbon dioxide varied depending on the individual, activity level, and environmental factors, with the lowest amounts occurring during the hot summer months.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
