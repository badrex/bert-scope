They derived accurate extinction curves for three galactic regions: Cygnus, galactic center, and anticenter. The results showed no variation in the extinction curves for different directions and indicated that the strong absorption band at 2200 A may require more than one type of particle for explanation.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Ultraviolet Astronomy"}
