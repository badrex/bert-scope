The authors conducted experiments using a new high resistance and observed discontinuities in the X-ray spectrum. They analyzed the data and compared it with previous studies, discussing the implications of their findings on atomic structure and the behavior of electrons in iron atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
