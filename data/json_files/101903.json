Wurtzelbaur and Bernard Walther comparing the latitude and obliquity of the ecliptic over 200 years. The findings show that the latitude of Nurenburg and the obliquity of the ecliptic have remained unchanged, which challenges the hypothesis of a translation of the Earth's poles. The author also mentions the importance of the latitude of Alexandria and the possibility of a sudden change in the Earth's axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Ecliptic and Latitude"}
