They found that in most cases, momentum and energy were conserved, and the predictions of the restricted principle of relativity held true. The study also suggested that energy loss due to radiation during these collisions is rare and occurs in less than a few percent of the total number of collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle physics"}
