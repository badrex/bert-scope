The activity of this system is controlled by Weismann's ring, which influences developmental processes during the larva's life. This dehydrogenase system is responsible for the unstable reducing power of the blood, leading to the inactivation of tyrosinase and the eventual hardening of the larval cuticle to form the puparium. The findings suggest the presence and later elimination of a juvenile hormone, similar to that found in Rhodnius by Wigglesworth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Development"}
