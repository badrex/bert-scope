The research focuses on their trunk and limb musculature, providing insights into their feeding apparatus and evolutionary relationships. The findings contribute to understanding the diverse feeding dynamics and life history of copepods, which are dominant in marine planktonic communities.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
