The fossils were carefully extracted from the coral-sand rock and analyzed, revealing differences in size and characteristics between the two species. The author compares the findings to a similar reptile species, Megalania prisca, and concludes that the differences between the two are significant enough to warrant a separate generic or sub-generic distinction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
