It discusses the effects of low temperatures on their physiology, metabolism, and behavior, as well as the different strategies they use to avoid freezing, such as supercooling and tolerance of extracellular ice. The article also highlights the importance of understanding these adaptations for practical applications in agriculture, forestry, and the preservation of insect material in cryobiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
