The experiments focused on the formation of platelets, which are found in type 1 natural diamonds in {100} planes. The process involved irradiating the diamonds with electrons to increase the mobility of nitrogen atoms, then heating them under high pressure to promote aggregation. The results provide insights into the conditions under which nitrogen aggregation occurs in natural diamonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
