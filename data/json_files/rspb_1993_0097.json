Both the algal and animal cell membranes have ATPase activity, suggesting that they can control the flux of nutrients across the symbiotic interface. The symbiosome membrane may play a significant role in controlling the availability of phosphorous compounds and other nutrients to the alga. This challenges the diffusion-depletion hypothesis, which proposes that symbiont demand is the primary determinant of nutrient supply to the symbiont cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
