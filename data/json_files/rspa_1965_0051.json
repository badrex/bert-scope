The author shows that the equations reduce to the spheroidal wave equation, and discusses the validity of the -plane approximation. The study also extends to internal (baroclinic) waves and suggests that some deep currents observed in the Atlantic may be planetary waves at the cutoff period.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysical Fluid Dynamics"}
