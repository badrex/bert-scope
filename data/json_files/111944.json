Brodie, investigates the decomposition of various oxygenated substances by peroxide of hydrogen. The study includes the decomposition of permanganic acid, ferricyanide, hypochlorite, and chromic acid. The author concludes that the oxygen in different peroxides behaves similarly and that the peculiarities in their reactions are due to the physical conditions and the substances they are associated with.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
