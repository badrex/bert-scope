They compared their findings with Hartree-Fock calculations and identified most of the energy levels, providing a detailed analysis of low energy lines. This research contributes to the understanding of atomic physics and the identification of energy levels in atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
