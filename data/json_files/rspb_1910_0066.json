They find that the ancestral correlations diminish in a geometrical progression, and the degrees of resemblance between parent and offspring and between brethren are nearly equal. The study also highlights the importance of considering environmental influences on correlations and the value of using determinantal theory in understanding heredity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
