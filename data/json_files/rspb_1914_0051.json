They found that the flies mainly feed on mammalian blood (99%) from antelope species and a small amount of avian blood (1%). There is no difference in feeding habits between male and female flies, and they likely feed once every five to six days. This research helps to understand the transmission of trypanosomes, which cause sleeping sickness in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
