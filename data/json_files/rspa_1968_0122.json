They used two series of high molecular weight polymers, esters of polyglutamic acid and polymers with hydrocarbon side-chains. The study combined standard surface chemistry methods with infrared spectroscopy, deuterium exchange, and electron diffraction to understand the structure and behavior of these monolayers. The results showed that the monolayers had a condensed ordered array of alpha-helices and provided insights into hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic interactions at the asymmetric water/polymer/air interface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
