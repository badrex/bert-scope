The authors employed a platymeter and a sliding condenser to determine the capacity of a condenser. They found that the specific inductive capacity of paraffin remained constant at 1.977, with air taken as unity, regardless of temperature changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism and Electrodynamics"}
