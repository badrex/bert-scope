They find that these divergences do not cancel among themselves and that higher loop divergences may not be helpful due to ambiguities in their evaluation. The study concludes that a modification of Einstein's theory is needed for a finite theory of gravity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
