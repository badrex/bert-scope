They found that the dystrophin molecule is arranged close to the cytoplasmic face of the plasma membrane and forms an interconnecting network. This study provides insights into the role of dystrophin in normal muscle cell biology and its potential implications for muscular dystrophy disorders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
