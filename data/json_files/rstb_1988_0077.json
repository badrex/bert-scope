The authors review the current understanding of inositol phosphate metabolism and propose a coupled mechanism for receptor-stimulated calcium control involving inositol trisphosphate and inositol tetrakisphosphate. They also explore the possibility of inositol phosphates regulating calcium entry and intracellular calcium mobilization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
