The study aimed to understand the combinations of these abnormalities and the directions in which they chiefly tend. The author tabulated the results and provided detailed descriptions of various muscle variations, including the cleido-occipital muscle, epigastric slips of the pectoralis major, and the chondro-coracoid muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Anatomy and Physiology"}
