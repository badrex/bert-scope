They discovered the \"motor\" area's location and extent, as well as the representation of various body regions' musculature in the brain. The study also discussed the effects of ablations in the precentral and post-central gyri on movement and paresis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
