They found that the character of the secondary spectrum depends on the conditions of excitation and pressure of the gas. The authors also extended Fulcher's first band into the infra-red and analyzed the wave-numbers of the members of the Sx, S2, and S3 bands. Their findings contribute to the understanding of the quantum theory of band spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
