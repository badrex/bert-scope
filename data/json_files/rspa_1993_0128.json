The model has an analytical solution and can investigate the effects of control parameters on the stress buildup and release phases. The model exhibits seismic or aseismic steady-state solutions depending on the control parameter values and provides insights into lithosphere dynamics and earthquake recurrence times.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
