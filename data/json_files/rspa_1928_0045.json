They analyze various scenarios, including rigid conducting boundaries, and discuss the effects of heat conduction and viscosity on fluid motion. The author also explores the analogy between fluid layers heated from below and liquid between rotating coaxial cylinders.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
