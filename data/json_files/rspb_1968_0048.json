The main alkaloid responsible for this effect is agroclavine, which suppresses mammary gland hypertrophy and leads to pup mortality due to malnutrition. When the alkaloidal diet is discontinued before parturition, there is a rapid recovery, and the pups can grow normally.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproduction and Development"}
