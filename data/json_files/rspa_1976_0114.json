The spectrum shows at least 10 discrete features and a broad modulation in the continuous absorption above the threshold. The spectrum is dominated by a 'giant resonance' and is discussed in relation to previous photoabsorption data for nearby elements in the periodic table.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
