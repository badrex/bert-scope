The research focuses on the role of vertebrate animals in seed dispersal and the analysis of arils in six Aglaia species and four other plants. The findings reveal that bird-dispersed Aglaia seeds have a high lipid content, while primate-dispersed species have higher levels of free carbohydrates. The results contribute to the understanding of seed dispersal mechanisms in tropical rainforests.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology", "sub_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Ecology"}
