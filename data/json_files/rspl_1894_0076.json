The author derives equations connecting tesseral harmonics and presents their applications, such as calculating the resistance of pipes and determining the mutual potential energy of two layers of gravitating matter on spheres. The article also discusses the stable positions of ellipsoids in space.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
