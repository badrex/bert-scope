They discuss the magnetic declination, disturbances, and the relationship between these phenomena and auroras. The findings are compared with other stations on the North American continent, and the authors conclude that the disturbances follow a pattern related to the winter season and the equinox.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
