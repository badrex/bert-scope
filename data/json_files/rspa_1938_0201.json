They used a direct shadow method to photograph the pressure wave system and developed a method to estimate the pressure amplitude of the wave. The findings provide insights into the formation of sound waves and the potential for reducing airscrew noise.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
