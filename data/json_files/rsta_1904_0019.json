They find that the relationship between magnetic quantities and sun-spot frequency is complex and influenced by factors such as the season and the specific period of observation. The study contributes to the understanding of the connection between solar activity and Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
