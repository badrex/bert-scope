They discovered that a large part of the epithelium of the oral siphon is derived from the primitive neural tube of the embryo. The study provides a satisfactory explanation of the opening of the neural gland or hypophysis into the oral siphon and discusses the homologies between tunicates, cephalochordates, and vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
