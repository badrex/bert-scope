The crystal is found to be structurally monoclinic with two molecules in the unit cell. The benzene rings are regular hexagons, and the nitro-groups have unequal N-O distances. The crystal is optically negative and strongly doubly refracting, which is useful for understanding its optical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
