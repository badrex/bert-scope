The authors measured the temperature dependence of the paramagnetic susceptibilities of single crystals and analyzed the molecular susceptibilities to understand the relationship between the molecular axes and the ligand field. The results provide insights into the electron distribution in transition metal complexes and organometallic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystal Field Theory"}
