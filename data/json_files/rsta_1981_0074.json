The valleys contain Tertiary sediments that define an asymmetrical basin bounded by a major listric normal fault with 3.0-4.5 km of displacement. The Tertiary depocentre shifts from west to east with continued slippage through time, with the greatest movement occurring in the Miocene and post-Miocene. The valleys' structural development is complex, with variations in Tertiary stratigraphy and the presence of pre-Miocene sections in some sub-basins.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
