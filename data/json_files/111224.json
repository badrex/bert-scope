This finding was overlooked by Dr. Nelson, who later claimed to have established the fact in his research on Ascaris Mystax. Barry's work on mammiferous ova provided evidence that the penetration of spermatozoa into the ovum was an established fact before Nelson's research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
