They analyze both two-dimensional and circular cracks, providing stress components, tabulations, and graphical representations of stress distribution. The research contributes to understanding the conditions for rupture in non-ductile materials like glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
