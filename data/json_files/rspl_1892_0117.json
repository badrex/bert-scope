They propose that the coagulation is due to a precipitation of cell-fibrinogen in the plasma under the influence of an excess of weak acid. This process has a close analogy to the precipitation of caseinogen from diluted milk by the addition of excess dilute acids. The author also notes that this coagulation does not occur in other plasmas or in blood with added peptone.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Blood and Plasma Coagulation"}
