The ganglion is divided into two distinct parts, one with large cells and the other with small microneurons. The research explores the input and output pathways, as well as the role of these small cells in the ganglion's function. The stellate ganglion is responsible for controlling the muscles of the mantle, which are involved in respiration and locomotion in cephalopods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
