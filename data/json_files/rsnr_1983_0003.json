It highlights the work of George Gabriel Stokes, Anders Jonas \u00c5ngstr\u00f6m, and other scientists in understanding the interaction of light with matter and the limitations of the undulatory theory. The article also introduces the phenomenon of fluorescence and its relation to energy conservation."}
