The author discovers that the size and shape of contrasting patches, as well as the brightness of the retinal image, significantly impact the minimum contrast perceptible by the human eye. The study suggests that increasing the visual angle of the field and working with a larger extent of the retina at a uniform brightness level can enhance photometric sensitivity and accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
