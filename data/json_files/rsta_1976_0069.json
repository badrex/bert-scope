It explores the anisotropic properties of different minerals, such as dia-, para-, and ferrimagnetic minerals, and their effects on the overall structure and behavior of rocks. The authors also highlight the importance of understanding anisotropy in geology and its applications in determining large-scale features of the Earth's crust and upper mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Rock Fabric Analysis"}
