They found that the biological activity of hexyl resorcinol is determined by the interfacial activity of the mixture, and that soap micelles can either accelerate or inhibit the penetration of the drug depending on their concentration. The maximum biological activity occurs at the critical concentration for micelle formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
