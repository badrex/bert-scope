The model specifies two shape parameters, apical curvature and the ratio of the mimicked vertical pressure gradient to internal coelomic pressure, which define a developmental morphospace for studying constraints and macroevolutionary dynamics in urchins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
