The research focuses on planetary waves, which are long-period currents influenced by the Earth's rotation. The paper compares the results of an exact computation with the -plane approximation, a simpler method that replaces the spherical ocean with a flat plane. The findings show that the -plane approximation can accurately predict the behavior of planetary waves in ocean basins.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
