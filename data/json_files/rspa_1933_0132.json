The authors found that most of the decrease in ignition temperature occurs when a critical pressure increment is reached, which varies slightly with the composition of the mixture. The results have significant implications for understanding the problem of \"knock\" in internal combustion engines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
