The author also discovers para-cathodic and dia-cathodic rays, which are emitted from the anti-cathode and have different properties compared to the ortho-cathodic rays. These findings contribute to the understanding of the behavior of cathode rays and the development of related technologies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
