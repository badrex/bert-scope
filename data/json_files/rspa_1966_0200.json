The results agree well with observed data, exchange-adiabatic calculations, and Born's first approximation. The study provides insights into the behavior of electrons when they collide with helium atoms, contributing to the understanding of atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
