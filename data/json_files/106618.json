He discovered that certain decompositions occur in spirit of wine that do not happen in water or in the dry way. He also found that sea salt, when added to metallic soap, can cause a double decomposition, forming an alkaline soap and a mild calcareous earth. This research sheds light on the chemical reactions and affinities of substances in spirit of wine and their potential applications in soap making.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alchemy"}
