The author argues that only a few substances, such as acetylcholine, adrenaline, and noradrenaline, can be considered true local hormones. These substances play a role in metabolism and cellular function, and their action is not limited to the molecule itself, as their metabolic products are also active. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the biochemical actions of these hormones and their potential role in regulating various physiological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
