They demonstrate that the intestinal glands are excitable and influenced by nerves in the body wall, and that stimulation of these nerves produces histological changes characteristic of secretion. The presence of a protease in the anterior intestine juice is confirmed, and the existence of nerve elements exciting the secretion of protease is demonstrated in the segmental nerves, body wall, and ventral regions of the septa in the anterior intestinal region. The significance of the nervous control of the secretion of intestinal protease in Lumbricus is discussed in relation to the factors known to influence secretion in vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
