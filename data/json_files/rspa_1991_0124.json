They use the plane Poiseuille flow as a model and derive the Landau equation to establish the complete equivalence between the two methods, emphasizing the importance of defining the disturbance amplitude correctly.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Fluid Dynamics"}
