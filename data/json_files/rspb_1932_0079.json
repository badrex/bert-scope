The study shows that intelligence grades continuously from high to low and can be divided into 10 grades. The author identifies two types of families with different genetic factors influencing intelligence, suggesting that inheritance plays a role in determining a person's intelligence.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Genetics"}
