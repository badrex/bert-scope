It discusses how these layers are modified when the Rossby number is not negligible, leading to changes in their thickness and structure. The study focuses on the rotating disk problem and source-sink flow in an annulus, providing insights into the behavior of these layers under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
