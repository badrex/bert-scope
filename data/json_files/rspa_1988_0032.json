The method involves polarizing the spin system in a high magnetic field, reducing it adiabatically to a lower value, and measuring the residual magnetic resonance signal after returning to the higher field. The technique has high sensitivity and can be applied to various nitrogen-containing compounds, providing valuable insights into their molecular structures and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR)"}
