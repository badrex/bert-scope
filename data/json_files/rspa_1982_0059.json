They determine the displacement field of the platelets, which leads to a suggestion for the possible structure of the platelets. The study provides insights into the nature of these platelets, which are still in doubt due to their irregular structures and unclear chemical composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
