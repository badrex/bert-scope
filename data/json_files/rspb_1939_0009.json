They found that mice painted with 3:4-benzpyrene had strongly positive results for photodynamic substances in their urine. The study suggests that blastogenic hydrocarbons can be converted by living tissues into photodynamic derivatives, which may be water-soluble oxidation products. This research has implications for understanding the relationship between blastogenic activity and photodynamic substances in cancer cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Oncology and Cancer Research"}
