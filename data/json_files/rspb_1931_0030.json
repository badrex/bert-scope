They found that even weak light can accelerate fat oxidation, making it essential to control light exposure to preserve food quality. The study also suggests that the potential storage life of fatty products may be affected by the methods used in their manufacture.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Kinetics"}
