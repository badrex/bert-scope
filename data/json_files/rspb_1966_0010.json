They prepared various tritium-labeled forms of vitamin D and found that [1a-3H]cholecalciferol was a suitable form for further metabolic studies. The study showed that much of the tritium from the labeled calciferols was found in the body water, and breakdown products of calciferol were present in the more polar fractions of the extracts of feces, which passed from the bile.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
