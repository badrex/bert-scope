They use statistical mechanics methods to account for multiple interactions between fibers and derive expressions for the composite's elastic constants, shear stress at the fiber-matrix interface, and the effects of fiber length distribution and geometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
