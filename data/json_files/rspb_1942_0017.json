They found that new genetic variation arises slowly through mutations and that large numbers of generations are needed for its effects to become noticeable. The study highlights the importance of understanding polygenic mutations in evolution and adaptation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
