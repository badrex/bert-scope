The author examines the species' behavior, the chemical composition of the silk, and the structure of the silk glands found in the male flies' fore-tarsi. The discovery of these glands provides insight into the evolution of silk production in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
