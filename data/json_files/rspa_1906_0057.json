They observe that solid bodies exhibit a foam-structure with walls and contents that contract differently during the solidification process. This research provides insights into the similarities between the freezing of water and other liquids, as well as the structure of metals and their surface properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
