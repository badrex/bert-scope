The researchers found that the large intestine has no action on carbohydrate absorption and that increasing fat in the diet led to a decrease in nitrogen elimination. The study also showed that the absorption of fat was not affected by the presence or absence of the large intestine. The total quantity of feces increased in both normal and operated dogs when the fat in the diet was increased, but the absorption of nitrogen was lower in dogs without a large intestine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
