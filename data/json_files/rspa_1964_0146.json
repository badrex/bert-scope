The authors observed the temperature dependence of the quantum yields of excimer and monomer fluorescence in seven different solvents. The results support the idea that the excimer formation process is diffusion-controlled and reversible, with the excimer binding energy being determined primarily by the magnitude of the attractive potential in the excimer configuration.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy and Fluorescence"}
