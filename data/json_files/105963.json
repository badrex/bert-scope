{"article_id": "105963", "revised_title": "Formation of Coral Islands: A Study on Low, Flat Islands in the Ocean", "semantic_tags": ["Geology", "Coral reefs", "Island formation", "Oceanography", "Natural history"], "tldr": "The author, Alexander Dalrymple, explains the formation of low, flat islands in the ocean through the growth of coral banks. These islands are formed by the accumulation of coral, sand, and other materials brought by the ocean currents and winds. The process involves the growth of coral banks, which become shallower and eventually turn into islands. The author also discusses the characteristics of these islands, such as their long and narrow shape, the presence of vegetation, and the potential for harbors and fishing grounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
