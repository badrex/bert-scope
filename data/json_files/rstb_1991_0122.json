The methods are based on the assumption that the signal can be represented as a discrete-time, finite-state, first-order, homogeneous Markov process, and the noise is white and Gaussian. The techniques can accurately estimate the signal model parameters and statistics, even when the amplitude of currents is small. The methods are also effective in dealing with records contaminated by deterministic interferences and decomposing the sum of two or more single-channel currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Signal Processing"}
