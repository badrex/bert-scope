They discovered that these temperature ranges indicate the existence of inequalities of the same periods, suggesting a cosmical origin. The authors also found that the phases of these inequalities may not be simultaneous at different locations, and they proposed a method to bring the phases more in line with one another. This research could help in understanding the relationship between solar activity and weather patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
