Horner introduced a new method for solving numerical equations of all orders through continuous approximation. This method, which can be seen as an extension of the calculus of derivations, is a versatile tool for both composition and analysis of various functions, but it is particularly useful for solving equations numerically.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical methods"}
