This discovery challenges previous theories that these animals do not belong to the mammal class due to the absence of mammary glands and nipples. The author's findings support the classification of monotremes as a distinct order of mammals, bridging the gap between reptiles and mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Mammalogy"}
