They found that the composition of horse urine varies widely, even when the horse's diet and conditions remain the same. The author also observed differences in urine composition based on the horse's activity level, season, and other factors. The study provides valuable insights into horse nutrition and veterinary science.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
