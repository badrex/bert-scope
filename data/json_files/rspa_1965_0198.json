They discovered that glyoxal acts as a degenerate branching intermediate in the reaction, and the course of the oxidation can be explained by a degenerately branched chain reaction. The results challenge the recent suggestion that the oxidation of acetylene does not involve degenerate branching and that glyoxal is a by-product rather than the key intermediate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
