It discusses the changes in community structure, species richness, and individual abundances near platforms. The study reveals that some platforms have a positive impact on benthic communities, while others cause significant declines in numbers of individuals. The article highlights the importance of monitoring and managing the environmental impact of offshore activities.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
