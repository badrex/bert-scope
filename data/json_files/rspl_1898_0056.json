They discovered that the efficiency of R\u00f6ntgen ray production depends on the angle of the anti-cathode and the distance between the cathode and anti-cathode. The author also observed that a significant portion of R\u00f6ntgen rays comes from the glass of the tube, which they suggest may be positively charged streams proceeding from the anti-cathode.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
