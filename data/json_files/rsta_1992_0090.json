Unlike previous cases of weak scattering, pulsars exhibit two types of variability: diffractive scintillation and refractive scintillation. The author reviews the physics of various scintillation regimes, summarizes basic theoretical results, and discusses imaging in the presence of strong scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
