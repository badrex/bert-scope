The results suggest that strabismic and anisometropic amblyopes have different neural bases and that all forms share a common feature of large threshold losses relative to suprathreshold anomalies. The findings raise questions about our understanding of contrast-coding in normal vision and its perceptual importance.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
