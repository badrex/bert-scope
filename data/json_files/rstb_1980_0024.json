They discovered significant differences in the anatomy compared to previous accounts, such as the presence of inner circular body wall muscle and a prominent levator of the leg. These findings contribute to understanding the evolution of arthropod locomotion and the phylogenetic position of Onychophora.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Invertebrate anatomy and physiology"}
