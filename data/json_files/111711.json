W. Hofmann investigates the oxide of triethylphosphine, a phosphorus-based compound, and its properties. He describes its crystallization, solubility, and reaction with other compounds, such as iodide and bromide of zinc. Hofmann also examines the compound's vapor density and its behavior when mixed with air. The research contributes to the understanding of phosphorus-based compounds and their applications in chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
