When placed horizontally, the nodes of grass stalks bend upwards due to increased growth on the lower side. This phenomenon is explained by the presence of mobile amyloplasts in the cells, which move to the lower side when the plant is horizontal. The role of auxin in controlling elongation growth is also explored, showing that it stimulates cell growth in the nodes of grasses. This research has implications for understanding plant growth and development, as well as potential applications in agriculture and space biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
