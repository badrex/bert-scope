The authors use Hartree-Fock functions for ion states and variational principles to obtain coupled integro-differential equations for radial functions. They calculate collision strengths for inelastic collisions in configurations q to 5 and discuss the implications of their findings for understanding the spectra of gaseous nebulae and deducing ion abundances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
