They discovered that there are critical velocities and critical points at which the jet length changes suddenly. The authors also investigated the influence of surface tension on these critical points and found that the critical head rises as the surface tension increases. They applied Lord Rayleigh's theory to explain the factors that determine the jet length and the conditions under which the jet breaks down.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
