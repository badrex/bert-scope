They derive the force function using general differential equilibrium equations and demonstrate that the boundary of the configuration must be either plane or spherical. The study applies dynamical principles to phenomena in electricity, magnetism, heat, and elasticity, introducing coordinates to fix the configuration of the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
