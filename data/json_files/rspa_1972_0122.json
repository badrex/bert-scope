Kinetic and analytical studies showed that 3-methylpentylperoxy radical isomerization occurs, leading to the formation of (3- and y-hydroperoxyalkyl radicals. The results indicate that there is a greater tendency for methyl groups to migrate than ethyl groups during the decomposition of hydroperoxyalkyl radicals. The study provides insights into the differences in the oxidation mechanisms of alkanes with varying molecular structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
