They found that dialysis with TMA reduced the size of the initial peak of the fast-inactivating current and increased the size of the final plateau of the non-inactivating open state. The reversal potential for sodium currents was lower than that for potassium currents, and the time constant for inactivation of the sodium system was slightly increased during dialysis with TMA.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
