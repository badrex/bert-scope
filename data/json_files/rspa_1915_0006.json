The authors assume the tube to be an infinite right cylindrical shape with a perfect conductor material and an empty or air-filled interior. They focus on axially symmetrical, permanent-type waves and analyze the mathematical and physical aspects of the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Waves"}
