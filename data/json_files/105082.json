Smeaton, describes his improvements to the air-pump, focusing on enhancing rarefaction and measuring the expansion of air. He addresses two main issues with existing air-pump designs: the difficulty in opening valves and the inability to achieve a complete vacuum due to air trapped under the piston. Smeaton's improvements include a new valve design and a single-barrel construction that allows for greater rarefaction and easier operation. He also develops a new gage for measuring air expansion with a high degree of accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
