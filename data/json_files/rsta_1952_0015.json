The authors discovered layers of sedimentary and crystalline rock, with varying thicknesses and velocities, providing insights into the geology and history of the area. This method expanded the understanding of deep ocean structures and contributed to the development of future deep-sea exploration techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
