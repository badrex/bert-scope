They discovered three sets of microfibrils in the side walls of the algae cells, which are oriented in different directions. The structure of the side walls can be related to a grid of intersecting lines, and the microfibrils are interwoven within and between lamellae. The findings provide insights into the orientation and deposition of cellulose microfibrils in these species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
