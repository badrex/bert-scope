They found that the deformation is due to the anisotropy of thermal expansion in the crystals of these metals. The persistence of lattice distortions is shown by X-ray photographs and recrystallization after the cyclic treatment. The implications of this phenomenon are particularly exemplified in a comparison of tin-base and lead-base bearing alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
