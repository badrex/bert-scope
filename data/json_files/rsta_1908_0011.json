The authors designed a large steel enclosure capable of adapting to various requirements and conducted experiments to investigate the effects of high pressure on electric furnace reactions. The research aimed to determine the correlation between physical conditions and chemical effects in the electric furnace and the direct results produced by high gaseous pressures."}
