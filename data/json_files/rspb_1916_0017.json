These spicules are composed of colloidal silica and are unique in their gelatinous, water-absorbent nature. The author also investigated the origin of these spicules, finding them to be associated with large spherical cells, or scleroblasts, in the sponge's mesogloea. These findings provide insight into the structure and formation of siliceous spicules in sponges.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Sponge Biology"}
