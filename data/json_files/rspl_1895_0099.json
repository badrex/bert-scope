They used a vacuum bulb and induction coil to produce X-rays and enclosed the apparatus in a metal-lined box to screen it from electrical disturbances. The results showed that X-rays do not cause a significant change in the contact potential difference between metal plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
