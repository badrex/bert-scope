The coin features two Punic characters, which the author suggests may be pronounced as Aleph and Koph, hinting at a connection to a notable city in either Sicily or Africa. The author also explores the possibility that the coin was struck in Agrigentum, a famous ancient city in Sicily, and suggests that the coin's globule may be an uncial mark denoting its weight or value.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Numismatics"}
