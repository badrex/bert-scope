They discovered that the haemagglutinin is a trimer made up of two disulphide-linked glycosylated polypeptides, HAX and HA2. The proteolytic cleavage of a precursor glycopolypeptide is essential for the formation of infectious virus particles. The amino and carboxyl terminus sequences of HAX and HA2 were analyzed, revealing similarities and differences between haemagglutinin subtypes. The study provides insights into the structure and function of the haemagglutinin protein in the influenza virus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
