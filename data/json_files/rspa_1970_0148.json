Topics covered include the harmonic oscillator formalism, factorization properties, Olesen's cure for loop divergence, and the phenomenology of 5-point functions. The author also explores the implications of Veneziano theory on planar duality diagrams and its potential for a complete dual field theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
