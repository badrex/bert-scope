The authors develop equations for heat and mass transfer and explore the effects of the Lewis number and condensation number on aerosol growth. They also consider the conditions under which aerosols will evaporate or not form during cooling processes. The findings have implications for environmental studies and safety in industries such as nuclear power.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
