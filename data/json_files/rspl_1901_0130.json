Bateson regarding the concepts of heredity, differentiation, and evolution. Pearson argues that Bateson's criticism attacks the fundamental ideas of his long series of papers on \"The Mathematical Theory of Evolution.\" Pearson believes that a full discussion of this matter must be long and argumentative, and therefore, he proposes to transfer his reply to another publication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
