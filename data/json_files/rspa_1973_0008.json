By designing a source assembly with a gold-lined collimating cylinder, they significantly increased the yield of low energy positrons. This method allows for the study of positron-atom interactions and the potential for producing a suitable beam of monoenergetic positrons for scattering experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
