The authors found that ethylene, propylene, and butylene can combine with aliphatic alcohols in the presence of a suitable catalyst and high pressure. They determined the equilibrium constants for the system alcohol-olefine-ether and provided a detailed analysis of the experimental procedure and results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
