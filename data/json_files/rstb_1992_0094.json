The results provide strong evidence for a relatively recent age of the human mtDNA ancestor, with estimates ranging from 133 to 137 thousand years ago. This supports the African origin hypothesis of human mtDNA evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
