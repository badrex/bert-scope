The author shares observations of young toads and frogs found in unusual locations, such as cellars and gardens, where the tadpole stage would be impossible. The author suggests that these amphibians may be born alive or develop directly from the egg, challenging the traditional understanding of their reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Herpetology"}
