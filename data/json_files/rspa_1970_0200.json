They measured five sets of frequencies in {100} and {110} planes and interpreted the results based on Mattheiss' augmented plane wave band structure calculation. The findings support the Fermi surface model for transition metals and provide insights into the electronic structure and properties of niobium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
