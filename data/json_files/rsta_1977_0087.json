It discusses the Moon's interior structure, including the crust, upper mantle, middle mantle, lower mantle, and core, and how lunar tides control deep moonquake activity. The study also reveals the presence of active fault segments along moonquake belts and the influence of tidal stresses on moonquakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
