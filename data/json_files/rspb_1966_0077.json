The authors analyze data from the open-field test, which measures emotional elimination and activity in rats. They find that the stability of open-field behavior is influenced by genetic determinants related to dominance, while there is little evidence of interaction with the environment. The study also shows complex relationships between response to test experience and the two aspects of behavior studied, suggesting potential evolutionary significance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
