These moulds were made of smooth, well-cleansed clay and were used for taking impressions of Roman coins. Baker suggests that if these moulds were used with melted metal, it would be an easy and cost-effective method of coin production. The moulds were hard enough to hold their smooth surface, making it difficult to detect counterfeit coins.", "scientific_discipline": "Archaeology > Roman Archaeology"}
