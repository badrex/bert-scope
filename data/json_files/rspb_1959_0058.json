They discovered that when a muscle is stretched during contraction, the chemical products of the reaction can be wholly returned to their initial state. This result depends on the amplitude and timing of the stretch, and the authors propose a thermoelastic heat absorption theory to explain the observed phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
