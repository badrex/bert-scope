The author refutes previous claims that sugar formation only occurs post-mortem and demonstrates that sugar is constantly being formed in the healthy animal body. The experiments involve testing blood and liver samples from animals under various conditions to prove the presence of sugar in the liver during life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
