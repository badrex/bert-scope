They demonstrate that the subdynamics formalism provides the same description of the long-time behavior of ensembles as the canonical non-equilibrium ensemble, and that the decay rates of the eigenvectors of the evolution operator are the same as those given by the resonance theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
