They studied the effects of fiber spacing, orientation, and surface treatment on the fracture energy and cracking resistance of these composites. The results showed that the major factor contributing to the fracture energy of the composite is work done against friction between the fiber and matrix. The authors also found that the fracture energy is controlled by the fiber content, while the critical stress intensity factor is affected separately by fiber spacing and volume fraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
