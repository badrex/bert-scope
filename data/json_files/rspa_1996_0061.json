The research focuses on the mechanical interactions between the mixture's constituents and how these interactions affect the flow's behavior. The findings provide insights into the distribution of sediment in glaciers and ice sheets, which can help improve our understanding of these natural phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics and Geodynamics"}
