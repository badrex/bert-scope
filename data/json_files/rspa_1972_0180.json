They found that chemisorption significantly modifies some Auger transition probabilities involving platinum-valence electrons and observed a net electron transfer from platinum to the ligand in the case of carbon monoxide adsorption. The surface configuration of adsorbed carbon monoxide was defined by a Fourier analysis of the LEED data, revealing both terminal and bridging carbonyl groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
