The research focuses on the transient velocity and temperature profiles, skin friction, and heat transfer rates. The findings show that free convection currents can cause reversed flow types and affect the amplitude and phase of skin friction. The rate of heat transfer increases with greater heating or cooling of the plate, with a higher impact when the plate is cooled.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
