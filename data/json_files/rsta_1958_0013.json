The authors analyze the complex synclinorium, which is composed of Carboniferous Culm Measures and overlain by Permian and later deposits. They interpret the gravity and magnetic anomalies, suggesting that the exposed granites are cupolas on a batholith reaching a depth of at least 8 km. The authors also discuss the possible presence of Coal Measures beneath the Devonian region and the influence of thrusts on the gravity anomalies.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Geophysics"}
