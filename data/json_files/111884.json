The study reveals the unique microstructure of the tooth, which is made up of various calcareous elements and has similarities to the shells of some mollusks. The author also discusses the process of calcification and the role of soldering particles in the formation of the tooth's cavitary structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Echinodermatology"}
