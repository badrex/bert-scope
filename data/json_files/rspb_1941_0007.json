The research concludes that the optical heterogeneity of the wall is not due to changes in cellulose chain direction. Instead, the wall is composed of chains forming a single, steep spiral. The findings support the idea that lignification causes an increase in wall thickness, and the distribution of lignin and pectin in jute fibers is significantly different from that in hemp.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
