They find that these terms contribute to the static dielectric constant and can affect the infra-red absorption spectrum. The study suggests that the long-range dipolar interactions between the first- and second-order moments may be responsible for the variations in the intensity and width of the infra-red bands in ionic crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
