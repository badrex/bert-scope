The authors describe the preparation process and the size-dependent optical properties of these nanoclusters, which are influenced by trapped charge carriers. They also explore the potential applications of these nanoparticles in nonlinear optics, as well as the formation of composite particles and dense nanoparticulate films.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nanotechnology"}
