This table allowed for the representation of nearly all phenomena of mutual action between different salts. The author also observed that there must be a sequence in simple elective attractions and an agreement between simple and double elective attractions. This work enabled the comparison of scattered chemical phenomena and facilitated the understanding of chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
