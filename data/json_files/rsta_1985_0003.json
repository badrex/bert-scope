They found that the presence of 3He significantly influenced the nucleation rate, with the effect becoming more pronounced at lower temperatures and electric fields. The authors proposed a model to explain the observed behavior, which they tested and compared with experimental data. This research provides insights into the microscopic vortex nucleation mechanism and the role of 3He in superfluidity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
