The authors explore the factors that determine these materials' production, such as tensile and elongation properties, molecular mass, and distribution in polymers. They also examine the importance of low molecular mass material in the drawing process and the dynamic mechanical behavior of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Composite Materials"}
