They use a joint evolutionarily stable strategy model to show that male investment in display and female choice for displaying males are evolutionarily stable when the \"good genes\" advantage of female choice outweighs the loss of paternal care. High heritable variation in male genetic quality leads to polygynous mating systems in populations and species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
