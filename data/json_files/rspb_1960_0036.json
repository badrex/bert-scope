They also found a heat-labile, non-dialyzable substance in the moth's abdominal tissues that increases capillary permeability and causes death on intravenous injection. These substances may play a role in the moth's defense mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
