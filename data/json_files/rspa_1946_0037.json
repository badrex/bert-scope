The method involves determining the scattered field by considering a magnetic charge and current sheet over the holes in the screen. This approach can be applied to various diffraction problems, including those involving a narrow slit, a narrow blade, a small circular disk, or a small circular hole.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
