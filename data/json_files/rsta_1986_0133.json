The author reviews various theoretical models, including those influenced by particle physics, to explain the observed patterns of galaxy clustering and the distribution of dark matter. The article highlights the importance of further research to better understand the relationship between galaxies and dark matter, as well as the implications for the overall structure and evolution of the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
