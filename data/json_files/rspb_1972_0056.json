The researchers found that the frequency of five-banded morphs increases from north to south, while mid-banded morphs decrease. The findings suggest that similar selective forces are at play in this region, and further investigation into two unique areas with unusual morph frequencies is conducted to understand the causes behind these patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Biogeography"}
