They introduce wave tensors, which are the product of two -vectors, and explore their properties and applications. The author finds that wave tensors can be replaced by a space vector, a 10-vector, and an invariant in a five-dimensional space, providing a new perspective on wave mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
