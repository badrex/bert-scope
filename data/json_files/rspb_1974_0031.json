After crushing or cutting the pallial nerve, the denervated area initially shows uniform pale grey skin. Over time, the chromatophores regain their ability to expand and form specific patterns, indicating that nerve fibres have remade their original connections. This research provides insight into the mechanisms of nerve regeneration and the control of skin colour patterns in octopuses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
