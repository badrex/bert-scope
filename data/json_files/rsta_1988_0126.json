The authors analyze the metamorphic conditions and tectonic history of various regions, including the Lhasa Terrane, the Kunlun Terrane, and the Qiangtang Terrane. They provide evidence of high-pressure metamorphism during the Eocene subduction and uplift events, as well as the emplacement of various igneous rocks. The study contributes to our understanding of the complex tectonic history of the Tibetan Plateau.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Metamorphism and Tectonics"}
