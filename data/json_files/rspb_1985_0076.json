The authors found that the large T-antigen can activate transcription by RNA polymerase III and regulate the expression of certain genes, including a class I major histocompatibility complex (MHC) gene. This research provides insights into the mechanism by which SV40 transforms cells and contributes to the overall transformed phenotype.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
