These compounds are formed through direct combination with olefines and non-saturated haloid ethers. The author also discusses the properties and reactions of these compounds, such as their sweet and biting taste, and their decomposition when exposed to certain conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
