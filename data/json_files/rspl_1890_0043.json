The author investigates the stability of magnetic groups, the effects of temperature and mechanical forces on magnetic properties, and the role of molecular inertia in magnetic phenomena. The findings provide a deeper understanding of magnetic behavior and contribute to the development of magnetic theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
