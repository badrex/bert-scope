The authors found that the ratio of photosystem II to photosystem I reaction centers varies among different photosynthetic organisms, and that the size of the chlorophyll antenna affects the efficiency of electron flow between the two photosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
