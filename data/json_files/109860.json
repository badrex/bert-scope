The raw materials used are serpentine, magnesian limestone, and pyrites. The ore is extracted, roasted, and then kept moist for several months to form salts. The materials are lixiviated, and the copper and iron are precipitated before adding lime to produce the sulfate of magnesia. The process emphasizes the importance of the proportion of lime used to prevent precipitation of magnesia along with the metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
