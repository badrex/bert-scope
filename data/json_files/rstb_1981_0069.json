The crystal structures of the chicken muscle and yeast enzymes are analyzed, revealing a similar conformation of the polypeptide chain. The active site contains a key glutamic acid residue believed to act as a base in the reaction. Crystallographic studies of the enzyme's binding with dihydroxyacetone phosphate suggest a mechanism involving polarization of the substrate carbonyl group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry", "sub_discipline": "Enzyme Structure and Function"}
