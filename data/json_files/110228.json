He invents a galvanometer that uses a glass filament and a magnetized needle to measure the intensity of the galvanic current. He also proposes improving the sensitivity of the common balance by adding a glass thread to the beam. Glass has perfect elasticity, making it a better material for torsion-based instruments than metallic wires.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
