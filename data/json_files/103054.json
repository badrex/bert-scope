He used a large quadrant and a pendulum clock to measure the eclipse's duration and the Sun's position. Halley noted the change in the sky's color during the eclipse and the appearance of a luminous ring around the Moon. He also recorded the limited visibility of stars during the eclipse and the diffused light in the surrounding atmosphere."}
