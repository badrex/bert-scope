These equations show that Feynman amplitudes propagate in the Feynman manner and can be used to describe the interaction of pseudo-scalar mesons with nucleons. The equations also have implications for the renormalization of the theory and the interpretation of infinities in the kernels of the equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
