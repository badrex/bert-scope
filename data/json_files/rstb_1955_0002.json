They discovered that the wave moves along the helicoidal cross-membranes, suggesting that these membranes may provide the path of conduction. This finding has important implications for understanding muscle fiber contraction and the role of cross-striation in muscle physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
