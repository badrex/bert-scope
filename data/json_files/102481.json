Derham, presents a new method for measuring the height of mercury in a barometer using a circle on a weather plate with a register. This method is more convenient than using a crooked tube and can help measure the variation of mercury on different heights. Derham also shares his weather observations and rain measurements for the year 1697, providing insights into the state of the weather, winds, and rainfall during that time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
