They discovered that applying tension to the steel increased its magnetic intensity and found a correlation between the changes in length and the intensity of magnetization. The study also highlighted the importance of surface conditions and oxidation on the magnetic properties of the steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
