The research shows that rapid alternating stress suppresses widespread disorientation in metal grains, while slow alternating stress causes extensive disorientation. The findings have implications for understanding the failure of metals by fatigue.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fatigue of Materials"}
