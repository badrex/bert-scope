They discovered that about 1 in every 300 tracks showed branching, and the shapes and sizes of the branches were very similar. The authors also found that the branching occurred near the end of the a-ray path and the angle between the branches did not differ much. The nature of these branched tracks remains a topic of speculation and further research is needed to understand the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
