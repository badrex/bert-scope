The results reveal that these particles have a trigonal outline and a plate-like morphology. The presence of twin planes on {111} is confirmed, which explains the formally forbidden |{422} reflections observed in plan view. The study also discusses possible growth mechanisms for these particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
