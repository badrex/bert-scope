Sherrington's research on the brain and nerves provided a new outlook on how sense organs, the brain, and muscles work together to control our movements and maintain balance. His work on feed-back mechanisms, now used in engineering, has had a lasting impact on the field of neuroscience. Sherrington's contributions earned him numerous awards, including the Nobel Prize and membership in the Order of Merit.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Neuroscience"}
