They compared the experimental results with numerical analysis of a thermokinetic model and found that the maximum concentration of hydrogen atoms was reached before the hydroxyl radicals. This study provides insights into the kinetic mechanisms controlling oscillatory oxidation of hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
