The authors develop a general-purpose computer program (SWANDYNE-X) to predict the behavior of saturated geomaterials, such as soils, under various conditions. The results are validated through comparisons with experimental data from physical models tested in the Cambridge Centrifuge. The mathematical framework and numerical approximations used in this study can be applied to various fields, including civil engineering, oil reservoir engineering, hydrology, and bio-engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Mechanics"}
