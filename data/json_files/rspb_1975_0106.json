They discovered the nucleus contains 800-1100 cells distributed about the midline at the ventral surface of the optic tectum. The study provides a description of cellular form, cell distribution, and the principal connections of the nucleus, which is essential for understanding the evolution of this pathway within the vertebrate central nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain anatomy"}
