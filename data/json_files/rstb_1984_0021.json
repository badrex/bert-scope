These patches are regularly spaced and aligned into rows, and are present in layers II and III. The patches receive a direct projection from the lateral geniculate nucleus, and their density and pattern are unique to primate visual cortex. The functional significance of these patches remains uncertain, but they may be related to the organization of hypercolumns in the visual cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Perception"}
