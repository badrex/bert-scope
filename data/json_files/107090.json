The theorem involves integrating over three rectangular coordinates and transforming the expressions to simplify the calculations. This theorem can be used to find the surface area of two cylinders included in a sphere and the length of the curve formed by their intersection.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
