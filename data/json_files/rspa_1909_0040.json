They found that the ionization is proportional to the pressure in the gas, and discussed the factors contributing to the ionization, such as slow-moving ions ejected from gas molecules and secondary cathode rays from the walls of the chamber.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ionization and Radiation"}
