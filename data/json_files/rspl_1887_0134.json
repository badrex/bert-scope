They discuss the significance of the relative positions of these elements and the importance of understanding their development for interpreting the \"receptacular tube\" and the \"inferior ovary.\" The authors also explore the effects of processes like union, separation, and fusion of cords on the formation of floral parts and the phenomena of cohesion and adhesion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
