He used various materials, such as clay, dried clay powder, and brick dust, to test the impact of balls falling from different heights. The results showed that the impressions made in soft bodies were in proportion to the heights from which the balls were dropped, suggesting that the force of percussion depends on the degree of cohesion in the soft bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
