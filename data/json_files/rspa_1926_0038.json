They found that at pressures below 2 atmospheres, the mixtures could not be ignited. At initial pressures between 2.75 and 5 atmospheres, ignition was possible but combustion was not always complete. At pressures of 10 atmospheres or more, the mixture ignited instantly.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
