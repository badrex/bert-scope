The research shows that diphtheria antitoxin prepared in a guinea pig passes easily to the offspring, while the same antitoxin prepared in a horse and subjected to peptic digestion does not. The study also demonstrates that peptic-digested antitoxin loses its ability to cause passive anaphylactic sensitization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
