The camel's second stomach holds water in a pure state, while the first stomach has two compartments with cells that hold water and air. This unique digestive system allows camels to survive longer without drinking water, making them well-suited for life in the desert.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
