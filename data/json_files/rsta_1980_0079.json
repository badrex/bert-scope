It explores the role of residual elements and intentional alloying additions in causing or enhancing liquation effects. The article emphasizes the importance of compositional balance to limit the influence of residuals and avoid liquation cracking. It also reviews the detection, significance, and avoidance of liquation cracking in weldments.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Welding and Materials Failure"}
