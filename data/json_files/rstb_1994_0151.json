The author explains the organization and structure of pathogen recognition loci, the existence of genes expressing different specificities, and the role of interallelic recombination in generating novel recognition capabilities. The article also highlights the importance of understanding these interactions for crop breeding and disease management.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
