The author studies the symmetry and construction of these patterns, focusing on their rotational and reflexive symmetry properties. The article also discusses the Pascal matrix and its eigen-system, as well as the properties and enumeration of the polynomials and sequences formed from its row- and column-eigenvectors.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics"}
