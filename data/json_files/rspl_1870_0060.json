Fritz. Professor Wolf investigates the form of the sunspot curve from one minimum to another, while M. Fritz explores the connection between sunspots, auroral, and magnetic disturbances and their relation to planetary configurations. The studies find that Jupiter has the greatest influence on sunspots, followed by Venus, Mercury, Earth, and Saturn. The authors also mention the possibility of a monthly maximum in sunspot activity due to a particular solar meridian's tendency to spot formations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
