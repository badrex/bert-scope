The authors conducted experiments on copper single crystals, finding that latent hardening is less than active hardening and that the active hardening rate is not constant. The study provides a unique evolution for the active set of slips and predicts behaviors such as stage II rapid hardening and stress-strain curves for various orientations.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
