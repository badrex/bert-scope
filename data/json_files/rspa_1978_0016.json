The author introduces a prong structure to elucidate the properties of these approximants, which satisfy symmetry, projection, reciprocal covariance, and homographic covariance properties. The article focuses on the diagonal quadratic two-variable approximants and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Approximation Theory"}
