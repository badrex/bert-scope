As the temperature drops below 10\u00b0C, the salmon become more nocturnal, hiding during the day and emerging at night to feed. This behavior is linked to changes in the fish's physiology and social structure, which may help maximize feeding efficiency in summer while reducing predation risk in winter.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ethology"}
