The authors describe their approach, which involves measuring ground deformations and using the data to better understand ground behavior, determine parameters for future predictions, and check the design and safety of projects. They provide examples of ground deformation measurements from various civil engineering projects, including a proposed proton accelerator in Norfolk, the Shell Centre in London, and the Britannic House basement excavation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Geotechnical Engineering"}
