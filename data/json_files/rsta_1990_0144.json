The technique provides high chemical specificity and sensitivity, making it useful for studying complex organic molecules at surfaces. The authors demonstrate the power of SSIMS by applying it to four areas of surface investigation, including the adsorption and reaction of propene on a ruthenium single crystal surface, the interaction of organic lubricants with a synthetic 'gold' surface, and the identification of contaminants responsible for adhesive failure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
