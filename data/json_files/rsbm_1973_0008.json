He conducted extensive research on the tree-shrew and the spectral tarsier, which helped advance our understanding of primate evolution. Le Gros Clark also studied the macro- and micro-anatomy of the tree-shrew brain, leading to investigations of the cortical and other connections of the thalamus and lateral geniculate body. His work laid the foundation for further studies on sensory pathways and the connections between the thalamus and the cerebral cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
