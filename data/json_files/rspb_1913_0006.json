The author points out that the previous study's experiments were conducted in a room with stray light, which contaminated the pure spectral colors. By taking stray light into account, the author demonstrates that the results align with Young's theory and can be replicated using pure spectral colors and moderate stimuli.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Color Vision"}
