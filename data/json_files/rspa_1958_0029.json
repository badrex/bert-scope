Two distinct mechanisms operate concurrently, one producing ethylamine and acetaldehyde, and the other diethylamine and acetaldehyde. The latter process becomes self-inhibited as the reaction proceeds. The authors suggest that the first process involves unimolecular decomposition of intermediate peroxy-radicals, while the second reaction proceeds via the formation of corresponding hydroperoxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
