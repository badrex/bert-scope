The spectrum exhibited nine distinct Raman lines with frequency shifts. The observed facts fit into the theoretical picture provided by the dynamics of crystal lattices recently worked out by Sir C. V. Raman. The results showed that the Born lattice dynamics does not correctly picture the vibration spectrum of the rock-salt lattice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
