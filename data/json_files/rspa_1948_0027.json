They discuss the integration of these equations, focusing on the Falkner-Skan equation and its applications in hydrodynamics. The paper also provides a detailed analysis of the behavior of the equations at infinity and the integration process, which is divided into three separate steps.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
