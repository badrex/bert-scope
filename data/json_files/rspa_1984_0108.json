They set up equations for space-times with two space-like Killing-vectors and reduce them to a single Ernst-type equation. The simplest linear solution of the Ernst equation leads to the Nutku-Halil solution, which is further described in a Newman-Penrose formalism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Waves"}
