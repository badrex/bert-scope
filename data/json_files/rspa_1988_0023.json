They use a Bethe tree as the network of pore connections and analyze capillary condensation adsorption and desorption scanning curves. The results provide an estimate of the cavity-size distribution, window-size distribution, and the number of windows per cavity, enabling the calculation of geometric pore sizes from the Kelvin pore sizes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
