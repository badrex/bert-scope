They discover that these filters provide lateral inhibition, spatial and spectral frequency suppression, and demonstrate color constancy. This research contributes to understanding how the human visual system processes color information from natural scenes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Perception"}
