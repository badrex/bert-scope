Everett, conducted extensive observations of atmospheric electricity at King's College from 1862 to 1864. He used a water-dropping method and later burning matches to measure the electricity. The study found that heavy rain, snow, fog, and thunderstorms all have a significant impact on atmospheric electricity. The author also discovered that there is a maximum of atmospheric electricity around sunrise, a minimum between 11 am and 12 pm, and a less marked maximum between 4 pm and 5 pm, followed by a decrease to midnight. This research contributes to the understanding of atmospheric electricity and its relation to weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
