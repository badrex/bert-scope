The authors found that adhesion increases during the latent period when the lubricant is composed of a single pure chemical substance, while it may increase or decrease during this period when the lubricant contains multiple substances. The results suggest that the orderliness of the lubricant's molecular structure plays a crucial role in adhesion, with higher orderliness leading to increased adhesion and decreased friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
