They used a zinc sulphide screen to observe scintillations caused by alpha-particles from pitchblende samples. The results showed that uranium emits a significant number of alpha-particles per second per gram, which is in fair agreement with Rutherford's findings on radium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radioactivity"}
