The authors examine the fit of continental margins, the continuity of geological structures, and the presence of similar sedimentary and petrographic histories in different continents. They also consider the absence of records of marine invasions from the directions of the present adjoining oceans as negative evidence. The authors argue that while no single piece of evidence can prove continental drift, the convergent evidence of many independent facts makes it difficult to explain in any other way.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
