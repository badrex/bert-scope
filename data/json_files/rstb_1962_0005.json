After sectioning the optic nerves, the plexiform layer of the optic lobe becomes reduced, but the tangential layers of dendrites remain. The study provides insights into the coding system of visual input and the complexity of the visual system in cephalopods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
