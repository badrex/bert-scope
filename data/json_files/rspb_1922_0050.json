They observed changes in the cells' cytoplasm, including amoeboid movement and the presence of mitochondria and granules. The author also described the process of mitosis, including the formation of the spindle, chromosome separation, and the appearance of nucleoli in the newly formed cells. These observations provide insights into the mechanisms of cell growth and division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
