Tho. Birch, James Short shares his observations of a comet seen in January 1760. He notes the comet's small nucleus, its motion to the westward, and its lack of a visible tail. Short also provides details of the comet's transit and declination, as well as the position of nearby stars. His observations were made using a two-foot reflector, magnifying about 70 times.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
