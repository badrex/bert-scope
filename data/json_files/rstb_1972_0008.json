The author analyzes the unique method of supporting the quadrate and quadratojugal in whaitsiids, which is different from other therocephalians and synapsids. The study also highlights similarities in the skull structure of whaitsiids and cynodonts, suggesting a possible evolutionary link between the two groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
