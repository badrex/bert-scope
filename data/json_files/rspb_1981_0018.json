The researchers discovered that segmental cutaneous axons are constrained from sprouting into skin occupied by a neighboring segmental nerve, even when that nerve is removed. However, they will sprout readily within the territory of the parent nerve, which the researchers call \"domains.\" The spatial constraint seems to operate at the borders of domains and relates to the limb as a whole rather than the skin itself.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
