Brady, describes the discovery of remarkable insects resembling polypes found in the waters near Brussels. These insects exhibit unique behaviors, such as wheel-like movement and the ability to regenerate. They also interact with a plant that resembles an orange, which has a chain-like structure that moves like the insect's crown. The plant's trunk serves as its gut, and other insects prey on its leaves, causing its withered appearance when dead.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
