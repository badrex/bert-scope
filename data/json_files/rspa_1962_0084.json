This method avoids the need to solve sets of simultaneous linear equations and is suitable for obtaining iterative approximate solutions at low frequencies. The case of an incident plane wave is considered in detail, and expansions in powers of frequency radius are obtained for the respective transmission coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
