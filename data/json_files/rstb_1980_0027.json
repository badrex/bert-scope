The channels filled with sand and gravel are considered to be ancient meanders of an old River Thames. The study of the fauna and flora found in these channels indicate a Cromerian Interglacial period. The Plateau Drift's age, topographical position, pebble content, and heavy mineralogy were examined, leading to conclusions about its origin and correlation with other deposits in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
