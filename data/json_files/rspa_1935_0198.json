They used an improved experimental method to determine the dependence of the absorption coefficient on the wave-length and the atomic number of the absorbing element. The results provide valuable data for applications in radiation measurement and the understanding of photoelectric absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
