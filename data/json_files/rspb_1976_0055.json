They found evidence for sexual dimorphism and synaptic convergence in these areas, specifically in neurones projecting to the region of the median eminence. The results showed that many adjacent preoptic/anterior hypothalamic neurones received convergent synaptic inputs from both the mediobasal hypothalamus and the corticomedial amygdala.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
