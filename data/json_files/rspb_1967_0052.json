It demonstrates the extensive blood supply to the synaptic areas in the optic lobe, which is correlated with previous findings that integrated visual reflexes fail shortly after interrupting the blood supply. The research reveals the organization of the blood capillary system within the central nervous system and its relationship with synaptic areas in the structured neuropile of the optic lobes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy and Circulatory System"}
