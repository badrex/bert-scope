The research shows that the effects of these polymorphisms on survival are independent, and the level of overcompensatory mortality, responsible for population instability, is higher after accounting for genetic variation in coat and horn traits. This emphasizes the importance of understanding the interaction between selection and population demography for both genetic and ecological studies of natural populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
