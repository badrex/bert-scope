They observed that faulted dislocation loops can be nucleated and grown in thin foils made from quenched specimens, and analyzed the kinetics of climb to determine the stacking fault energy. This research contributes to understanding the properties and behavior of these materials under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
