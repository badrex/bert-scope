They propose a new approach to significance testing and introduce a weighted mean of true values as a fundamental unknown in the comparison of series of measures. This new approach helps to assess the significance of one new parameter when there is an additional parameter whose significance is not in question.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics"}
