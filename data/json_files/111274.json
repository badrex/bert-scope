The results showed that gravity below the surface is greater than above by 0.8 parts, with an uncertainty of 0.5 parts of the excess. The mean density of the Earth was calculated to be 26,266, which the author believes may compete on equal terms with previous experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
