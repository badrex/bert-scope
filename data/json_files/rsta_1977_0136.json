The microscope, combined with an energy-dispersive X-ray analysis system, allows for the rapid analysis of dust particles, providing information on their size, shape, and chemical composition. This technique is useful in understanding the environmental and health impacts of mineral dust exposure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Mineralogy"}
