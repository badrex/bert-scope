The research explores how this threshold varies with different wavelengths of light and under various conditions of adaptation. The findings reveal unique characteristics in the brightness increment at specific wavelengths, which may be connected to the three mechanisms postulated by the trichromacy theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Visual Perception"}
