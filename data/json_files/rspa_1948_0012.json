They found that the Houwink equation with an exponent of approximately 3.4 accurately describes the relationship. This method can be used to calculate the number-average degree of polymerization and molecular weight distribution in unfractionated polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
