They combine nonlinear internal model control (1MC) with an adaptive controller to improve performance and maintain stability in the presence of multistationarity and unstable solutions. This approach demonstrates excellent servo and regulatory control capabilities, even with deterministic and stochastic disturbances and modeling errors.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Control Systems"}
