The ordered water channel model is used, which consists of an array of water rings lining a channel spanned by protein rod structures. The channel's electrostatic potential gradient is calculated, and the current-voltage characteristics are compared with the known characteristics of sodium and potassium channels in squid giant axons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Membrane Biology"}
