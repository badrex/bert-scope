The authors analyze the advantage obtained by a choosing female and show that slow, simultaneous host-parasite cycles can create a permanent source of heritable variance, allowing for mate choice to influence offspring fitness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
