The author compares the non-periodic and periodic temperature changes, analyzing the data collected at the Magnetical and Meteorological Observatory. The study provides insights into the mean temperature at different hours and days of the year, and discusses the use of Chrono-Isothermal Lines to represent temperature phenomena. The author also highlights the abnormal winter temperatures in North America and compares the findings with other parts of the globe.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
