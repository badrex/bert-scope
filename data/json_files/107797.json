The instrument consists of a mercurial thermometer with a special bulb and a bottle of ether. By placing the ether bottle's mouth in contact with the upper part of the covered bulb, the ether flows downwards, allowing the deposition of moisture on the bulb's surface. This method enables the observer to determine the instant at which moisture condensation begins and the degree of temperature at which it occurs. The instrument's design allows for easy and accurate measurements of atmospheric phenomena."}
