The algae were found in 23 out of 27 sites, with the deposits containing about 1% of their dry mass as Cyanophyta. The authors discovered that the algae's assimilation rates were low, and their contribution to carbonate deposition was minimal. The study also examined the distribution, growth characteristics, and photosynthesis of the blue-green algae in relation to the carbonate deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
