They prove that the partition is specified by a boundary curve and discuss the implications for three-dimensional crown shapes. The results apply to various shapes, including spheres and more general forms, and generate partitions of space, providing a simpler prescription for \"growing space.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
