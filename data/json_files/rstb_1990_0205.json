The research shows that females of both subspecies prefer the songs and plumage characteristics of males from their own subspecies, leading to assortative mating. Early rearing experience and sexual imprinting play a role in mate choice and subspecies recognition, ensuring behavioral isolation between the two subspecies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ethology and Animal Behavior"}
