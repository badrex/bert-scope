The research measures currents, wind directions, and temperature variations to understand the dynamics of the loch and the impact of local mixing on the water's properties. The findings provide insights into the complex interactions between wind, water, and geophysical processes in lochs.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
