They discuss Kolmogorov's similarity theory and its modifications, and assess the relevant experimental evidence. The study focuses on the scaling properties of the fluctuating scalar field and the energy dissipation rate in high-Reynolds-number turbulent flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
