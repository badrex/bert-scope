The author discovers that the hardness of these metals is due to the development of a structure where distorted crystalline units are cemented together by a portion of the metal that has momentarily flowed around them. The study also examines the effects of heat on the crystalline structure of these metals, revealing that the changes in structure occur at relatively low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallurgy"}
