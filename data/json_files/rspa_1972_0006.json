They find that gas phase reactions play a significant role in the process, and the kinetics of the reaction cannot be explained solely by gas-solid reactions. The study provides insights into the complex interactions between gas and gas-solid processes in catalytic reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
