They confirm Nassonov's findings that the secretion is cytoplasmic in origin and elaborate on the different types of secretions and their formation. The study also examines nucleolar extrusions and the formation of secondary nuclei in the epididymis cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
