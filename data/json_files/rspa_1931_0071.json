They used a method involving the separation and measurement of alpha particles emitted by the decay of Uranium II. The results provided a more accurate understanding of the relationships between radioactive elements in Uranium and improved the measurement of half-life.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
