It discusses the implications of selection on quantitative traits and provides a model for the change in the mean of a population under selection. The author also explores the effects of age structure and reproductive success on selection and offers insights into the dynamics of evolutionary processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
