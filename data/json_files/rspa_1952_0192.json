The author explains how the probability distribution for the coordinates and momenta of molecules can be used to derive transport coefficients like viscosity and thermal conductivity. The theory is applied to monatomic liquids and electrolytes, providing a better understanding of their behavior and properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
