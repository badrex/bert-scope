They analyzed the energy levels, rotational constants, and molecular constants of these molecules, providing insights into their electronic transitions and molecular structures. This research contributed to the understanding of the behavior of these molecules and their applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
