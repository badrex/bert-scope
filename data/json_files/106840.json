A man was struck and killed by lightning while seeking shelter under an oak tree. The lightning also fused quartzose matter in the soil, creating a melted area around the tree. The author discusses the intense heat required to cause this fusion and suggests that further digging may reveal more melted substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
