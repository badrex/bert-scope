The satellite's hard-ray telescope and high dispersion soft-ray crystal spectrometer provided valuable insights into the location and behavior of high-energy particles during solar flares, leading to a better understanding of the solar atmosphere and the processes occurring within it.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
