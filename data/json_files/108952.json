He found that some nebulae have continuous spectra, while others have spectra with one, two, or three bright lines. By comparing these spectra with known spectra of elements like nitrogen, hydrogen, and barium, Huggins concluded that some nebulae have a gaseous constitution. This research helped in understanding the nature of nebulae and their relation to other celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
