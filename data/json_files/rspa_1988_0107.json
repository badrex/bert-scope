They focus on the 2-adic contribution to the mass and provide a reliable method for evaluating it. The mass formula is used to check the enumeration of lattices of determinant given in the first paper in this series and to provide tables of the standard mass, the -series (odd), and genera of lattices of determinant 1.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
