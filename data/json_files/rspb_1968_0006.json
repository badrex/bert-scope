The research shows that the cyst wall and the cuticle play a crucial role in reducing water loss and maintaining the viability of the nematodes during desiccation. The findings provide insights into the survival strategies of these organisms and their potential applications in agriculture and environmental management.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
