They identify the existence of trapped modes as a consequence of the gates' articulated construction and show that subharmonic resonance can occur due to normally incident waves. The authors provide a new inviscid theory of trapped modes and present experimental evidence confirming the natural frequency predicted by the theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
