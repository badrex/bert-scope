The authors focus on the prolamin storage proteins, which account for 50% of the seed proteins, and their encoding genes. They also explore the tissue-specific and developmental regulation of these genes, as well as the impact of plant nutrition on their expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Genetics"}
