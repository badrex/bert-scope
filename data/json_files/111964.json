They describe the process of muscle fiber formation, starting from the initial stage of nucleated blastema to the final stage of fully developed fibers. The author also discusses the differences in development between humans and other animals and refutes the cellular theory of Schwann.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
