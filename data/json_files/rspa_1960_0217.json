The positions and intensities of the anomalous maxima are explained using classical diffraction theory, without making assumptions about atomic arrangements. The study covers a range of compositions between anorthite and albite, providing insights into the structure and properties of these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
