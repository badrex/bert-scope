They found that the pig's metabolism continued to descend for 80-100 hours after consuming food. The authors observed variations in the path the metabolism took to reach its basal value and noted that the maximum assimilatory activity was reached 5 hours after ingesting food. This research provides valuable insights into the nutritional requirements for pig growth and overall metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Nutrition"}
