The authors describe the main characteristics of the major deformation, including the distribution of elementary modes of deformation, the geometry of folding, and the orientation of principal strain axes. They also analyze the effects of tectonics on adjacent regions, such as the Aquitanian platform, which can be observed up to 400 km away from the chain. The study provides insights into the overall geometry of the Pyrenees and its implications for understanding the chain's formation and deformation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
