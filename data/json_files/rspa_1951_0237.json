It is found that adaptation is a response by the bulk of the population, not due to a selection of variant cells. The absolute ability to utilize galactose segregates as though controlled by a single gene, but segregants with galactose metabolism exhibit varying degrees of training.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
