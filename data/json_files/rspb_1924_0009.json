They found that the pigment in Arenicola blood is in solution and not in corpuscles, and its oxygen affinity is different from human blood. The study also revealed that the a-band of Arenicola blood is less displaced by carbon monoxide than human blood hemoglobin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Biology"}
