Ten distinct categories of vocalizations are identified and analyzed in relation to their behavioral contexts. The research highlights the importance of vocalizations in communication between individuals, particularly in maintaining contact between mated pairs and defending territories. The findings contribute to our understanding of avian communication and behavioral ecology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
