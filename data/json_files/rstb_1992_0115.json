It presents methods for extracting globally salient structures from an image based on geometrical attributes and using linear combinations of two-dimensional object views for recognition. The focus is on bottom-up processes and manipulation of two-dimensional images, without the use of explicit three-dimensional models.", "scientific_discipline": "Computer Science > Computer Vision"}
