IFS measures the temporal fluctuations in the intensity of scattered laser light, providing insights into the behavior of particles in a fluid medium. The authors review the principles and methods of IFS and apply it to the study of Brownian motion, focusing on the velocity autocorrelation function of a single particle and related quantities. They also explore the effects of particle interactions and the role of long-time tails in the decay of the autocorrelation function.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
