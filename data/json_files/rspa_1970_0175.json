They analyzed the results using phenomenological models involving interactions between rigid molecules and found that both first and second nearest-neighbor interactions are necessary for an adequate description. The study provides insights into the intermolecular dynamics and force constants of hexamethylenetetramine.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
