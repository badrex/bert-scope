It shows that a severe graft-versus-host reaction can depress the host's immunological reactivity, while foreign cells can enable the host to muster a variety of immunological reactions. The research also demonstrates the impact of graft-versus-host reaction on the capacity of mice to react to skin grafts and form antibodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
