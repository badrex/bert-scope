The authors found that the experimental results agree well with the analytical solution for a straight tube by Aris. The presence of bends and constrictions affects the dispersion coefficient, and the data provide a simple and accurate way to study diffusion in gas mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
