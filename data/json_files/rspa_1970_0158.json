The author demonstrates the procedure by considering the propagator for dynamical systems in spherical polar coordinates, providing a modified form of previous results obtained by other researchers. The article also outlines the representation of operators and the integration measure in curvilinear coordinates, with a focus on spherical polar coordinates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
