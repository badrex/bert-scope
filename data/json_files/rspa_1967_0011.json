They used a combination of experimental techniques and numerical calculations to determine the molecular parameters and rotational constants of the ground and excited states. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of phosphine and its electronic transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular spectroscopy"}
