He found that Sirius, a star, has light intensity one to twenty thousand millions less than the sun. He also estimated the distance at which the sun would need to be viewed to match Sirius' brightness and calculated the parallax of the star.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Stellar Parallax"}
