The authors argue that the Troodos Massif represents a slice of oceanic crust and uppermost mantle, formed through sea-floor spreading. They analyze the complex's three main units: Pillow Lava, Sheeted Complex, and Plutonic Complex, and provide evidence for their origin and geological significance.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Ophiolites and Oceanic Crust"}
