They discuss the mathematical structure of the equations and analyze the BB isotherms, showing that they have different properties compared to the Langmuir isotherms. The author also explains the existence of the -transformation in terms of the coalescence of Riemann invariants and presents computed development graphs for both types of isotherms.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
