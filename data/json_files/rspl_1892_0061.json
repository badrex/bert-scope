The author describes the structure of the epistome, collar region, and trunk, and compares it to other organisms like Balanoglossus and Phalodiscus. The study reveals similarities and differences, ultimately confirming Rhabdopleura as a third member of Bateson's order, Hemichordata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
