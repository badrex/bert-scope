They found that the ball takes up an eccentric position in the tube, which requires a particular velocity of rotation. The eccentricity corresponding to minimum energy dissipation for a given velocity of descent is determined, and experiments were conducted to verify the prediction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
