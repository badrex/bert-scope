The authors use slender body theory, periodic boxes, and the periodic solution to Laplace's equation to develop a set of integral equations that are numerically solved. The study considers fibre-fibre interactions and is valid for suspension concentrations up to the semi-dilute regime and for various fibre shapes, including blunt-ended bodies. The results show that fibre-fibre interactions enhance the effective conductivity beyond dilute theory predictions at suspension concentrations of up to a certain threshold. The study also provides a direct verification of the semi-dilute theories of Shaqfeh and Fredrickson, demonstrating the scaling behavior of suspensions of cylinders and spheroids."}
