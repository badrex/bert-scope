He discovers that sub-borate of soda (borax) is effective in dissolving corundum, and provides a detailed account of his experimental process and results. The analysis reveals the composition of corundum, including silica and alumina, and sheds light on the differences in color and properties of various types of corundum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
