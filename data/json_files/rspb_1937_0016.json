This method can detect small amounts of oily contamination and estimate the surface tension of various water surfaces, including sea and inland waters. The study shows that open-sea water is generally clean, while creeks, small harbors, and confined water areas may have lower surface tension due to contamination.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Water Chemistry"}
