The authors found that the molecular refractivity of lithium chloride remains constant in both solvents, while the partial molar volume changes with the composition of the solvent. The results suggest that the variation in molecular refractivity and partial molar volume can provide insights into the composition of the solvent and the behavior of ions in solution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
