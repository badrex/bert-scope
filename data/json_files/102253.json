He details the procedure, including the incision, separation of the caecum from the ileum, and suturing the wound. The bitch recovered well and had a successful pregnancy after the operation, suggesting that the caecum may not be essential for the animal's health.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Veterinary Medicine"}
