They demonstrate that there exists an infinite number of distinct excited state wave functions and provide numerical solutions for various values, contributing to the understanding of atomic energy levels and the behavior of the hydrogen ion in the Hartree approximation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
