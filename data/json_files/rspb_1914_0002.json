They found that the length of the spindle is a constant at the conclusion of the primary spermatocyte metaphase and the ratio between spindle lengths is approximately the same in the spermatocytes of Helix pomatia, Forficula auricularia, and humans. This suggests a possible connection between spindle length and cell volume in the metaphase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
