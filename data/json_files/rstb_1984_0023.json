They are synthesized and accumulated within the developing seed without being subjected to the normal breakdown and re-synthesis cycle. The storage proteins are sequestered in protein bodies, where they are protected from proteinases. During germination, these proteins are broken down to release their constituent amino acids. The storage protein fraction can be modified through changes in the amino acid composition, introducing genes from other species, or enhancing the proportion of desirable component polypeptides.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
