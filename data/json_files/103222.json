He discovered that blood can be pushed out of the vessels during death, especially in cases of hanging or strangulation, and this can cause blood to be found outside the intestines. This observation led him to believe that bleeding might be necessary in cases of sudden fright or sorrow to allow for proper blood circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
