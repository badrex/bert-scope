They discover that the tension of a composite surface composed of two fluids depends on the thickness of the layers and the range of molecular action. The author also examines the spreading of fluids on surfaces and the formation of lenses, providing insights into the limitations of existing theories of capillarity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
