They argue that the motion of air in cyclones is not the motion of revolving fluid in the special sense referred to, and that cyclonic motion is not a symmetrical motion around a center. The author also discusses the dynamics of cyclonic depressions and the balance of pressure and wind velocity in cyclones.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
