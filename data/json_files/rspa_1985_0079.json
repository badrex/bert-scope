The researchers used flow visualization techniques to observe the effects of Reynolds numbers on the boundary layer. They found that the boundary layer remains laminar below a Reynolds number of about 10^5 and becomes turbulent with further increases in Reynolds numbers. The flow relaminarizes as it is advected radially inward by the radial pressure gradient associated with the outer flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
