It explains how these pathways contribute to the sensory-discriminative and motivational-affective components of pain, and how they may vary between different species. The article also explores other somatosensory pathways that may be involved in nociception, such as the spinocervical and postsynaptic dorsal column tracts.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Pain and Nociception"}
