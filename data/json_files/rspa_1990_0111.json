They use a resurgence formula to systematically reduce the exponentially small remainder and create a nested sequence of asymptotic series. This technique is particularly useful for approximating solutions of the one-dimensional Helmholtz equation and can lead to ultimate approximations with errors smaller than the square of the original superasymptotic remainder.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Asymptotic Expansions"}
