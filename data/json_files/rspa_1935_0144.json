They measured the viscosity of thin liquid films enclosed between flat polished surfaces and found that films of liquid crystals possess a high rigidity, while normal liquids do not show signs of induced structure even with very thin films and at temperatures near the freezing point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
