The authors replace the continuous distribution of vorticity with isolated vortices along the trace of the surface and follow their paths using a step-by-step numerical method. The results show that the effect of instability on a surface of discontinuity is to produce concentrations of vorticity at equal intervals along the surface, leading to the formation of vortices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
