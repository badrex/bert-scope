The author investigates the effects of these storms on Earth's magnetic field and discusses the possible causes, such as solar activity. The study reveals that the disturbances are not caused by definite galvanic currents or magnets but may be due to currents in a \"magnetic ether\" near the Earth, influenced by the sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Magnetism and Geophysics"}
