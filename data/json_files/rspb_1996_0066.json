By keeping prepared viable ejaculate in hemipenis pouches, small males can quickly fertilize females even when disturbed by rival males. This tactic increases their mating success and demonstrates an adaptive advantage in dealing with size-dominance hierarchies and sexual interference.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior and Evolution"}
