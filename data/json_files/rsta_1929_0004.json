A. Gaunt and R. H. Fowler, explore the triplets of helium and the spin effects in atomic physics using Dirac's recent theory. They calculate spin separations and wave-functions, finding results that agree with experimental data. The study focuses on the interactions between electrons in helium atoms and the impact of spin on these interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
