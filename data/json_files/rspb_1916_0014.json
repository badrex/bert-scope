The author suggests that color perception is based on the interaction of three different types of photoreceptor cells in the eye, each sensitive to different wavelengths of light. This theory helps explain how we perceive colors and how color vision can be affected by various factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Physiology"}
