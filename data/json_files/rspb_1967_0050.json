Decentralization causes a 40% increase in the noradrenaline content of the spleen, but the proportion of the transmitter released by nerve stimulation remains the same as in a normal spleen. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms of noradrenaline storage and release in the spleen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurotransmitter Release"}
