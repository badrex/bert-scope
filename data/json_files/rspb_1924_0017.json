The results show that there is an axial gradient of oxygen consumption in both organisms, with the head region consuming more oxygen than the tail region. This study provides insights into the metabolic differences between various parts of developing organisms and the role of oxygen consumption in their growth and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
