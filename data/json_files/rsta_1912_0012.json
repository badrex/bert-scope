The author applies advanced mathematical methods to the elastic-sphere theory, deriving expressions for viscosity, diffusivity, and conductivity without assuming any specific properties of the molecules other than their symmetry. The findings contribute to a better understanding of gaseous phenomena and the behavior of molecules in a gas."}
