They calculate the cross sections for scattering and provide a detailed analysis of the angular distribution of scattered electrons. The results are compared with experimental data for hydrogen and helium, showing good agreement for the main features of the scattering process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
