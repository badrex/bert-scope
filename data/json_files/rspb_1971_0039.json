It reviews the data on acute and chronic irradiation effects on marine species and predicts that current waste disposal practices are unlikely to have observable effects on the environment. However, the author emphasizes the need for further research to identify more sensitive indicators of damage at individual and population levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
