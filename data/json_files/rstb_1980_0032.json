The sequence of till, lake clays, compressed wood, and moss peats and peaty silts is found in a small, closed basin cut deeply into the Jurassic bedrock. Pollen and plant macrofossil analyses provide a long and continuous record of vegetational and environmental history at the site, dating the deposits to the Last (Ipswichian) Interglacial and early Devensian Glacial stages. The study adds to the understanding of vegetational and environmental history during the Late Pleistocene and helps in reconstructing local changes in vegetation and environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Stratigraphy"}
