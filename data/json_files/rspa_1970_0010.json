The researchers found that the heat of adsorption varies depending on the surface coverage and temperature. At 86K, the heat of adsorption shows a linear relationship with surface coverage, while at 279K, the heat of adsorption has a stepwise character. The results suggest that nickel surfaces behave as a homogeneous set of localized sites, offering insights into the energetics of adsorbed hydrogen films.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
