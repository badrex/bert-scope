Two main types of neurons, pyramidal and non-pyramidal, are distinguished based on their structure and function. The research also explores the synaptic relationships between these neurons and the different types of axon terminals, providing insights into the functional implications of these connections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
