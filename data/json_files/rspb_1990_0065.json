The researchers found that HBxAg can increase the expression of HBsAg in transfected hepatoma cells, suggesting that this activity in vivo may contribute to the high level of HBsAg expression observed during natural infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
