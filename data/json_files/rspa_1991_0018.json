They re-examine the problem in light of new numerical evidence and suggest that the cause of the discrepancy lies in the use of only the first 12 terms in the Stokes series. The authors' numerical calculations show that the friction factor ratio varies as the square root of the Dean number at high Dean numbers, resolving the paradox.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
