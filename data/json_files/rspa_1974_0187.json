The authors calculate the positions and g-factors of twelve KI configurations and compare their results with previous observations. The study provides a more detailed theoretical interpretation of the KI energy level spectrum, including the effects of configuration mixing.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Physics"}
