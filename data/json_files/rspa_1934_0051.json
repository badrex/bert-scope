The authors found that the steady surface potential, in contact with a gas, was within the limits of experimental error, equal to the gaseous pressure between 100 mm and atmospheric pressure. The rates of charging up, as expressed by the surface potential, were recorded for different temperatures and gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
