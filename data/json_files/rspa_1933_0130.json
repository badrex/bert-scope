They find that a large proportion of deposited atoms are re-emitted as ions, and that the metal ions migrate over the crystal surfaces. The study provides insights into the emission process and the factors affecting it, such as temperature and the amount of metal deposited.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
