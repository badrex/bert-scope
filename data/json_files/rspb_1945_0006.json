The research shows that parental feeding affects the rate of development and mortality of offspring, and this effect can be inherited. The findings suggest that the nutritional effect of parental feeding is transmitted from one generation to another, which has not been recorded before in similar studies on Tribolium confusum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
