It shows that while retinoic acid can maintain life, growth, and general health, it does not support reproduction as effectively as retinol. The research highlights the importance of vitamin A's specific role in reproduction and its three dissociable modes of action: systemic, vision, and reproductive functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
