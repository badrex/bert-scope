They found that the central field approximation, which treats the molecule as a single entity, is a good approximation for these molecules. However, the method fails to predict a stable bound state for silane, and there is still a discrepancy between the calculated and experimental bond lengths. The authors suggest that further improvements may be needed in the central field approximation or the molecular orbital method itself.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
