He explains the role of the Moon's perigee and apogee in tidal variations and how these factors contribute to the complexity of tidal patterns. Wallis also touches upon the annual period of tides and the influence of the Earth's eccentricity and the obliquity of the Zodiac.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
