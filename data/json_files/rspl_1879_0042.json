They found that increased heat reduces carbonic acid production, while increased light, especially violet and blue light, promotes it. The author concludes that more research is needed to understand the impact of tropical climates on human body combustion and respiration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
