The experiments show that the force required to turn the inner cylinder is proportional to the velocity and the square of the velocity, with the latter being a small component. The results agree closely with Poiseuille's experiments on the flow of liquids through capillary tubes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
