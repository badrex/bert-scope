They found that the probability of interaction between a neutron and an electron is not much greater than 1% of the probability of interaction between a neutron and a nitrogen nucleus. The results provide insights into the nature of neutron-induced electron recoils and contribute to the understanding of nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
