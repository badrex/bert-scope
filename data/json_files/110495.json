He also focused on verifying the accuracy of thermometers used in these studies. Forbes collected data on the mineral springs' geological positions, temperatures, and surrounding circumstances. He extended his research to hot springs in other parts of Europe, such as France, Germany, Switzerland, and Italy. The study aimed to establish a basis for understanding the origins and variations of hot springs and their connection to the Earth's interior.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geothermal energy"}
