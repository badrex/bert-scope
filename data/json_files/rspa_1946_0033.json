They develop a self-consistent treatment of diffusion that accounts for various meteorological phenomena, such as water vapor distribution and smoke diffusion near the ground. This method offers a profitable approach to complex diffusion problems near the Earth's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
