The author uses a magnetic balance to measure the magnetic properties of various manganese samples, including powdered and cast forms. The research also explores the effects of heating, temperature, and sample size on the magnetic properties of manganese steels. The findings contribute to the understanding of the magnetic behavior of manganese and its alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
