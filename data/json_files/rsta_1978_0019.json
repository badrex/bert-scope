The authors generalize Lighthill's acoustic analogy and prove that the jet noise problem can be modeled exactly by equivalent sources near a vortex sheet. They also examine the case of a round jet and discuss the amplification of the quadrupole field when the mean jet density is much lower than that of its environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
