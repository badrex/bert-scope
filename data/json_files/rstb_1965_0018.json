It examines the morphology and ultrastructure of the neuro-intermediate lobe, revealing that neurosecretory fibers innervate the intrinsic secretory cells, suggesting a dual control mechanism involving both type A and type B neurosecretory fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Endocrinology"}
