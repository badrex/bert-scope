The authors discovered that iron and aluminum form a strong bond with glass through an intermediate oxide layer, while gold is held by weaker van der Waals forces. The research also explores the role of residual oxygen concentration and the film's structure in the adhesion process.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Surface Chemistry"}
