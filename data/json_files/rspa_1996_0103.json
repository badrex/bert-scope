The authors conducted plate impact experiments and found that the glass exhibits a typical elasto-plastic Hugoniot curve. The material shows a lower dynamic compressive strength compared to other glasses and a distinct precursor decay. The failure process appears to be separate from the Hugoniot elastic limit, which is attributed to a fracture criterion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
