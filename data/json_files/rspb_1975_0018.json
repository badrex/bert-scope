The author found that dimorphic plants have different wall structures in their papillae, which play a role in the incompatibility mechanism. Incompatible pollen grains fail to germinate on the stigmas, while compatible pollen grains successfully germinate and fertilize the plant.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
