They find that a non-linear drag law, where the drag is proportional to the square of the relative velocity, leads to stable particle trajectories in certain ranges of frequency and amplitude. The study applies stability criteria to bubble-liquid systems, liquid drop systems, and solid-liquid systems, demonstrating the agreement between theoretical and observed frequencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
