The study demonstrates that honeybees balance the speeds of retinal images on their two eyes to maintain equidistance and navigate through various environments. The findings suggest that the honeybee's visual system can compute the apparent angular speed of a pattern independently of its contrast or spatial-frequency content.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
