It explores various aspects of the problem, including the large-time behavior, the role of similarity solutions, and the influence of different parameters. The study provides descriptions of the intermediate asymptotic behavior of solutions to the given equations and has practical implications for determining values from experimental observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mathematical Analysis", "sub_discipline": "Applied Mathematics > Partial Differential Equations"}
