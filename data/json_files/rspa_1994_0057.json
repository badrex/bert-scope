The proof assumes the conservation laws for linear and angular momentum and demonstrates that the worldlines of individual particles are straight when there is no interaction. The author provides separate proofs for one, two, three, and four particles, with the proof for four particles being stronger than the others.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
