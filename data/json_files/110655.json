The results showed that the quantity of ashes obtained was significantly higher than the previous quantity. The author suggests that this finding may be connected to the decomposition of other vegetable matter and plant growth. Further research is needed to understand the formation of animal bones through the action of their organization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Action and Plant Growth"}
