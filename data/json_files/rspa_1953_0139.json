The author demonstrates how the dispersion is affected by convection and molecular diffusion, and provides equations to calculate the dispersion along the tube. The findings can be useful for measuring molecular diffusion coefficients and understanding the dispersion of soluble salts in blood vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
