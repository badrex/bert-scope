They used a new tube design and various photographic plates to capture the spectrum at different intensities. The results were analyzed to correct for developer effects and provide accurate measurements of the intensities and wave-lengths of the lines. This research contributes to the understanding of the secondary spectrum and the classification of its lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
