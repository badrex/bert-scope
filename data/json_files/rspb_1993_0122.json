The research finds that the total number of bacteria is larger in embryos than in maternal tissues, and their density is higher in embryos. The growth and division of bacteria in maternal tissues vary with aphid developmental age, suggesting a restriction of bacterial division rates in fourth-instar larvae. The findings have implications for understanding the nutritional interactions between the bacteria and aphid tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
