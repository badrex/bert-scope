They found that the even-parity levels of these nuclei can be understood in terms of single-particle levels with a large spin-orbit splitting. The mode of coupling is closer to -coupling than to jj-coupling, and the calculations suggest that both configurational mixing and intermediate coupling are essential for a proper understanding of these nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
