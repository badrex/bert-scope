They considered both exchange and polarization effects and compared their results with direct numerical integrations. The study found that variational methods provide satisfactory results for the phase parameters describing the elastic scattering of particles by a center of force, even when using simple trial functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
