They found that the population of each level closely follows the adjacent level, and the main visible emission in the nitrogen afterglow is the first positive system coming from levels. The results confirm the previous deduction that the state is populated by collision-induced transitions from the state.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
