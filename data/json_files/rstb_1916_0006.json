They discovered that the axial extracardial curves provide a more accurate representation of the heart's activities compared to direct base-apex leads. The study emphasizes the importance of understanding the differences between extrinsic and intrinsic effects in interpreting electrocardiograms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
