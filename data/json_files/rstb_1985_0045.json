The researchers found that VIP is present in pelvic nerve afferent fibers, with a significant portion of VIP originating from ganglionic cells at the base of the bladder. These findings suggest that VIP may play a role in the modulation of pain and nociception.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
