By using a slow compression rate and adding small amounts of nitrogen to the oxygen-helium mixture, divers can safely reach depths of up to 686 meters. This technique requires careful selection of divers and the use of 5-8% nitrogen in the Heliox mixture.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
