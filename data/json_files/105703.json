He mentions that the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer dropped to four degrees below zero, which is fifteen degrees below Reaumur's scale. This cold intensity was only slightly more than the cold in 1740. Pallas also notes that the barometer reached a height of 30 1, a record never observed in Berlin before.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Meteorology"}
