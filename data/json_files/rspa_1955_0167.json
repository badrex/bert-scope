The experiments confirm the theoretical predictions for the onset of instability and provide insights into geophysical and astrophysical rotating systems. The results show that over-stable oscillations occur in mercury, which could be relevant to phenomena like the atmospheric index cycle.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
