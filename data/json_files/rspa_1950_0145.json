They studied the field-dependence of the adiabatic susceptibility and determined the entropy and magnetic susceptibility as functions of the absolute temperature. The results showed that the specific heat followed a Curie-Weiss law, with deviations in a ferromagnetic direction for copper potassium sulphate below 1K.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
