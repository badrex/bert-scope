They found that the ionization in diatomic gases is less than in monatomic gases, indicating that energy is expended in other ways. The results provide insights into the behavior of alpha-particles in different gases and contribute to the understanding of the atomic stopping power.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
