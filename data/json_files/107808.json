He explains the differences in density and temperature in various layers of the atmosphere and how gases diffuse through each other. The study of gas diffusion and distribution is essential for understanding the composition and behavior of the Earth's atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Science"}
