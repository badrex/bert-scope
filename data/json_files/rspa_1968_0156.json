They measured the interactions of the center electron with the four nearest fluorine shells and found that the hyperfine interaction with fluorines shows an unusual feature of increasing from one fluoride to another. The results provide useful pointers for further developments of color center theory and help to understand the anisotropic admixture in the ground state wavefunction of the center electron.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
