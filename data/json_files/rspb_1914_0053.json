They discovered that during inspiration, the electrical axis of the heart shifts, causing changes in the amplitude of the electrical pulse. This phenomenon is crucial for understanding the physiological and pathological variations in the electrocardiogram.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
