The researchers used a controlled glass and metal apparatus to study the formation of ion clusters in inert gases with water vapor as the polar impurity. The results provide insights into the behavior of alkali ions and the growth of clusters in different gas environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas-phase chemistry"}
