They used a combination of physiological and histological methods to determine the dendritic trees of these cells and their stratification within the inner plexiform layer. The study found that all on-centre units were inner alpha cells, and all off-centre units were outer alpha cells, providing insights into the on-off dichotomy of retinal ganglion cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
