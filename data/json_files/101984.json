Grew raises a question about the diet of the hummingbird, as it was believed to feed on flower nectar. He suggests that the bird might feed on small insects, similar to other birds. Grew proposes that the bird's anatomy should be studied to determine if it has the same stomach and gut structure as other birds, which would indicate a diet of solid food, or if it has specialized organs for consuming liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Ornithology"}
