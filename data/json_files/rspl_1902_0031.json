They determined the convergence points of the subordinate series and analyzed the differences between the doublets in the spectra. The results showed that the differences between the convergence points of the subordinate series are approximately proportional to the squares of the atomic masses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic physics"}
