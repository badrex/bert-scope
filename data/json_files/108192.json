He observes that the length of sparks and the occurrence of brushes depend on the size and charge of the conductors. Faraday also explores the relationship between the inductric and inducteous states of the conductors and their influence on the discharge of electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
