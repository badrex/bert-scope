{"article_id": "112377", "revised_title": "On the Density and Properties of Hydrogen-Palladium Alloys", "semantic_tags": ["Chemistry", "Materials Science", "Density", "Alloy", "Gas absorption"], "tldr": "The author, Thomas Graham, investigates the relationship between hydrogen gas and palladium. He finds that when palladium is exposed to hydrogen gas, it forms an alloy with a density close to that of magnesium. The author also discovers that the palladium wire contracts when the hydrogen is removed, and that this contraction can be repeated multiple times. This research contributes to the understanding of the properties and behavior of hydrogen-palladium alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
