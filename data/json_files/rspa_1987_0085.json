They determine the acoustic velocity potential asymptotically when the characteristic speed of the sphere is small compared with the mean sound speed in the fluid. The sound field is expressed using moving source and dipole potentials, providing a more general and simpler representation than previous studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
