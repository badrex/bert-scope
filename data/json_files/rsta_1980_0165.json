Experiments on Nimbus 6 and 7", "semantic_tags": ["Atmospheric Science", "Remote Sensing", "Satellite Technology", "Temperature Measurements", "Atmospheric Composition"], "tldr": "This article discusses the instrumentation and principles of limb radiance inversion radiometers and limb infrared monitors of the stratosphere on Nimbus 6 and 7 satellites. These instruments measure temperature and composition data in the middle atmosphere, providing valuable information for understanding various processes, such as radiative, chemical, and dynamical processes. The data collected from these experiments can be applied to photochemical, dynamical, and transport problems in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
