They found that these external perturbations can split the energy levels of the ions and cause additional electric dipole transitions. The study provides insights into the behavior of hydrogen ions in crystals and can help improve our understanding of their electronic energy levels and vibrational spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
