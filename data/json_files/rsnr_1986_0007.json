These three figures represent the transition from medieval Aristotelian scholasticism to the new natural philosophy championed by Francis Bacon and the empiricism expounded by John Locke. Their works reveal an essentially modernistic outlook, enquiring, unsatisfied, and dynamic, with a strong emphasis on observation and experiment.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
