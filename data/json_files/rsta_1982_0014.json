This method avoids finite-difference treatment of equations and introduces randomness, which mimics the mechanism of local perturbations in a real flow. The random vortex method is suitable for analyzing turbulent flows and has been successful in solving various flow problems, including those involving combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
