They found that while multilayer formation can fill pores in some cases, capillary condensation is the main method of pore-filling. This study provides insights into the behavior of adsorption in porous materials and has implications for understanding and optimizing their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
