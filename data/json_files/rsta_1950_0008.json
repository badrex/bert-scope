They found that the disturbance traveled counter-clockwise around the sea and had a close relation with the progression of the diurnal tide. The study provided insights into storm surges, their transmission through the Straits of Dover, and the effects on coastal areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
