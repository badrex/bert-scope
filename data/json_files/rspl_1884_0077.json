However, the author's findings contradict this belief, as they do not find the bacilli in the pure form in the intestines of cholera patients and discover that they are present in other diseases and even in healthy individuals. The author also questions the validity of experiments on animals, as they do not prove that the comma bacilli can produce cholera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
