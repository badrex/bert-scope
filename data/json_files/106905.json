The tables are based on experiments and can be used to determine the specific gravity and temperature of the mixtures. The author suggests that these tables can be useful for tax purposes and provides a brief explanation of the method used to compute some of the columns.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Liquids and Mixtures"}
