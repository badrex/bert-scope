They found that changes in fluorescence yield during the induction phase are due to changes in the probability of trapped excitation energy being used for photosystem 2 photochemistry and large changes in the probability of energy loss through non-photochemical processes. Significant non-photochemical quenching was observed in both leaves and thylakoids, demonstrating the importance of understanding these processes for photosynthesis research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
