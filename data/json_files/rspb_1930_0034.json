The large, quick adductor muscle is responsible for rapid flapping movements used for swimming, while the smaller, slow adductor muscle is responsible for closing the valves in response to stimuli. The slow muscle has a higher viscosity and is more extensible, making it distinct from vertebrate skeletal muscles. The authors also discuss the differences in innervation and the effects of electrical stimulation on the slow muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
