It shows that the algae release a large amount of maltose during photosynthesis, which is sensitive to the external pH. The findings suggest that the mechanism of maltose synthesis occurs at or near the cell surface and that the algae can control the excretion of maltose by varying the intracellular pH of the gastrodermal cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
