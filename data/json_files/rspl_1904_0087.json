They conclude that the Upper Culm Measures are of Upper Carboniferous age, while the Lower Culm Measures are of Lower Carboniferous age. The study provides insights into the geologic time scale and the evolution of plant life during the Carboniferous period.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
