They discovered significant differences between the species and found that specimens from various parts of the world exhibited a range of morphological variations. The authors propose that these differences may indicate the presence of multiple species or sub-species within the Calliacantha genus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protistology"}
