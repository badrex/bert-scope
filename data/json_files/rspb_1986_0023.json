They found that leaves grown in low light had a higher quantum yield and lower light saturation point compared to those grown in high light. The study also showed that chlorophyll fluorescence oscillations were affected by the light exposure and orientation of the leaves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
