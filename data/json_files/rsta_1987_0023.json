The fungus produces H2O2 through enzymes like glucose-2-oxidase and methanol oxidase, which play a crucial role in breaking down lignin. The fungus also regulates glucose levels in its environment to control H2O2 production and maintain its ability to degrade lignin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fungi and Lignin Degradation"}
