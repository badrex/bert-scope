They determined thermodynamic equilibrium constants, activity coefficients, and heats, entropies, and free energies of sorption for the paraffins. The results showed differences in isosteric heats between hydrogen and calcium-rich chabazite, but not between hydrogen and potassium forms of zeolite L. The study provides insights into the role of sorption in cracking and reforming hydrocarbons using zeolite catalysts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
