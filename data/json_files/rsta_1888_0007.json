They discovered that the elongation of the iron decreases when the magnetizing force is increased beyond a certain limit. The author also developed a new method to create a uniform magnetic field using iron rings, which helped overcome some limitations of previous experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
