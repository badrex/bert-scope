The authors found that the intensity of'spike' X-ray reflexions is roughly proportional to ultra-violet absorption, suggesting that platelets responsible for'spikes' are also responsible for characteristic type I absorptions. The research also reveals that high values of spike intensity and ultra-violet absorption are observed in relatively perfect crystal regions with a low density of grown-in dislocations, while imperfect regions containing many grown-in dislocations may have inhibited impurity precipitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
