They discuss the effects of three-dimensional curvature on the characterization of bound modes and derive expressions for radiation losses for various modes. The study provides a more accurate analysis of optical fibre waveguides with helical or spiral cores, which can be useful in fiber optics, sensors, and integrated optics applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optoelectronics and Photonics"}
