The author suggests that the organism may largely perpetuate itself through medusa-medusa reproduction and may eventually eliminate the hydroid stage from its life cycle. The author also discusses the possibility of sexual and asexual reproduction in medusae and the phenomenon of budding in different groups of medusae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Invertebrate Zoology"}
