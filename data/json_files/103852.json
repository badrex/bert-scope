They discovered that by placing bulbs in water, they could grow stronger and healthier than those grown in soil. The author also found that dried bulbs were more successful in adapting to water environments than fresh ones. This method allowed for year-round blooming and extended the blooming season.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
