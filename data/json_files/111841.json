Crace Calvert, conducted experiments to study the influence of mass on chemical affinity and the solubility of the sulfate of baryta in acid liquors. He found that the solubility of sulfate of baryta is affected more by the bulk of the acid than its strength. This research showed that increasing volumes of nitric acid prevent the formation of sulfate of baryta, and it also demonstrated the influence of relative quantities of salts on chemical affinity. These findings support previous observations on the influence of volumes on the combination of gases and the solubility of substances in liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Affinity and Solubility"}
