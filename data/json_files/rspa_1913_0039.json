They used a monochromatic patch of light and a white patch to compare the brightness and found that the area of the luminosity curve represents the total brightness of the light formed into a spectrum. The study showed that the luminosity curves of color-deficient observers differed from the normal, with either the red or green sensation curve being modified, but the shape of the curve remained the same.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Vision Science"}
