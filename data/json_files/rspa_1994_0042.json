By adjusting the parameters, wavelets with frequency content following the musical scale can be generated, offering greater frequency resolution than traditional harmonic wavelets. The author demonstrates the potential applications of these musical wavelets in analyzing and compressing signals.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Fourier Analysis"}
