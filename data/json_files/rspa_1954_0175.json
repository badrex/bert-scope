They found that the rate of spread of the heat wake is related to the particle diffusion only for short diffusion times at ordinary Reynolds numbers. The mean-square particle acceleration can be computed, and the results show that the accelerated diffusion of heat, caused by intensification of temperature gradients by turbulent motion, is comparable to the total diffusion process. This study provides insights into the understanding of turbulent diffusion and heat transfer in fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
