The authors confirm the reality of inflexions in the X-ray emission and identify new inflections in the range of 235-2 to 317-9 volts. The study provides insights into the behavior of X-rays and their potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > X-ray spectroscopy"}
