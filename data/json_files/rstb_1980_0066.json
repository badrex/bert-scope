The authors describe the development of a whole-body imaging system, the use of magnetic reagents to increase specificity and versatility of measurements, and the potential of 31P NMR zeugmatography for human diagnostic studies and experiments on small animals. They also highlight the advantages of reconstruction techniques in NMR zeugmatographic imaging, such as simultaneous data acquisition and slow magnetic field configuration changes, which improve safety and reliability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
