They found that the current had a significant impact on the growth rate, with the treated plants showing increased growth rates compared to the control plants. The study highlights the importance of carefully controlled conditions and accurately measured currents in understanding plant responses to electric currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
