They discuss the origin and development of the Magnetic Department at the observatory and the photographic recording apparatus used for self-registration of magnetic movements. The author also analyzes the diurnal inequality of magnetic force and its connection with solar radiation, suggesting that terrestrial magnetism is influenced by the sun's radiant heat."}
