They discovered that voltaic electricity can induce momentary currents in a nearby wire, and that this effect can be increased when using iron. They also found that continuous action can be achieved by using a revolving copper disc near a magnet. This research showed that electricity can be produced by ordinary magnetism and has implications for the study of the connection between magnetism and electricity."}
