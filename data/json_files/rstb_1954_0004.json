They conclude that Stensio's interpretation of Cephalaspis' head structure is correct and that the gills were more likely pouches of adult cyclostome pattern. The author also discusses the feeding habits, head shield, mouth, and branchial cavity of Cephalaspis, providing insights into its relationships with other cyclostomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
