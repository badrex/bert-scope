This phenomenon may play a role in determining host specificity for the parasite. Bile from carnivores, on the other hand, did not cause lysis. The study suggests that the nature, type of conjugation, and concentration of bile acids may be significant factors in host specificity for E. granulosus, with implications for other intestinal parasites as well.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
