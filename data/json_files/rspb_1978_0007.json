It found that the distribution of these fibers is closely related to the termination of the commissural fibers of this area. The results show that the intrinsic connections are confined to the commissurally connected zone, connecting separate representations of the same body part and concentrated at the boundaries between architectonic subdivisions. This research provides insights into the organization and connectivity of the somatic sensory cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Somatosensory System"}
