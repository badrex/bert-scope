This transient, called the M peak, is associated with the exponential increase in CO2-dependent O2 evolution and CO2 fixation. The study provides insights into the relationship between the onset of photosynthetic carbon assimilation and the slow kinetics of chlorophyll a fluorescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
