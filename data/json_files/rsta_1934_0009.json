The research focuses on the behavior of iron and steel at low temperatures and how it affects their mechanical properties. The study finds that low temperatures cause iron to become more brittle, while nickel, copper, and aluminum increase in ductility. The article also highlights the importance of nickel in preventing iron from becoming brittle at low temperatures and the potential for high-nickel steels to have desirable tensile properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
