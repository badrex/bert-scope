He developed methods to measure the specific gravity of compounds and acids, and discovered that the increase in density of compounds is due to the attraction or affinity between their components. This research contributed to the understanding of chemical affinities and the properties of acids and salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Attraction and Specific Gravity"}
