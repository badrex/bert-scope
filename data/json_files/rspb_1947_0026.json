They found that the staining reaction varied between individual cells and provided insights into the origin and fate of osteoclasts. The author also compared the distribution of osteoclasts in normal and mutant mice, such as grey-lethal and hydrocephalus-3, and observed differences in their number and size. This research contributes to our understanding of bone growth and development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
