He analyzes the arguments for Weighton, Godmanham, and Londesburgh and proposes a new site based on factors such as geography, Roman road networks, and historical context. He argues that the proposed location offers strategic advantages and access to resources, making it a plausible candidate for the ancient Roman station.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > Archaeology"}
