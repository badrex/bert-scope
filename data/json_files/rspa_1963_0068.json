They estimated atomic force constants and used them in secular equations to calculate frequency distributions of lattice modes for both phases. The results were compared with observed data, showing fair agreement. The study also discussed the values of force constants in relation to the phase change and offered suggestions for interpreting angular stiffnesses in terms of the interaction of the Fermi surface with Brillouin polyhedra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
