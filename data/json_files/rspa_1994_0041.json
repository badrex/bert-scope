The study demonstrates that a tube with varying cross-section can produce significant changes in the solution for small variations, leading to a complicated Duffing-like response and increased amplitude compared to non-resonant and uniform tube oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
