It explores the role of structural features, such as thick cuticles and stomatal opening, as well as subtle protoplasmic properties in conferring resistance. The concept of hypersensitivity is introduced, where plants exhibit a lethal attack by the parasite as a defense mechanism. The article also highlights the complexity of understanding resistance mechanisms in plant-fungal interactions, given the diverse types of reactions and the multitude of factors involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
