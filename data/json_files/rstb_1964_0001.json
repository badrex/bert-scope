It explores the development of mandibles in different arthropod classes, their movements, and the adaptations that have occurred for feeding on various types of food. The study also discusses the differences between mandibles in hexapods and crustaceans and how they have evolved independently.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
