They find that axisymmetric shapes are stable at low rotation rates but lose stability at the bifurcation to two-lobed shapes. The results contribute to understanding the behavior of liquid masses held together by self-gravitation and have implications for experiments on drop shape and stability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
