They compare their model with experimental measurements on hexanone-2 and acetonitrile, discussing the effects of inertial forces and dipole-dipole coupling on the Debye and far-infrared absorption of polar fluids. The model is shown to agree well with experimental observations, suggesting that the two-friction version should be used for further comparisons."}
