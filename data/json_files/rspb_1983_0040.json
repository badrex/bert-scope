It demonstrates that the femoral chordotonal organ and trochanteral campaniform sensilla provide both intrasegmental and intersegmental inputs, and that load afference modulates the flow of proprioceptive and motor information within the walking-pattern generator. The study contributes to understanding the neurophysiological basis of walking in arthropods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Physiology"}
