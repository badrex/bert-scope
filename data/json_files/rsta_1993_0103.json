They introduce a basic model and discuss its features, as well as its ability to reproduce experimental data. The authors also explore growth on vicinal surfaces and patterned substrates, comparing simulated surface morphologies with micro-RHEED measurements. Extensions of the model to more complex growth scenarios are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
