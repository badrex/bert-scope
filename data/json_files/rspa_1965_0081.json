The authors expand the intermolecular energy as a power series in the intermolecular potential and overlap integral, and discuss the energy contributions of different orders. They also explore the extension of long-range intermolecular force theory to include small orbital overlap, which allows for a better understanding of medium-range forces and their applications in various molecular interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Intermolecular Forces"}
