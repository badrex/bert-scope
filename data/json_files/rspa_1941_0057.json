The theory provides a cross-section for the scattering of transversely polarized neutral mesons and explains how the energy spectrum of transversely polarized mesons falls off rapidly for energies below a certain threshold. The results of this study have implications for understanding the behavior of particles in nuclear interactions and the differences between classical and quantum theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
