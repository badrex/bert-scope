They found that the carbonyl carbon atom in ketones always comes from the 2-position in the hydrocarbon. The results suggest that ketones, such as acetone and methyl ethyl ketone, are formed by oxygen attack at the tertiary center in 2-methylpentane, involving tertiary peroxy radicals. The overall pattern of initial oxidative attack is strongly in favor of the tertiary position, but the most effective oxidation of the hydrocarbon follows from initial attack on the secondary positions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
