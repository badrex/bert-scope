They used a sensitive detection system to measure the oscillations in magnetization and found that the Fermi surface of sodium is less distorted than previously thought. The results were used to deduce the Fourier components of the effective lattice potential, which agreed with previous models.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
