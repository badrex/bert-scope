They found that the method of local strychnization is suitable for studying sensory localization and mapped out the position and extension of the sensitive area in the cerebral cortex. The results showed intense and distinct hypersesthesia and hyperalgesia in the monkeys, indicating the importance of the sensory area in the cerebral cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
