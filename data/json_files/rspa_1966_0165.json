They discovered that the observed streakings and spikes in the diffraction patterns can be explained as a Fraunhofer diffraction effect. The intensity distribution around the reciprocal lattice point has three principal maxima and subsidiary maxima separated by the inverse of the width of the stacking fault. The authors used this method to predict the electron diffraction patterns from crystals with different thicknesses and parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
