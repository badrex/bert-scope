They found that the majority of responsive cells in the medial bank of the middle suprasylvian sulcus were selective for image motion along one particular axis and a majority of these were direction-selective. The development of stimulus selectivity in the suprasylvian visual cortex occurs rapidly within the first three weeks of postnatal life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
