Fowler", "semantic_tags": ["Nuclear Physics", "Particle Physics", "Cosmic Radiation", "Heavy Electrons", "Yukawa Theory"], "tldr": "In this article, H. J. Bhabha and R. H. Fowler discuss the theory of heavy electrons and their connection to nuclear forces. They propose that heavy electrons, with masses about a hundred times that of an electron, could be the particles responsible for the proton-neutron exchange interaction. The authors also explore the possibility of these heavy electrons changing their rest mass and disappearing, leading to the liberation of energy. They compare Yukawa's theory, which explains the short range and magnitude of the proton-neutron exchange interaction, with other theories and find it to be the most suitable. The authors suggest further investigation of the relativistically invariant formulation of Yukawa's theory and its consequences in relation to cosmic radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
