They examine the correspondence between nuclear and cytoplasmic dimensions and the number of chromosomes in various plant species, including Primula hybrids and Ascaris varieties. The study aims to understand the role of chromosomes in hereditary qualities and their potential link to phylogenetic relations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
