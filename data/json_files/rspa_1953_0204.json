They compared their results with the ASMO method and found that the new method provided more accurate calculations for these complex molecules. This research contributed to the understanding of molecular structures and electronic properties of conjugated hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
