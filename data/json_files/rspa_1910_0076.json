Through experiments, the author demonstrates that oscillating water can create ripples on smooth and level sand without the need for chance irregularities. The study also reveals how existing ripples initiate new ones, forming a pattern of ripple-marked sand.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Coastal Geology"}
