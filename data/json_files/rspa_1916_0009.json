The authors found that the anode loss is less important in the mechanism of the arc, and the main function of the anode is to receive the carriers of the current produced by the essential process occurring at the surface of the cathode. The study also discusses the factors responsible for the formation of the crater on the anode and not on the cathode.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
