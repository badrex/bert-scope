They also provide a method for expanding complicated vector-coupled integrals in terms of coefficients. These methods are applicable to all Schr\u00f6dinger integrals of vector-coupled functions, contributing to quantum calculations on atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
