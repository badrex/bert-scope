H. Gladstone. They describe the atmospheric effects on the solar spectrum, such as the \"atmospheric lines\" visible during sunrise and sunset. The authors also examine the absorption of light by the atmosphere and the origin of these lines, which is still an open question in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
