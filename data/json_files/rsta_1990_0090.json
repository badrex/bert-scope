It explores the processes of rift-drift, plate convergence, and subduction that led to the formation of these terranes. The article also highlights the importance of local events affecting plate boundaries and the role of allochthonous terranes in the evolution of fold and thrust mountain belts.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
