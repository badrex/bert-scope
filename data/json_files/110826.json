He traces the origins of nerves in different cases and considers the cerebellum as an appendage to the brain rather than to the medulla oblongata and spinal nerves. Swan also discusses the role of the corpus striatum in conveying the perception of limb motions and the double crossings of nerve tracts in the arms and legs, providing explanations for various pathological phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
