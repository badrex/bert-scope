They divide the region of interest into three parts and find that the problem of self-induced separation reduces to the solution of a single problem in the theory of incompressible boundary layers. The theory provides a better understanding of the phenomenon and serves as a foundation for approximate methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
