The research is based on a 4-year series of observations of natural populations in experimental enclosures called Lund tubes. The findings show that summer bloom-forming populations originate from colonial stock that overwinters on the bottom sediment, and growth is stimulated when bottom water approaches anoxia and light penetrates the sediment. The alga's ability to adapt to various microenvironments in eutrophic lakes contributes to its dominance in the plankton.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
