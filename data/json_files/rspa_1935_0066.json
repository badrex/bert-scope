The researchers used three different reaction vessels with varying surface-to-volume ratios to observe the effects on the reaction rate. The results showed that the reaction rate was significantly affected by the surface area, with packed vessels exhibiting slower rates due to the reduced free space. The findings confirm the importance of considering surface area and vessel dimensions in gaseous reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
