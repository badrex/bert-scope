These islets, composed mainly of tree trunks, branches, and roots, were visible during low tides. The trees, including birch, fir, and oak, were found to be well-preserved, with some even having sound timber suitable for use. The author suggests that these islets are part of a larger subterranean stratum of decayed vegetation found throughout the region, which has been exposed due to changes in sea levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
