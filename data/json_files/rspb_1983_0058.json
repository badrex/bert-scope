Among these, the layer VI neurons, known as Meynert cells, have distinct morphological and size differences compared to layer V neurons. This discovery suggests that Meynert cells may provide a more direct pathway to the superior colliculus for visual information than layer V neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Cortex"}
