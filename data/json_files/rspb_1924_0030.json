This correlation is maintained in mammals and birds, suggesting a typical form that varies in scale with the length of the head and body. The author also found that the external diameter of the superior canal can be used as a representative measurement for the canals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
