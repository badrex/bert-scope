It also discusses an experiment on the diffusion of salts in solution, using a specific apparatus to measure the diffusion without intermixing at the common surface. The findings contribute to the understanding of magnetic observations and the study of salt diffusion in solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
