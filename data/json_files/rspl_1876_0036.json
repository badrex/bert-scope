The piezometer records the combined effects of temperature and pressure, allowing for accurate calculations of the depth and temperature at various ocean depths. The author also discusses the advantages of using piezometers in determining deep-sea temperatures, especially in enclosed seas and near ice.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
