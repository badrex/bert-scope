It explores the use of 1H-Fourier transform nuclear magnetic resonance to observe the incorporation of carbon-14 into these molecules. The study confirms the specific and intact incorporation of urogen III and the origin of the methyl groups in these molecules, providing insights into their biosynthetic pathways.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
