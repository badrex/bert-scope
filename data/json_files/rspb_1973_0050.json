The research shows that these herbivores can digest and assimilate blue-green algae, contrary to previous observations. The diurnal feeding patterns of the herbivores were examined, and methods were devised to assess their daily ingestion of algae. The study provides estimates of carbon requirements at other trophic levels and an assessment of the required level of net production by algae for comparison with figures for standing crop and net algal production measured by other means.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Aquatic Ecology"}
