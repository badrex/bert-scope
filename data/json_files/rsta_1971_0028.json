The authors consider a one-dimensional, isothermal, locally at equilibrium system with negligible diffusion effects. They use the Langmuir adsorption isotherm to establish the theories of simple waves, shock waves, and interactions, and discuss the system's behavior based on the flow rate ratio.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
