They discovered that the nuclei of these calculi often contain globular and granular urates, as well as oxalate of lime in various forms. The study also highlights the influence of physical factors on the formation of these crystals and the importance of microscopic analysis in understanding the nature of urinary calculi.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Urology"}
