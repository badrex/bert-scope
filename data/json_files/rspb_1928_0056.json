They found evidence suggesting that these characters are inherited in a Mendelian fashion and that the cytoplasm has no determining influence on them. The study also showed that segregation of these characters can occur in either of the reduction divisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
