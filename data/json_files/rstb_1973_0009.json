They found that cytoplasmic calcium concentration can be raised by calcium influx during high potassium depolarization, sodium elimination, and high pH. The method helps to eliminate extracellular calcium exchange and provides insights into factors controlling calcium concentration in vertebrate smooth muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
