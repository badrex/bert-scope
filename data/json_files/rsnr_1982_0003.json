It also explores the spread of Newtonianism in Italy, with a focus on the connections between Newton and Italian mathematicians and scientists. The letters reveal Newton's active role in spreading his ideas and views on science, particularly in Italy, and his use of Italian visitors to carry his anti-Leibnizian campaign.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
