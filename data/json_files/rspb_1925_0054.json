The author presents experimental methods and sources of error, focusing on distinguishing true osmotic pressures from temporary diffusion pressures and false equilibria. The osmometric observations on hemoglobin satisfy the criteria of permanence, reversibility, and reproducibility, making the osmometer method reliable and accurate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
