They analyze the photographic records of the self-recording declinometer from 1858 and 1859, separating the disturbed observations and calculating their aggregate values. The study reveals that the easterly and westerly disturbances follow distinct laws and have different prevalence times during the day and night. The findings contribute to the understanding of magnetic storms and the Earth's magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Earth's Magnetic Field"}
