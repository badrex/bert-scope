It explores various ways viruses achieve this, such as altering cellular translation, degrading cellular mRNAs, or disrupting cell structure. The article also touches upon bacterial and viral pathogenicity, highlighting the differences in their mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
