The research shows that the spleen's response consists of at least three components: two vascular and one capsular. The capsular response is maximal at low nerve stimulation frequencies, while the vascular response is less than 70% maximum at 10 impulses per second. The findings suggest that the second component of the vascular response may be due to the diffusion of neurotransmitter from the site of liberation to distant receptors, depending on the concentration achieved there.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
