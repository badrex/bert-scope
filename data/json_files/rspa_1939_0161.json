The results show that the kinetics of the hydrogen bromide reaction differ from those of the hydrogen chloride reaction, with no bimolecular reaction occurring in the HBr case. The study also provides insights into the potential energy surface and the stability of the complex H-Br-H.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
