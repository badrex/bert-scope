The authors explore the effects of different drugs on melanophores, discovering that certain drugs, such as nicotine and apocodeine, can induce melanophore expansion in doses that cause general peripheral paralysis of sympathetic nerves. The study also highlights the specificity of pituitary extracts in promoting melanophore expansion and their importance in the mechanism of pigmentary changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
