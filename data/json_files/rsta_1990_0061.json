Bacteria were present in all sediment depths, with some dividing and actively growing. Bacterial sulfate reduction and methanogenesis were measured even in the deepest samples, indicating the potential impact of these bacteria on diagenesis and fossil and oil formation. The results provide insights into the presence and activity of bacteria in deep sea environments and their role in global biogeochemical cycling.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Microbiology"}
