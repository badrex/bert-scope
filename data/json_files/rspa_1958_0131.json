They consider various ways of initiating detonation, such as burning at different conditions and transmission of detonation over distance. The main cause of detonation seems to be a sudden rise in pressure when a suspension of an explosive in gaseous products of burning is formed and exploded. Different ways of forming such a suspension are discussed, and the authors analyze the balance of gas formation and escape at burning to determine the possibility of a pressure rise."}
