They examine the rare occurrence of bilateral movement and the lateral arrangement of fibers. They also describe the antero-posterior order of fibers for different body segments and the nature of these movements. The study reveals that the movement representation in the brain is arranged similarly to the cortex, with extension represented in front of flexion for the upper limb and flexion in front of extension for the toes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
