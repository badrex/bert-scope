The island is composed of various rock types, including granite, felsite, rhyolite, and limestone. The limestone contains numerous foraminifera, indicating that it is of Middle Tertiary age. The author concludes that the oldest rocks in Socotra are gneisses, belonging to the earliest Archaean age, and that the island has experienced volcanic disturbances and denudation over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
