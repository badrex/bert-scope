The technique can be used with complex rotor models supported by an arbitrary number of bearings and can also estimate the lumped spring stiffness coefficients without additional measurements. The method overcomes limitations of previous techniques and offers versatility in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
