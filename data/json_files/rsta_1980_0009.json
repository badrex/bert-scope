The authors describe the Mesozoic history of the basins, the Cainozoic changes in paleo-oceanographic conditions, and the tectonic activity in the region. The study provides insights into the formation and development of the eastern Atlantic margin.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
