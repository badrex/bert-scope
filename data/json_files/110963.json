Higginbottom, studied the British Triton and found that there are only two species, Triton verrucosus and Lisso-triton punctatus. The animal takes three years to reproduce and four years to reach full growth. In its tadpole stage, it lives in water until its legs are strong enough for land movement. During the summer, it is active on land and hibernates in winter. Temperature affects its growth, while light has little impact. Impregnation occurs through water, not contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
