They used the Lebwohl-Lasher model and a truncated dispersion potential to analyze the second-rank Kirkwood factor. The results showed that the factor diverged as the nematic-isotropic transition was approached, in agreement with the Landau-de Gennes theory. The study provides insights into the pretransitional effects in nematogens and the role of molecular structure in their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
