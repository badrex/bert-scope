They argue that the larynx plays an active role in respiration, with its muscles keeping the glottis wider open than in a cadaveric state. This active role of the larynx challenges the common belief that it only assists in respiration during forceful breathing. The author presents evidence from various observations and studies to support their argument.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
