The authors measured the concentrations of atoms and OH radicals, as well as the reactant temperature during the gas-phase combustion. They also investigated the interaction between oscillations in a pair of coupled reactors. The findings provide insights into the complex oscillatory reaction modes and the phase relations between different species concentrations and temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
