They found that the temperature at which the vaccine emulsion is subjected to the chloroform process determines the rate of elimination of extraneous bacteria. The potency of the vaccines was tested on calves, showing that vaccines treated at temperatures below 30\u00b0C had better vesiculation results. This research extends knowledge of the germicidal value of the chloroform process in vaccine preparation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
