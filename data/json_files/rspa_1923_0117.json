The authors develop methods to estimate the concentrations of oxy- and reduced hemoglobin in solution and study the effects of temperature, salts, and chemical reducing agents on the reaction. They find that sodium hydrosulphite is an effective reducing agent for their experiments, and they use the reversion spectroscope to analyze the results. The study provides insights into the kinetics of hemoglobin and its role in respiration."}
