They found that the absorption bands of these compounds are composed of superimposed bands with frequencies of maximal absorption at integral multiples of a common or fundamental frequency. The study provides insights into the selective absorption and chemical analysis of these cobalt compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
