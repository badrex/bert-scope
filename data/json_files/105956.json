They found that the number of eggs in each species varied greatly, with some fish having millions of eggs. The author's findings challenge previous accounts of fish fecundity and provide a more accurate understanding of fish reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
