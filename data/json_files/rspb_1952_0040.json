They found that cell nuclei contain small amounts of RNA, but the possibility of cytoplasmic RNA adsorption during the isolation process cannot be excluded. The study also showed that there is no correlation between the RNA content of isolated nuclei and the prominence of their nucleolar systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
