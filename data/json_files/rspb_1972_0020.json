They found that xanthoxin has a higher biological activity than other inhibitors and can be converted into abscisic acid (ABA) by plants. Xanthoxin works by antagonizing the growth-promoting effects of plant hormones like 3-indolylacetic acid, gibberellic acid, and kinetin. The authors also prepared xanthoxin derivatives and studied their activities in various tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
