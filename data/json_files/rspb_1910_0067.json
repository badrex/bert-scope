The author reviews previous research on the topic and presents new micro-chemical methods to determine the precise seat of acid formation. The study finds that hydrochloric acid is formed in the parietal cells of the gastric mucosa, contributing to the understanding of the digestive process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Gastrointestinal Physiology"}
