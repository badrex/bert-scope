Three types of cells are described: electrochemical cells, electrolysis cells, and photoelectrosynthetic cells. The critical semiconductor electrode properties for these cells are the band gap, the -band potential, and photoelectrochemical stability. The author also describes a variation of electrolysis cells called diodes and recent advances in photocatalytic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
