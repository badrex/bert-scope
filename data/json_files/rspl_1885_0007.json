They analyzed the microscopic structures developed in various glass forms, such as cubes, hexagonal prisms, and spheres, after being devitrified under controlled conditions. The study provides insights into the natural devitrification of obsidians and other glassy rocks, which can help in understanding the formation of rocks and minerals.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
