He used a self-registering thermometer enclosed in an iron cylinder to avoid any external influences. The experiment showed a significant decrease in temperature as the depth increased, with the surface water temperature being around 82\u00b0F to 83\u00b0F, while the temperature at a depth of over 1,000 fathoms was around 45\u00b0F. This study provides valuable information on the temperature variations in the deep sea and the potential effects of heat on water density.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
