It examines the population dispersal and multiregional evolution hypotheses, focusing on the impact of new dating methods and mitochondrial DNA studies. The author highlights the significance of discoveries that support the population dispersal scenario, which posits that modern human populations evolved from a single common ancestor in Africa and dispersed to other regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Evolution"}
