They derive expressions for stored energy and the rate of dissipation of energy for any material element at any time. The study focuses on isotropic materials, and the authors show that the stress-strain law can be expressed in operational form. They also demonstrate that models consisting of Voigt elements in series or Maxwell elements in parallel can represent the mechanical properties and stored and dissipated energies of any visco-elastic material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
