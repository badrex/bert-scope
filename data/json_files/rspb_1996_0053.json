The tau mutation accelerates the period of the circadian activity cycle, and the research shows that tau and wild-type hamsters exhibit a differential response to photoperiod change. The tau genotype may have a different critical night-length with respect to both the gonadal and prolactin axes, approximately 1-2 h shorter than wild-type genotypes, supporting the hypothesis that the circadian tau mutation has altered the basis of photoperiodic time measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
