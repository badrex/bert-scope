The authors develop equations for the variation of these elements and discuss the expansion of the gravitational potential. They also examine the rates of rotation of the orbital plane due to the Earth's potential and the impact of the ellipticity of the equator on this rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
