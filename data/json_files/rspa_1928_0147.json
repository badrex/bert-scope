The authors found that the height of the ozone layer appears to increase between autumn and spring, which corresponds to the increase in the average amount of ozone during this time. The study also suggests that the height of the ozone layer is greater when the amount of ozone is greater, indicating a connection between the amount of ozone and its height in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
