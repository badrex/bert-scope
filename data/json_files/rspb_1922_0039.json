The researchers measured the heat evolution of a fasting hog at different temperatures and fasting durations using a calorimeter. They observed that the resting metabolism varied throughout the fasting period and found that temperature played a significant role in the hog's metabolism. The results provide insights into the effects of temperature on basal metabolism in swine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
