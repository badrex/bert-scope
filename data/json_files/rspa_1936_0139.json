They used a quartz microbalance and a modified apparatus to measure the densities and dielectric coefficients of these gases at different temperatures. The results provided insights into the physical properties and moments of these gases, which can be useful for understanding their behavior and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
