The author discovered that the lengths of the crystal axes increase with temperature, and the expansion of the 'c' axis is much smaller than that of the 'a' and 'b' axes. Additionally, the author found that some paraffins can form a second structure with different properties under certain temperature conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
