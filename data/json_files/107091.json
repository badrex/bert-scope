The silver ore was found in a specific area of the mine, near an intersection of copper lodes. This discovery was unusual because, although lead veins in Cornwall often contain silver, no other instance had been known of such a large quantity of silver ore. The author provides a detailed account of the location and characteristics of the silver ore, as well as the surrounding copper lodes and their relationship to the silver deposit.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
