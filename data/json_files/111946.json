The method is an extension of Cayley's work on conic sections and can be potentially applied to the general problem of contact. However, working out cases for higher order curves, such as a cubic of nine-pointic contact, would require significant effort.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
