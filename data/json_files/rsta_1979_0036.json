The authors find that induced fission track techniques can help determine the microscopic distribution of uranium in rocks and minerals, providing insights into the processes of primary magmatic variations and secondary mobilization of uranium. They also discuss the effects of halmyrolysis and hydrothermal alteration on uranium concentrations in oceanic rocks, and the importance of understanding these processes for estimating the composition of the oceanic upper mantle and determining the geochronology of ocean floor spreading through radiometric dating.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Geochemistry"}
