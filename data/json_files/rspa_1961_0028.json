The results show that the presence of precipitated polymer increases the lifetime of the kinetic chain and decreases the rate of reaction. The study supports the occlusion theory, which explains the unique characteristics of bulk acrylonitrile polymerization.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
