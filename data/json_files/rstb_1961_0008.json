The beetles primarily feed on broom plants, and their population is influenced by temperature, rainfall, and predation. The research provides a detailed life-table for the insect, highlighting the importance of various mortality factors, such as predation, parasitism, and environmental conditions, in shaping the population's growth and survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
