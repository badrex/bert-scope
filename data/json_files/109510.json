He described the process of creating this compound and its explosive properties, as well as the chemical reactions involved. The main components of the compound are nitrous etherized gas and oxalate of mercury with excess oxygen. The author also discussed the theory of the compound's combustion and the potential dangers of working with it.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
