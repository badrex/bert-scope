The study focuses on the rapidly varying initial velocity and the slowly varying ultimate velocity, using the method of matched asymptotic expansions in the limit of small Mach number. The results provide insights into the cylinder's velocity and the acoustic field induced by its motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
