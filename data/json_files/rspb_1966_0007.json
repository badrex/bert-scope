The research focuses on the role of endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodies, and organelle changes during the development of a cambial initial into a mature sieve element. The findings provide insights into the structure and function of plant tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
