The authors used various methods, including adiabatic and isothermal expansion, to measure the heat capacity of hydrogen. They found that previous experimental results had inconsistencies and errors, and they provide a detailed analysis of the corrections needed for accurate calculations. The article also compares different experimental methods and their results, highlighting the challenges and limitations of each approach.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
