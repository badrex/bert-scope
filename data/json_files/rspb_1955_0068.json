It shows that the majority of passive immunity transmission occurs after birth, with the concentration of maternal antibodies in the young rising rapidly from the 17th day of gestation to the 2nd day of lactation. The research also highlights the presence of antibodies in amniotic and exocoelomic fluids and the stomach contents of foetal rats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
