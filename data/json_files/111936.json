The disturbance affected telecommunication systems and was accompanied by auroras. The author uses magnetograph data from Kew Observatory to analyze the event and suggests a connection between magnetic disturbances, earth currents, and auroras, which may be linked to fluctuations in solar activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
