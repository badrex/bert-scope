The model is used to estimate the ratio of links to species in individual food webs, providing a better understanding of the structure and proportions of species and links in these ecosystems. The results show that the cascade model provides a good description of the numbers of intermediate species and various types of links, while offering a fair to poor description of the number of top and basal species and basal-top links.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
