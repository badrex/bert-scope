They found that the major lipids in the organism are phospholipids, consisting of phosphatidylethanolamine, phosphatidylglycerol, and phosphatidylcholine. Additionally, they discovered a sulpholipid and a new lipid containing ornithine. The study concluded that there is no specific lipid associated with chromatophores in the organism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
