He finds that the periodic time of Venus is nearly equal to eight years, and calculates the difference between the mean motions of Earth and Venus. The author presents a detailed method of calculation, including perturbations of Earth's longitude, radius vector, latitude, and Venus' perturbations depending on the same arguments. He emphasizes the importance of seemingly insignificant terms in planetary theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
