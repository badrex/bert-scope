The study also provides a summary of the spectra of southern stars to the 3.5 magnitude and their distribution, finding that stars with more advanced spectra are evenly distributed in space, while stars with more recent spectra are more concentrated in the galactic zones.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
