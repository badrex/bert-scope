They discovered that the strength of the effluvia and the temperature of the air affected the amount of light and electricity produced. The author also found that the effluvia of a separate heterogeneous body could give motion to threads inside a glass globe, even without touching the glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
