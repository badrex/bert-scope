They found two unfolding transitions, both cooperative, and the second transition involved complete unfolding of immunoglobulin- and fibronectin-like domains. The folding energy associated with this transition is comparable to the energy required to extend titin molecules in situ, suggesting a possible role in muscle elasticity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
