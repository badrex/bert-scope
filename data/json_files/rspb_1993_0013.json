They found that warm-responsive neurons depolarized and increased firing frequency when warmed, while cold-responsive neurons showed the opposite effect. The warm-activated current in warm-responsive neurons had a more positive reversal potential than in cold-responsive neurons, suggesting that differences in resting ionic conductances are responsible for the distinct behaviors of these neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
