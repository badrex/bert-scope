They found that when only the inner cylinder rotates, the flow becomes unstable at a certain Reynolds number. The experiments also determined the critical Reynolds numbers for the transition from stream-line to turbulent flow and the effect of rotation on these critical speeds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
