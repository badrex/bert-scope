The authors discuss the importance of understanding individual responses to patchiness and how they lead to diverse ecological and evolutionary outcomes. They also examine the role of physical environment heterogeneity and organismal adaptations in shaping patchiness and its effects on species distribution and coexistence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
