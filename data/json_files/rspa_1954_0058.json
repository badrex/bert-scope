It considers the role of the solvent and the Frank-Condon principle, and provides a theoretical understanding of the mechanism and factors influencing the rate of electron transfer. The study covers non-adiabatic electron transfer, electron transfer by tunnel effect, and the energy differences between initial and final states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
