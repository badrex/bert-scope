The researchers discovered new seeds and analyzed the plant's external and internal morphology, providing insights into its classification and relationships with other ancient plants. The findings suggest that Buriadia heterophylla may be a unique type of conifer or a plant not easily assignable to any known group of gymnosperms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
