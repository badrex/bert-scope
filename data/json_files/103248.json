Hauksbee conducted an experiment to study the production of light within a globe glass lined with sealing-wax. He found that the light produced on the sealing-wax was similar to that of glass, and it appeared even on parts with varying thicknesses of wax. The light disappeared when a small amount of air was introduced, suggesting that the light production was related to the effluvia provoked by the attrition of the surrounding glass. Hauksbee also observed that the lined glass attracted bodies in a vacuum, similar to a magnet.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
