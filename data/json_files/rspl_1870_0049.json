Garrod, developed a combined cardio-sphygmograph to study the relationship between the heart's contraction and the radial pulse. The instrument allowed for accurate measurements and demonstrated that the heart contracts before the pulse is indicated at the wrist. The study also found that the length of the first cardio-arterial interval is just over half that of the first cardiac interval, regardless of the pulse rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
