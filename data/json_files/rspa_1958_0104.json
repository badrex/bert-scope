The researchers found that the contractions in the length of a porous glass adsorbent are directly related to the energy of hydrogen bonds formed between the surface hydroxyl groups and the adsorbed molecules. The temperature-dependence of the contraction process is also explained by changes in the spectral shifts and the distribution of adsorbate molecules on different adsorption sites. A model of the surface conditions is proposed to explain the contractions when hydrogen bonding is operative.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
