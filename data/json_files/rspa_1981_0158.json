The author extends the methods developed for homogeneous problems to a simple inhomogeneous situation, considering a pseudo-cycle interaction involving an inhomogeneous wave vector and a homogeneous system. The analysis provides a more complex solution than the homogeneous case due to an additional singularity, but it can be used for larger values of than previous work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
