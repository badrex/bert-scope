The authors measured concentration differences and transfer velocities to calculate gas fluxes across the sea surface, providing insights into atmospheric chemistry and climate regulation. The research also explored the seasonal and spatial variability of DMS and other trace gases, as well as the factors influencing their exchange rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
