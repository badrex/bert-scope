The research examines the role of crystal imperfections and the involvement of a liquid halogen phase at the interface, which contributes to the reaction mechanism. The findings provide insights into the form and function of reaction nuclei and challenge previous mechanistic conclusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
