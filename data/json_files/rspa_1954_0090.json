The research considers the effects of longitudinal and transverse winds and shows that transverse winds are more effective in producing disturbances. The findings provide insights into the behavior of water currents and surface levels under the influence of wind, which is essential for understanding ocean dynamics and predicting weather patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
