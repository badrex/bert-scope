He introduces the concept of the effective inner surface and effective thickness of the shell, which depends on temperature and pressure. Hopkins also refutes the idea that active volcanos directly communicate with the central fluid nucleus of the Earth, as the thickness of the solid portion of the globe is estimated to be at least 800 to 1000 miles.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
