The results show that the cooling in the troposphere is not very different from that calculated from radiation charts, and the importance of clouds on the radiative pattern is demonstrated. The measurements are of limited value in the stratosphere due to the small quantities of water vapor present.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
