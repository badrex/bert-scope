They observed similarities in the absorption spectra of these molecules and found that at low temperatures, the spectra become more distinct with separate bands. This research contributes to the understanding of the properties and behavior of complex organic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
