The results show that exercised mdx mice had improved contractile properties and muscle function, with increased resistance to fatigue and a higher proportion of oxidative muscle fibers. The exercise program was beneficial for the mdx mice, enhancing muscle regeneration and reducing muscle fatiguability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
