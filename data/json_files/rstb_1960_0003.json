The research explores the patterns of limestone, marl, and bituminous shale in the off-shore facies, as well as the skeletal limestones, oolites, conglomerates, and cherty beds in the near-shore facies. The study also investigates the relationship between the fauna and the sediments, as well as the environmental conditions, such as temperature, salinity, sedimentation rate, depth of the sea, and current strengths.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Stratigraphy"}
