The authors found that anthrax spores can survive in various types of water for long periods, posing a risk to public health. They also discovered that the multiplication of the bacteria depends on the water's chemical composition and that the power of propagation in sterile water is limited.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
