It focuses on Sturm-Liouville series and their convergence properties, expanding on the work of Schmidt, Hilbert, and others. The author demonstrates the application of these series to a wide range of functions and discusses the potential for further development and extension to other expansions, such as Legendre's and Bessel's functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analysis"}
