The accumulation of this soap in the surface is influenced by the nature of the soap solution, with the highest accumulation occurring in solutions with an excess of either oleic acid or alkali. The author also concludes that the structural basis of the black spots in soap films is an acid sodium soap.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
