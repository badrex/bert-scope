They discovered that the retina in the eye is transparent during life, and the optic nerve has a semi-transparent state. The author also discussed the limitations of previous theories on nerve structure and the importance of using appropriate microscopes for accurate observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
