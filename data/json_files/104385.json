The water had a sulfurous smell and taste, and through various experiments, it was confirmed as a purging water. The author discusses the properties of the water, its effects, and possible reasons for its medicinal properties. The new spring proved to be more convenient than the old wells, as it was closer to London and well-protected from weather damage.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
