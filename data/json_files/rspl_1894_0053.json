They found that the presence of a salt in solution can increase or decrease the value of thermo-electric properties depending on the nature of the salt. The results suggest that the thermo-electric properties in a solution are due to the superposition of a salt effect on that due to the water itself.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
