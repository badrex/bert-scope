They used different types of instruments, including those by Jones and Dollond, to measure the dip and magnetic intensity. The observations aimed to improve the accuracy and understanding of the Earth's magnetic field for navigation purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
