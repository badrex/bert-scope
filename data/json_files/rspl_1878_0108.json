The author finds that the distortion causes a slow rotation and a shift in longitude, which could have had an impact on the Earth's early history. The findings also suggest that the continents' wrinkles follow a specific pattern, and the distortion may have played a role in their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
