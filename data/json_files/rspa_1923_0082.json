The author argues that the properties of aqueous solutions are determined by the interaction of these components, which include hydrone molecules, dissolved substances, and potential electrolytes. This explanation offers a simple, chemical-based understanding of osmotic phenomena and electrolysis, and it challenges the traditional view of water as a neutral substance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
