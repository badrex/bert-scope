The author develops a new bridge instrument to study the effects of self-induction in straight wires and single wide loops. The research reveals that self-induction and mutual induction are distinct phenomena, with copper wires having a low coefficient of self-induction and a high coefficient of mutual induction, while iron wires have a high coefficient of self-induction and a feeble coefficient of mutual induction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
