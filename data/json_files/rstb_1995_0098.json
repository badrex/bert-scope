It reveals the presence of lateral line placodes in the head of embryonic eptatretid hagfishes, which corresponds to the skin grooves in adult hagfishes. This indicates that an embryonic lateral line system exists in hagfishes, and the grooves in adult hagfishes likely derive from lateral line placodes, making the presence of lateral line placodes a primitive character of craniates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
