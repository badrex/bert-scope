They assume that the position of the joint at the inlet end of the chain is fixed, and the pipes are subject to conservative forces. The motion is observed to be approximately independent of the effects of fluid friction, and a theoretical model is used to analyze the system. The authors also discuss the stability of equilibrium and the conditions for instability, including buckling and self-excited oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
