They found that the glycosidic bond length in BUDR is shorter than normal, and the conformation of the C5'-O5' bond is not the most commonly found. The study provides insights into the structures of halogenated deoxyuridines, which can be incorporated into DNA and cause biological changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
