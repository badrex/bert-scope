The liquid exhibits properties similar to an aqueous solution, and the reaction is reversible, with the liquid turning back into solid ammonia nitrate and ammonia under certain conditions. The study provides insight into the atomic relations and molecular combinations of these substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
