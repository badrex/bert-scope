Otoconia, found in the gravity receptors of the vestibular labyrinth in most vertebrates, are dynamic mineral deposits with organic and inorganic components. The study reveals that otoconia are composite structures with highly ordered crystallites and suggests that organic material plays a role in calcium ion binding, exchange, and release. The article also discusses the possibility of piezoelectricity in otoconia due to their asymmetrical subunits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomineralization"}
