The role of descending pathways, neurotransmitter candidates, and the nature of inhibitions were examined. The involvement of different neurotransmitters, particularly endogenous opioids, was also a focus of the discussion. The article highlights the complexity of pain research and the need for further investigation into the mechanisms of pain perception and modulation."}
