The authors analyze the mechanics of folding and how it is influenced by factors such as initial morphology, mechanical properties of the rock, and overall finite strain. They also explore the role of strain-softening and the propagation of folding in the evolution of deformation structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
