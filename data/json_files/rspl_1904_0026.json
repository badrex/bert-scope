The authors found that the electromotive phenomena in horse nerves resemble those in other mammals but differ in magnitude. They also discovered that non-medullated nerves have a rapid decrease in negative variation when subjected to repeated tetanizations, and this decrease is due to changes occurring at the point of excitation. The study provides insights into the differences between non-medullated and medullated nerves and contributes to the understanding of nerve physiology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nerve Physiology"}
