They find that glass, silicates, borates, and phosphates absorb gases, especially carbon dioxide, while metals absorb hydrogen and its compounds with carbon. This research challenges the traditional understanding of the three states of matter and suggests a continuity between the liquid and gaseous states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
