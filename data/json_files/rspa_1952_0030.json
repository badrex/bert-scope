They specialize the theory for the case of pure homogeneous finite deformation and apply it to various problems, including indentation and deformation of thin sheets. The study uses tensor notations and provides a comprehensive analysis of the strain-energy function and stress-strain relations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
