It describes the formation of the ophthalmic, nasal, frontal, and maxillary nerves, as well as the connections between the Gasserian ganglion, ciliary ganglion, and other related structures. The study also clarifies the differences between the development of the fifth nerve and other cranial nerves, such as the facial and glossopharyngeal nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
