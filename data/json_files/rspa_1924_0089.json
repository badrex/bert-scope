They found that the non-luminous vapour absorbs lines of the sharp and diffuse series and discovered anomalous dispersion at 3775 (1, 7r2-d, a) and very feeble anomalous dispersion at A 5350 *6. These findings provide valuable information about the quantum state of atoms in the normal state and the critical potentials of elements in this group.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
