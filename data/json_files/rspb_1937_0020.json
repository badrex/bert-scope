They found that the hair-cell theory of the Wever and Bray phenomenon is not valid, and the membrane theory provides a better explanation for the cochlear component of the phenomenon. The results also suggest that following nerve section, a basal meningitis occurs, leading to serous labyrinthitis and potential chronic obstruction to the flow of perilymph.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
