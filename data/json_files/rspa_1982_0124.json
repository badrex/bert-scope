The model combines these effects in a single framework and provides a method for calculating drag perturbations when the density scale-height varies with altitude. The research focuses on the contraction of satellite orbits and the perturbations in the elements describing the contraction, which can be used to study the behavior of satellites and the properties of the upper atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
