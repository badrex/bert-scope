They use numerical data for the reduced coordinates of their meridia to examine the equilibria of two fluids and the stability of equilibrium configurations. The study discusses different kinds of instability and compares the results with earlier work and contemporary studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
