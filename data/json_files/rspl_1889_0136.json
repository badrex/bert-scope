They took photographs of Vega with varying exposure times and found that the spectrum reached its limit due to atmospheric absorption, not insufficient exposure. This discovery helped to better understand the behavior of light in the Earth's atmosphere and the properties of stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
