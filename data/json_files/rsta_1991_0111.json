The authors find that the forces are largely balanced between drag and slab-pull, and that the torquc balance model can be used to describe the evolution of plate dynamics over the Cenozoic Era. The study focuses on the North and South American plates, comparing stress models with stress orientations to better understand the forces at play.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Plate Tectonics"}
