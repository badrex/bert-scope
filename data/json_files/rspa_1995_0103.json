They find that the optimal profile has a vorticity of constant magnitude at its surface and determine the minimum effective radius for such a profile. The study provides insights into the design of bodies experiencing minimal drag in fluid flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
