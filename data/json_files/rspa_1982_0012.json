They use a diabatic representation and a discrete state crossing a continuum to describe the process. The theory reduces the Schr\u00f6dinger equation to a non-denumerably infinite set of coupled equations, which they solve to obtain a formula for the S-matrix, containing all probabilities and phases associated with the collision. This theory is different from previous models and can be applied to various negative ion-atom collision systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
