Snow Harris, conducted experiments to study the elementary laws of electricity. He discovered that the attractive force of electricity is inversely proportional to the square of the number of conductors it is divided among. Harris also investigated the electrical capacities of various shapes and found that the capacity of a sphere or cylinder is the same as that of a plane with the same surface area. He concluded that explanations of electrical repulsion based on the action of the atmosphere are fallacious.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
