They develop a non-local spinor field quantity and use reciprocal commutation relations to create an -matrix free of convergence difficulties. This new formalism offers a different perspective on densities and observability in small space-time regions, potentially leading to a more accurate understanding of elementary particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Field Theory"}
