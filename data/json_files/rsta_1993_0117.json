The authors present simple synthetic receptors that function via hydrogen bonding in highly competitive solvents and demonstrate their use in inducing discrete 2+2 aggregates stabilized by a network of hydrogen bonds. The study of these artificial receptors provides insights into the underlying chemistry of molecular recognition and has potential applications in the design of molecule-selective sensors and interference with physiological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Supramolecular Chemistry"}
