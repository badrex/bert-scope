The expedition found a barren and mostly uninhabited land with some unique flora and fauna, including black swans, sea cows, and large rats. Two shells, Nautilus and Concha Persica, were collected and sent back for study. The letter also mentions the unsuccessful search for a ship carrying Sir James Couper, presumed to be stranded in the area.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geography"}
