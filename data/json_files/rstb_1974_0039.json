They analyze pollen and mollusc assemblages from various sites, revealing a temperate pollen assemblage and dividing mollusc assemblages into different facies. The study provides insights into the environmental conditions during the deposition of the Icenian Crag and its correlation with Pleistocene stages.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Stratigraphy"}
