The author, W. Heberden, explores the properties of this salt and its potential uses. He compares it to other salts, such as natron and nitrum, and explains how it can be used in various applications, including making matches and creating soap and glass. The author also speculates on the possible formation of this salt and its abundance in the air or earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
