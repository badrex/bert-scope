They identified the plant source as an Acokanthera species and described its chemical properties and pharmacological actions. The active principle is similar to a substance found in plants from the Somali country. The poison's effects on frogs and rabbits include slowing and stopping respiration, paralysis of the heart, and muscle rigidity. The authors suggest that the poison's action is due to a combination of central and peripheral effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Pharmacology and Toxicology"}
