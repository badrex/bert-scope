These compounds show the formation of a definite base when urea combines with chromium. The author also discusses the properties and formulas of various compounds derived from the initial dichromate salt, including chloroplatinate, chloride, sulfate, and nitrate forms. The study contributes to the understanding of the chemistry of urea and chromium compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
