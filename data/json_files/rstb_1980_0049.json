The author proposes two main classes of \u03b2-lactamases, based on their amino acid sequences and molecular properties. The article also highlights the importance of understanding the mechanisms of these enzymes for developing new antibiotics and combating antibiotic resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
