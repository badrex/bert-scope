The author conducts experiments using various metals and methods to determine the moduli of longitudinal and torsional elasticity. The results show that the velocity of sound in metals is affected by stress and strain, and the author provides a detailed analysis of the experiments and findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
