The authors collected over 16,000 temperature observations and over 4,000 samples for salinity analysis. They found that surface waters along the eastern seaboard of North America are drifted eastward towards southwestern Europe. The circulation reaches its maximum intensity in winter and almost dies out in summer. The authors also discuss the variations in the European stream, which is responsible for melting ice and affecting the water circulation in the Arctic Ocean.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
