The authors explain the importance of using antisymmetrical wave-functions to describe these phenomena and demonstrate how the exclusion principle can be applied to collisions between electrons and atoms, as well as to the scattering of electrons by atoms with oriented magnetic moments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
