The most active compound found is 4,4'-dihydroxy-y:5-diphenyl hexane, which has a meso or internally compensated form. The study shows that the 4,4'-position is the optimum for the greatest activity, and any alteration in the structure leads to a significant reduction in activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
