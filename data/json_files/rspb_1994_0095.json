They suggest that this is because a helper's relatedness to the brood decreases with an increasing number of helpers in the former case but not in the latter. The study focuses on the dunnock, Prunella modularis, as a model system and concludes that female choice may set a limit to cooperative polyandry in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
