They discover that some substances, like potassium, show an increase in resistance during electric wave impacts, while others exhibit a decrease in resistance. This study helps differentiate between positive and negative actions of radiation and highlights the importance of understanding the nature of sensitive substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
