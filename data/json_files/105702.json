He discovers that the sand contains a significant amount of iron, but it is strongly bonded with a stubborn earth. After several trials and using a different flux, Horne successfully extracts a malleable metal from the sand. This discovery could have significant implications for iron production and trade.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metallurgy"}
