The authors propose a mechanism called the \"induced image effect\" to explain void growth in materials like steel, where the dislocation density does not drop at saturation. They provide a mathematical formulation and numerical evaluations of the interaction energy and force between a screw dislocation and a void, which can help in understanding the growth kinetics of voids in materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Dislocation Theory"}
