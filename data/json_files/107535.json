The animal had large ribs, a long snout, and conical teeth. The author compares the animal's skeleton to those of other fish and concludes that it is a distinct species from any currently known. The drawings of the bones provide evidence of the animal's growth and structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ichthyology"}
