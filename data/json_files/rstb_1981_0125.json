It suggests targeting seed dormancy and vegetative regeneration as potential areas of development in weed control. The author also considers other aspects of weed behavior that could be manipulated for control purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
