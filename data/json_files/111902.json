He found that these bases have unique properties, such as forming double compounds with platinum and gold dichlorides. Some of these bases are weak and can explode under heat or percussion. Griess also discussed the decomposition of these bases, which can produce interesting compounds like mercaptans.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
