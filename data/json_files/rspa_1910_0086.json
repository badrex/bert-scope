They find that the surface tension remains constant within a short time after the surface formation, and discuss the differences between their results and those obtained using drop vibration methods. The author also explains the influence of air resistance and the velocity differences in the jet on the phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
