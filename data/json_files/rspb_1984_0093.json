The induced receptors caused oscillatory inward membrane currents, which were mainly carried by chloride ions. This study provided insights into signal transmission across chemical synapses in the brain and the role of receptor messengers in adult brain cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
