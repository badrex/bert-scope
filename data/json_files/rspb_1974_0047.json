The researchers found that the eyes contain long single cones, short single cones, double cones, and rods. The red pigment in the pigment epithelium prevents all but red light from reaching the long single cones and rods when extended, which may help the fish adapt to their underwater environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
