The authors examine the influence of composition on the tendency for surface crack propagation during straightening and compare it with the hot ductility behavior measured by Gleeble tensile tests. They find that soluble aluminum is the most detrimental to ductility, while niobium reduces hot ductility significantly at lower temperatures. Phosphorus has a small beneficial effect on hot ductility. The study suggests that Gleeble test results can be used with confidence to predict the behavior of other steel compositions during continuous casting.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
