These trees, found buried several feet below the ground, are used for timber, lathes, and lighting tobacco. They are similar in texture and appearance to fir or pine trees and are believed to be native to the area, despite the absence of such trees in the region today.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleobotany"}
