The fluid contains albumen, phosphate of potash, and a small amount of fat. This discovery suggests that the process of assimilation in these worms is similar to that in higher animals with well-developed digestive and circulatory systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
