They discussed the evaluation of two-particle elements and applied their findings to the -shell, considering central, tensor, and spin-orbit forces. The study aimed to derive the spins and moment data of certain -shell nuclei from a two-body charge-symmetric interaction containing central, tensor, and spin-orbit forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
