Sinistrality is a rare trait in this species and behaves as a Mendelian recessive character. The delay in the inheritance of sinistrality is attributed to the twist of the animal and its shell being determined at the early stages of egg division. Albinism, on the other hand, is inherited directly and interferes with the simple scheme of inheritance due to the general tendency for sinistrals to become dextrals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
