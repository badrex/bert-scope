The model introduces the layer thickness and ice area fraction as smoothly varying functions of the plane coordinate and time, and eliminates the issue of area fraction exceeding unity in converging flow by incorporating a ridging process. The authors also derive a reduced model that describes the major balances in the motion and construct an exact one-dimensional solution to illustrate the evolution of a moving boundary.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
