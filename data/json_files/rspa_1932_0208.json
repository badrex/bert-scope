The authors use Dirac's relativistic equation to calculate the coefficient and compare their results with experimental values. They find that their calculations are in good agreement for certain -rays, but not for others, suggesting that the internal conversion process may involve a special type of interaction with the nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
