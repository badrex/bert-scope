The authors demonstrate how these techniques can provide information on ion-water conformations and ion-ion correlations in electrolyte solutions. The methods allow for a direct measurement of partial structure factors and radial distribution functions, offering a valuable tool for understanding the molecular behavior in aqueous solutions."}
