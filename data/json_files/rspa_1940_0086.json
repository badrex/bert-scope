The authors propose a lattice of freely suspended magnetic dipoles as a first approximation to represent a paramagnetic alum. They discuss the configuration energy, partition function, and the critical temperature of the system, providing insights into the behavior of paramagnetic alums under various conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
