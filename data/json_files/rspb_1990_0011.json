The results show that N-linked carbohydrate attachment is essential for the functional expression of voltage-operated channels during the early stages of nerve cell growth in culture, while channels in mature neurons become less dependent on glycosylation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
