Researchers found that stress conditions can induce reversals in the resorption directionality, and they propose that non-programmed cell deaths, triggered by stress, may cause these reversals. The findings provide insights into the complex interactions and hierarchy within chimeric colonies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
