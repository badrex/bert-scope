They found that mutations in the asparagine-155 residue, which forms a hydrogen bond with the substrate's carbonyl oxygen, significantly reduced the enzyme's activity. This research highlights the crucial role of hydrogen bonding in the catalytic mechanism of serine proteases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
