They find that the component of the magnetic field perpendicular to the field decreases exponentially with time, while the component parallel to the field remains constant. No energy emerges from the black hole, as kinetic rotational energy transforms into irreducible mass. This study has astrophysical relevance and extends the understanding of black holes in the presence of magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
