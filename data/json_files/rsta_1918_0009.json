They explain how the scattering of X-rays is due to the constituent electrons in the matter and how the intensity of scattered radiation varies with the wave-length of the primary radiation. The author also provides evidence against the quantum or entity theory of radiation, as the phenomena of scattering do not suggest any discontinuity in the process of radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
