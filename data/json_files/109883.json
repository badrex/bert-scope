He found that the expansion and contraction of the cellular processes in living trees play a significant role in the ascent of sap and tree growth. Knight also suggested that these processes could be responsible for the formation of rifts in trees, which were previously attributed to wind or frost.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Forestry and Tree Biology"}
