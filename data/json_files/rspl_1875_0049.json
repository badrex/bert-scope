By studying the larvae and their parents, the author identifies the parent forms of some known larvae and determines those of several unknown genera. The study reveals a unity of character throughout the various forms and changes of crustaceans, demonstrating the homological truth and the potential for suppressed or tendered parts to be reproduced under specific conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
