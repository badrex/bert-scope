The authors conducted experiments to test the effect of various corrosion products on the passage of oxygen through liquid. They found that the presence of corrosion products generally retards the passage of oxygen, except when there is settling during the experiment, in which case the passage of oxygen is accelerated. The authors discuss the implications of their findings for understanding corrosion and the role of corrosion products in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
