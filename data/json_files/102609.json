Molyneux compares the Scolopendra Marina, a marine arthropod he described, with Rondeletius's Physalus, a different species of animal. He examines their physical characteristics, such as size, shape, and appearance, and concludes that they are distinct species. Molyneux also discusses the behavior of the Scolopendra Marina, noting that it is not poisonous, as it was found in the stomach of an animal that had consumed it as food.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
