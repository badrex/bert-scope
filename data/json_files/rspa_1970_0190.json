The authors compare the structures of simulated liquid arrays with random packing and demonstrate the validity of Bernal's concept of the liquid state. They also examine the structural differences between real and idealized systems by artificially hardening the interaction potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
