They provide examples from lower vertebrates like Teleostomes and birds, highlighting the influence of compression and pressure on the brain's shape and structure. The author emphasizes the importance of considering these factors when studying the differences in brain morphology among various species and races.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
