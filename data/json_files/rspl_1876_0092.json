They discovered that an increase of 1% in humidity has the same impact on air quality as a rise of 4.18 degrees Fahrenheit in temperature. This emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper hygrometric conditions, especially in sick rooms, to ensure good ventilation and air quality.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
