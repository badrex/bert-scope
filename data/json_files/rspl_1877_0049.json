The authors found that a higher voltage is needed for smaller distances between terminals, and observed that the voltaic arc is stratified under a microscope. They also mentioned their ongoing work on examining the action of bromine on normal paraffins.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
