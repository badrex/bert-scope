The experiment aimed to test the hypothesis that a close combination between an electron and a hydrogen nucleus might occur under certain conditions, leading to a decrease of mass and evolution of energy. The results showed that the heat produced and the energy supplied agreed to less than 1%, indicating that no significant energy evolution occurred in the discharge tube. This negative result does not affect the hypothesis about the origin of stellar energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
