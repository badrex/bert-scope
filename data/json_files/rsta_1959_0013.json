They determine the asymptotic behavior of the solution by analyzing the edge singularities and propose an approximate solution. The reflexion coefficient and the end correction are evaluated, and the results are compared with other authors' findings, revealing a new effect called the evanescent mode correction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
