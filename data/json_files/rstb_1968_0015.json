The research explores the zonation of marine communities, from the supralittoral zone with salt-resistant plants to the eulittoral zone with various algae and crustaceans, and the coral reef communities, including the algal ridge, grass beds, and reef edge. The findings contribute to understanding the sedimentation and fauna of the Seychelles Bank and the importance of calcareous-skeleton secreting organisms in the ecosystem.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
