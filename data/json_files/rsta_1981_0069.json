They explain how the formation of the Aegean Sea by extensional tectonics is related to the subduction of the Mediterranean floor below the Hellenic arc. They estimate vertical movements in the Aegean area and demonstrate that the outer arc was built up since the beginning of this episode of subduction by vertical uplift, likely due to underplating. Finally, they discuss the dynamics of subduction and marginal sea formation processes in this continental collision framework.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodynamics"}
