The observations were made using magnetometer Elliott Ho. 61 and Dip Circle Dover 83. The author also discusses the resistance of electrolytic cells and the electrolytic deposition of copper. The findings may be affected by local volcanic disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
