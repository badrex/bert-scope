They find that the change in refrangibility of light occurs when it passes through the solution, which affects its ability to produce the same effect again. The author explores the possibility of a change in refrangibility as the cause of this phenomenon, which aligns with the undulatory theory of light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
