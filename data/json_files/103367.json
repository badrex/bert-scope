He noticed a canopy of white striae descending from a white circle of faint clouds and estimated the center of the phenomenon to be 14 degrees south of the zenith. Halley also observed a succession of whitish striae ascending from the east-northeast and northeast, which changed into luminous smoke and passed overhead with incredible speed. He believes that if it weren't for the bright moon, this event would have been considered as significant as the Aurora Borealis event of March 6, 1716.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
