The technique detects light-induced heat produced during non-radiative de-excitation, which helps in understanding the energy transfer processes and efficiency in plants. The author explains the principles of photoacoustic detection, different instrumentations, and various applications, such as measuring induction kinetics, time constants, and photoacoustic spectra, which provide valuable information about pigment composition, depth profiles, and energy transfer efficiency in plant samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
