The jet flap increases lift by ejecting a thin sheet of high-velocity air with a downward inclination from a slot near the trailing edge. The study uses thin aerofoil theory to obtain an exact solution for small jet-deflection angles, considering an infinitely thin jet with finite momentum. The results provide insight into more complicated flows and are in close agreement with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aerodynamics"}
