They used a direct-recording Fabry-Perot interferometer to measure profiles of lines in the spectrum and found that the broadening can be ascribed to resonance interaction. The authors also discussed the nature of higher-order interactions, pressure shifts, and temperature dependence in the neon spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
