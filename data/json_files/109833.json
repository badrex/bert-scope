Donovan, discovers a new vegetable acid called sorbic acid, found in the fruit of Sorbus aucuparia. He compares it to malic acid and demonstrates their differences through chemical reactions and analysis of neutral salts. Donovan also discusses the potential transformation of other vegetable products into these acids, but acknowledges the limitations of such speculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
