The first paper discusses the flux integral for axisymmetric perturbations of static space-times, and the second paper focuses on calculating diffracted intensities from crystals containing planar faults. The corrections address various typographical and mathematical errors found in the original papers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
