The author discusses the distinction between a piece of music and its performance, and how listeners interpret rhythmic and tonal relations. A computer program is described that transcribes classical melodies into stave notation, demonstrating the steps by which listeners create a rhythmic and tonal interpretation of a musical piece.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
