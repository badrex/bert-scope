They found that the accumulation of a depressant substance at low temperatures affects the respiration rate, and that the development of this depression is influenced by temperature. This research provides insight into the complex relationship between temperature, respiration, and sugar concentration in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
