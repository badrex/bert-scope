They study the variation in the pattern with the velocity of the stream or the depth of the doublet. The author finds that at lower speeds, the pattern consists mainly of transverse waves, while at higher speeds, the diverging waves become more significant. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of surface waves and their applications in fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
