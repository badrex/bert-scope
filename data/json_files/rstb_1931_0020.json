They found that some species yielded up to 50% of the original glucose as mannitol, making it a potentially valuable method for mannitol production. The study also highlighted the importance of aeration and controlled conditions for optimal results.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
