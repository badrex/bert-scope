It reviews observations from different areas that illustrate the diverse features of this phenomenon, which is still not fully understood. The authors explore the geophysical and geochemical characteristics of crust formed by back-arc spreading and the different models proposed to explain the origin of extensional features in various regions. They also emphasize the importance of plate tectonics in understanding these extensional features."}
