The research shows that the amount of urobilin in the feces is much higher than in the urine, indicating a significant amount of hemoglobin destruction. The findings suggest that hemoglobinuria in blackwater fever is an overflow from the normal channel of excretion, and that the hemolysis in this condition has reached an exceptional level.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
