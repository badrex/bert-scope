The reaction is a rapid bimolecular process yielding electronically excited molecules in the first (triplet) and second (singlet) excited states. The intensity of the emission obeys a relationship similar to equation (i). The formation of electronically excited molecules in this reaction requires a higher activation energy than the formation of ground state molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
