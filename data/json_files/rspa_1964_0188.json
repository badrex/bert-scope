They found that the films had a dielectric dispersion with one relaxation time and that only the hydrocarbon part contributed to the capacitance. The thickness of the films was deduced from the parallel plate capacitor formula, and the results were compared with the literature values for cell membranes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Science"}
