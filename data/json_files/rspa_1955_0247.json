The theory considers both solid and wake blockage effects and suggests controlling the pressure on the outside of the porous wall to eliminate interference caused by wind tunnel walls. The author also discusses the advantages of porous-walled tunnels over conventional tunnels in transonic flow regimes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
