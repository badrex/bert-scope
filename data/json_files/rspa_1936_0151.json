They find that the distance between contacted surfaces is larger than previously estimated, challenging previous notions on molecular forces. The optical tests focus on the distance between the contacted surfaces rather than the range of the attractive force beyond that distance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Physics"}
