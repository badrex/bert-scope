The tryphine is synthesized in the tapetum and consists of a fibro-granular and lipidic component. It aids in pollen adhesion to stigmatic papillae and can penetrate the outer layers of the stigma. In incompatible crosses, the tryphine stimulates the formation of the callosic reaction body, which prevents pollen tube growth. This research provides insights into the complex mechanisms of plant self-incompatibility systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
