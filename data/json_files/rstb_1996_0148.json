The research reveals that the wild wolves have a similar degree of nuclear variability as the captive animals, which have been subject to intense inbreeding. The findings provide insights into the genetic status of the endangered grey wolf population and the usefulness of microsatellites for addressing close genetic relationships and overall genomic analysis of individuals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
