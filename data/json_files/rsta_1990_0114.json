The theory considers systems with many closed and few open channels, and it can handle interactions other than Coulombic long-range interactions. The authors apply the theory to a simplified model for the dissociation of HCN, demonstrating its potential for understanding chemical reactions and molecular dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reaction Dynamics"}
