The observations were compared with those made by Captain Rochfort Maguire in 1852, 1853, and 1854 at Point Barrow. The study aimed to understand the periodical laws of magnetic disturbances at different locations and their impact on navigation and geographical physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
