This adaptation allows the bat to have a longer detection range and increases the availability of these insects as prey. The results support the allotonic frequency hypothesis, which suggests that using low-frequency echolocation calls is an adaptation to overcome the hearing abilities of tympanate insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
