The results show that endrin and lindane block functional insect neuronal GABA receptors, suggesting that these insecticides inhibit GABA-receptor function and may cause convulsive seizures and increased neuronal activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuropharmacology"}
