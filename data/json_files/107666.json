The results showed that when the nerves were divided and the voltaic battery was applied, the stomach contents were digested more efficiently, and the animal's breathing and overall health improved. This discovery could have implications for understanding nerve regeneration and improving medical treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
