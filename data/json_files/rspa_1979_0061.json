It presents recent results on the X-ray structure of clusters, including the Centaurus and Virgo clusters, and reports preliminary findings of a study of 30 cluster X-ray spectra. The detection of highly ionized iron emission lines in the spectra of several clusters is also discussed, and estimates of iron abundance are presented.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Astronomy"}
