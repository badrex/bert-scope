Using electron micrographs and computer analysis, the researchers found evidence suggesting that centromeres are not randomly arranged on the metaphase plate but are ordered in two haploid sets, following a model based on spatial association of corresponding arms of similar size on heterologous chromosomes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
