The authors conducted experiments using a rotating annulus apparatus and found that the flow behavior is influenced by the topography's shape and size. The results provide insights into the complex interactions between the Earth's atmosphere and ocean currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysical Fluid Dynamics"}
