The technique is based on exciting atoms in a sample with a direct current spark and measuring the intensity of a lead line, which is proportional to the lead concentration. The method is sensitive, accurate, and suitable for small sample sizes, making it useful for analyzing substances obtainable in limited quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
