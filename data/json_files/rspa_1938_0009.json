They discovered that the polarity of individual strokes to the ground is generally negative, and the stepped leader process involves a different mechanism than the dart streamer. The authors also proposed that negative streamers travel along a previously ionized channel, with the step streamers following a slower pilot streamer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Electricity"}
