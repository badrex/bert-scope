The research finds that the scaling of abundance on body size differs significantly within individual assemblages and challenges the energetic equivalence rule, which suggests that all species in assemblages use equal amounts of energy. The findings highlight the complexity of understanding size-abundance patterns across different ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
