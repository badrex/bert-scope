The research found that high oxygen pressures inhibit the respiration process and cause a block in the tricarboxylic acid cycle. This blockage leads to an accumulation of pyruvate, alcohol, and citrate, and a decrease in the contents of alpha-ketoglutarate and oxalo-acetate in apples. The findings support the operation of the tricarboxylic acid cycle in apples and provide evidence for further investigation into the pathways of respiratory metabolism in plant structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
