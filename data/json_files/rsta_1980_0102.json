Fatigue crack growth tests were performed on a steel with reduced concentrations of impurities in both dry air and vacuum. The results showed that growth rates were significantly faster in air, especially at low stress levels, and the impure steel exhibited enhanced mean stress sensitivity. The study suggests that hydrogen concentration plays a crucial role in the fatigue process, with phosphorus on grain boundaries contributing to decohesion.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fatigue of Materials"}
