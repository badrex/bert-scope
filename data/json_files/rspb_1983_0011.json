They argue that vision in compound eyes is not limited by photon shot noise at high light intensities but by the finite signal-to-noise ratio achievable by the transduction mechanism. The study also predicts that diurnal insects undersample by a factor of about 2 and that the information capacity of the eye increases with the frequency response of transduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
