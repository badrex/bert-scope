They analyzed the spectrum, focusing on the correction and extension of the doublet series, and identified various structures and terms. The study provides accurate series limits and contributes to the understanding of germanium's atomic and material properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Quantum Physics"}
