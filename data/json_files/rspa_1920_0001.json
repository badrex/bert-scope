Their findings contribute to understanding the properties of dielectrics and the propagation of electromagnetic waves over the earth's surface, which is essential for wireless telegraphy and telephony. The experiments were performed on slate and marble, two common constituents of the earth's crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
