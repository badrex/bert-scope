The island is a natural reserve with high forest and diverse plant species. The author observes the transition of the forest from an initial Casuarina phase to a Barringtonia-Terminalia phase, and eventually to an inland tree-dominated ecosystem. The island's flora and fauna are being studied for conservation purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
