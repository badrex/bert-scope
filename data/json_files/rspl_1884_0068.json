They discovered that the cartilage contains a small percentage of chitin, which is not present in the cartilage of vertebrates. This finding shows that chitin plays a role in the supporting structure of invertebrates and is not exclusively epiblastic in origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
