They propose an iterative method of solution and apply it to a square repulsive core potential. The phase shifts show splitting, as expected from Thomas term arguments, indicating that the method is effective in explaining the spin-orbit force in the proton-proton interaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
