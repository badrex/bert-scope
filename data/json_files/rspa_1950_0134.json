The authors develop a dimensional analysis to understand the behavior of the supercurrent and normal current independently. They discuss the implications of detailed theories of superconductivity by Heisenberg and Born & Cheng, examining their relevance to high-frequency effects. The study provides experimental tests for these theories and contributes to the understanding of superconductivity and its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
