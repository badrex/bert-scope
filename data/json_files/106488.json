The caterpillars were observed to arrive in large numbers from the sea coast, suggesting they were not native to the area. The author provides a detailed description of the caterpillar's life cycle and suggests that the female deposits her eggs in the edge of the turnip leaf using specialized instruments. Efforts to control and prevent the damage caused by this pest are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Agriculture and Crop Science"}
