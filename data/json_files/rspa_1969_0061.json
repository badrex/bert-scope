They show that this method only requires the evaluation of pseudo six-dimensional integrals, making it possible to calculate wavefunctions for larger systems. This approach provides a solution to the problem of including all quantities in wavefunctions, which has been discussed for over thirty years.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
