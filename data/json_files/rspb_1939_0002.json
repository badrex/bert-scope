They found that ferrets exposed to additional light came into reproductive activity. By interrupting various levels of the visual pathways, they concluded that retinal stimulation affects the pituitary gland, which plays a role in gonadal stimulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
