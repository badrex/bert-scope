It examines the role of acid produced by organic matter decomposition in dissolving metastable carbonate minerals in pore waters. The study also highlights the significance of carbonate recrystallization in altering the isotopic and elemental composition of these minerals. The findings suggest that over half of the gross carbonate production is dissolved or recrystallized, affecting the interpretation of paleo-ocean carbon isotope composition in bulk-rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Sedimentary Geology"}
