The research shows that high, fluctuating temperatures occur during the rubbing contact between a metal and a transparent solid. The results are in general agreement with those obtained by other physical methods. Some measurements are made of the time required for the formation and decay of the 'hot spots'. The maximum temperature rise is limited by the melting point of the solid, but with readily oxidizable metals, very high temperatures are occasionally observed due to the oxidation of the metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
