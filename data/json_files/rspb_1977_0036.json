They found that cycloheximide interferes with long-term memory, while ouabain and ethacrynic acid block access to short-term memory. These findings suggest that these chemicals may affect the early labile memory store and provide insights into the material basis of memory formation and storage.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
