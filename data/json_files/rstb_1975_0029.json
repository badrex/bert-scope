The authors find that the mechanisms of acceleration produced by adrenaline are different in each type of fiber. In Purkinje fibers, the activation threshold for potassium current is shifted in a depolarizing direction, while in atrial fibers, the pacemaker potassium current is increased in amplitude. The roles of cyclic 3',5'-AMP and intracellular calcium ions in mediating the pacemaker actions of adrenaline are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology > Cardiac Physiology"}
