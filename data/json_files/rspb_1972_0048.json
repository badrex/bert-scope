Phytoalexins have different chemical structures depending on the plant family and can play a role in disease resistance. The author reviews various phytoalexins found in plants, their accumulation, and their effects on pathogens. The term \"phytoalexin\" should be used to describe anti-microbial substances formed in infected plants, and future research should focus on understanding their roles in disease resistance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
