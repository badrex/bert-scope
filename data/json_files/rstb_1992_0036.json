Most primary forest bird species were present in areas selectively logged eight years prior. However, certain taxa, such as flycatchers, woodpeckers, trogons, and wren-babblers, became comparatively rare. Nectarivorous and opportunistic frugivorous species were more abundant. The findings suggest that logged forests are important for bird conservation, but they should not be considered alternatives to primary forest reserves due to the susceptibility of logged forests to fire and the incomplete understanding of bird behavior and population dynamics in logged forests.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
