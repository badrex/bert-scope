The experiment involved a swinging bar with a coil of wire, and the results showed that not more than one part in a thousand of the Earth's magnetic field can be attributed to a magnetic effect of moving matter, similar to that of moving electricity. This suggests that the mass equivalent to one electrostatic unit is at least 5,000 gravitational units, or 20,000 kilograms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
