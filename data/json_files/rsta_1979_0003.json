The authors analyze the interaction between vortices and sound waves, demonstrating how acoustic radiation can carry energy away and cause instability. They also discuss the implications of these findings for turbulence and mixing layers in fluid systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
