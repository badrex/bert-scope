This method is faster than other methods like Aitken's extension or the root-squaring method, and it avoids the accumulation of arithmetical errors. The authors demonstrate the method's application on quartic, sextic, and octic equations, and discuss singular cases that may arise.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
