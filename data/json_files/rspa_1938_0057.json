They concluded that external radiation and spontaneous decay of beryllium could not account for the helium content in beryls. It is likely that the helium comes from another source, as the amount found in different minerals does not correlate with the percentage of beryllium present. The authors suggest that beryls may simply prevent the escape of helium, while other minerals containing the same helium-producing element may not be as effective at retaining it.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nuclear Physics"}
