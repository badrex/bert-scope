It discusses the process of finding envelopes and the formation of singular solutions from differential equations. The paper also covers various examples, including lines in osculating planes, congruency of common tangents to quadric surfaces, and inflexional tangents to surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
