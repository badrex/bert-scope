The author introduces conformal normal coordinates and conformal Gauss coordinates, which are used to study asymptotically simple solutions of Einstein's field equations. Conformal geodesics are found to be useful in analyzing the behavior of physical geodesics near conformal infinity and provide a simple transition from the conformal to the physical description of space-time."}
