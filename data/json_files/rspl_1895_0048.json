Ludwig invented the kymograph, a device that revolutionized the way physiologists study pressure and flow in the circulation, and the mercurial blood-pump, which allowed for the extraction and analysis of gases in the blood. His work paved the way for further research on the control of blood flow by the nervous system and the study of vital functions of organs and glands."}
