They used a new electric fluxmeter to record the fields and discovered that the process links the positively charged top of the lightning channel with fresh regions of negative charge within the cloud, giving rise to separate strokes. The mechanism of intermittent discharge of this column is discussed, and evidence is provided from field-change records.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
