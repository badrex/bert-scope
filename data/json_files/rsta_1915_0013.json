The authors found that the specific heat decreases with increasing temperature, and they deduced the values of the total heat of saturated steam at various temperatures. The results indicate that the coefficient of specific heat might increase at temperatures below 104\u00b0C. The authors also developed a method to determine the cooling effect of steam more accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
