The researchers focus on a one-dimensional system, examining the liquid's behavior during ignition and the subsequent heat transfer processes. They analyze the effects of depth, surface dimensions, and initial liquid temperature on the duration of the induction period and propose a probable sequence of events that determine its end.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fire Safety and Combustion"}
