They conduct experiments by removing specific leaf pairs and observe the changes in leaf angles. The results challenge the inhibition hypothesis and suggest that the bijugate arrangement is due to a combination of factors, including leaf base shapes and pressure exerted by the upstanding parts of the second youngest leaf pair on the stem apex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
