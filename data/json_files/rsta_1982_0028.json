The authors used seismic data to interpret the Mohorovicic discontinuity (Moho) and found evidence of an anticlinal form beneath the Moray Firth Basin. The study provides important constraints on the evolution of sedimentary basins in the North Sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
