He decomposes the wax using hydrate of potash, obtaining a wax acid and another substance, cerotine. Brodie determines the formula of cerotine as C54H54 and names it cerotyle. He also discovers that cerotine can be converted into cerotic acid through oxidation. The author explains the decomposition of the Chinese wax and announces plans for further research on myricine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
