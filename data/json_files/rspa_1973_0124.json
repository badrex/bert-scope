They propose a new series for the perturbation theory and discuss its convergence criteria. The method is applied to the Lipkin model, a two-level many-body problem, and is shown to provide a good approximation and better convergence than ordinary perturbation theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
