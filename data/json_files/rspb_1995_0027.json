The results show that the survival of chicks from additional eggs is significantly reduced, suggesting that constraints on egg production may limit the number of young that can be successfully raised and contribute to discrepancies between observed and predicted optimal clutch sizes in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
