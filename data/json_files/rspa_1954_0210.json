They discovered that the mechanism of flame propagation changes within the drop-size range of 7 to, with smaller drops behaving like a vapor and larger drops burning individually in their own air envelope. This transformation affects the lower concentration limit of inflammability and the burning rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
