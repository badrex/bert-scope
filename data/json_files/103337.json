Thomas Bates, a surgeon, and other authorities implemented methods to suppress the disease, including buying and burning infected cows, quarantining affected areas, and monitoring cow-keepers' compliance. Bates also conducted dissections to study the disease's effects on the cows' organs. These efforts helped control the spread of the disease and provided valuable insights into disease control and public health measures.", "scientific_discipline": "Veterinary Medicine > Epidemiology and Disease Control"}
