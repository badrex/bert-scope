They found that fats are absorbed partially as dissolved fatty acids and partially as dissolved soaps, depending on the animal species. The solubilities of fatty acids in bile are sufficient to account for the removal of all the fat from the intestine as dissolved fatty acids or soaps.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Lipid Metabolism"}
