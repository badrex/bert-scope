It shows that only the endoplasmic reticulum in the light-sensitive region of the cell is sensitive to InsP3, and the release of calcium is controlled by a negative feedback mechanism. This feedback contributes to sensory adaptation in the photoreceptor and may explain oscillatory membrane responses observed with large injections of InsP3.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
