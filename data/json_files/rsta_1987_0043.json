The model uses computational methods to predict the behavior of JET plasmas and allows for extrapolation to future tokamak-type plasmas. The model takes into account various aspects of plasma behavior, including magnetic field configurations, particle transport, and energy conservation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
