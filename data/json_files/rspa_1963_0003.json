They estimated the individual rate constants for the reaction steps and found that the reaction order varies between one and two. The results provide insights into the reaction mechanism and help understand the behavior of ethane in the presence of nitric oxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
