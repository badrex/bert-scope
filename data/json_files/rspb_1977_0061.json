They discover that the junction is sharply differentiated into two types of epithelial cells and that the delthyrial covers grow through the expansion of deltidial plates and the secretion of a bonding sheet between the cuticle and shell. This research provides valuable insights into the anatomical changes that occurred during brachiopod evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
