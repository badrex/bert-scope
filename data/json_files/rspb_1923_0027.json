They found that X-rays with varying wavelengths had different effects on the tissues, providing evidence for a differential action. This research has implications for understanding the potential use of X-rays in treating tumors and diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Histology"}
