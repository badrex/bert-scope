The researchers found that the liminal test stimulus rises sharply before and after the conditioning stimulus. They also discovered that the course of recovery of dark adaptation is the same for both positive and negative contrast of the test stimulus. The study concludes that personal variation in recovery rates is due to real differences in the rate of recovery of the eye's photochemical mechanism. The equivalent background formula is found to apply to conditioning stimuli, and a simple formula is established for the effect of a succession of conditioning stimuli. The research also shows that scotopic brightness of the stimulus is related to subsequent recovery of dark adaptation, not photopic brightness."}
