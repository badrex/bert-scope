The researchers found that the absorption spectra of these compounds are dependent on the nature of the anion or co-ordinated radical. They also discovered that the ultra-violet absorption bands of copper derivatives of diketones and fatty acids differ, with the former showing distinct bands and the latter not showing any ultra-violet bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Coordination Chemistry"}
