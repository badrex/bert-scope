The results showed that certain sensory impulses, such as touch and muscle sense, mainly travel on the same side, while painful sensations cross to both sides. The study also demonstrated the return of associated movements and provided insights into the conducting tracts of the spinal cord and their implications for spinal cord injuries in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
