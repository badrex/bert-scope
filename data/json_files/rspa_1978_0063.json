They measured the magnetic susceptibilities and interpreted the results within a quantum mechanical model. The study showed that the antiferromagnetic coupling between cobalt atoms is almost entirely determined by interactions between metal orbitals, likely through a superexchange process involving the delocalized bonding framework of the bridging carboxylate groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
