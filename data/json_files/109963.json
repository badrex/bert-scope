He suggests that the black pigment in the skin and the eyes of certain animals helps to convert the sun's radiant energy into heat, providing a protective effect against sunburn and injury. This discovery highlights the importance of skin pigmentation in protecting against the sun's rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
