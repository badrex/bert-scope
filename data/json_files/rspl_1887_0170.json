They describe the various stages of development, from the early stages of the embryo to the adult form, focusing on the skeletal system and its evolution. The study provides insights into the unique features of Apteryx and their evolutionary history.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Ornithology"}
