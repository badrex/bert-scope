These spirals have characteristic shapes and are related to the crystal's etch figures. The study provides evidence that the growth mechanism involves the addition of large unit blocks preformed in solution as ordered clusters, which can explain the occurrence of twinning in the crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
