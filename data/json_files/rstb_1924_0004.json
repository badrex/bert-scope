By examining various specimens, the author identifies three distinct sets of Rhexoxylon, each with unique features. The study reveals similarities between the plant's structure and modern lianes, suggesting a bane habit of growth. The author also discusses the process of disruption and the formation of new vascular tissue in Rhexoxylon, which modifies the distribution of tissue in the plant axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
