H. Potter. The experiments showed that the magneto-caloric effect is related to the change in magnetization and temperature in iron. The results support the Weiss theory and provide insights into the magnetic properties of iron and ferromagnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
