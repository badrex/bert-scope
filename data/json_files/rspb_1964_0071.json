The expedition collected around 3000 plant specimens, with 15 of them being endemic. The team discovered two new species and four new varieties of figs, contributing to the understanding of the fig flora on the mountain. The expedition also led to the establishment of the National Park of Kinabalu, which aims to conserve the diverse lowland to subalpine forest for future generations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
