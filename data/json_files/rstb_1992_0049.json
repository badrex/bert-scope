It explores the dynamics of polymerization and the activity of motor proteins, which play a crucial role in the spatial organization of the cytoplasm. The author highlights the importance of understanding these processes for the assembly of complex structures like asters, spindles, and leading edge structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
