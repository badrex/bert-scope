Waterhouse, discovered that by using a blue-stained dry collodion plate, reversed photographs of the solar spectrum beyond red could be obtained. This new technique has potential applications in spectroscopic photography, particularly for mapping parts of the spectrum that are difficult to observe with the naked eye. The author also discusses the effect of different dyes on the sensitivity of the plates and the reversal of blue and violet rays.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
