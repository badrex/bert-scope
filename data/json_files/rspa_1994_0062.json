They derive an asymptotic formula for the Eulerian numbers directly from their recursion relation and find that it agrees with previously known results. The analysis also provides a boundary layer representation for the Eulerian numbers, which can be used to determine the constant in the asymptotic expansion.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Combinatorics"}
