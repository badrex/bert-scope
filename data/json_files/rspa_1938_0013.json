They introduced the concept of the correlation tensor, which helps determine the correlation coefficients and provided a more efficient method for calculating these coefficients. The study also explored triple correlations and their impact on turbulence dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
