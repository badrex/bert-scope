J. Hinde's paper on the bands of siliceous material found in the Carboniferous Limestone formations. The author argues that the silica in chert bands comes from the small amount of mineral present in ocean waters, rather than from the decomposition of sponge-remains. They also compare the development of siliceous sponges in the Cretaceous and Carboniferous periods, showing that they were much more abundant in the Cretaceous period, making them an unlikely source for the silica in the chert bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Chert Formation"}
