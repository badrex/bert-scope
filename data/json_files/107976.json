The observations were made at equal intervals of time, and the results were used to determine the laws that regulate the periodical changes in the barometer's readings. The findings could potentially improve weather prediction and understanding of atmospheric pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
