They mention their own contributions and the potential of their observatory vault to provide valuable data. This would help in convincing anti-Copernicans by proving that the center of the sphere of fixed stars does not change its place due to Earth's annual motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
