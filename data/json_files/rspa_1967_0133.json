They achieved improved accuracy and determined the signs of the optical rectification coefficients for these materials. The results were consistent with the theoretical relation between linear electro-optic and optical rectification coefficients, providing insights into the nature of the underlying processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystal Physics"}
