They observed that the lattice parameters of iron remained unchanged, while palladium experienced lattice expansion. The results showed that hydrogen blisters formed within single crystals of iron, indicating that hydrogen diffusion occurs through the crystal grains rather than along crystal boundaries. The findings have implications for understanding the mechanisms of overvoltage and hydrogen diffusion through metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
