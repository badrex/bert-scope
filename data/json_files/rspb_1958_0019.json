The cuticle is capable of hydroxylating phenylalanine and tryptophan, producing various polyphenols, including hydroquinone, catechol, and pyrogallol. The non-specific hydroxylation process is not enzymatic and involves transamination reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
