The authors propose a non-equilibrium statistical mechanics approach to describe the evolution of dislocation structures during loading and unloading processes. They also suggest a plausible variation in the probability density function for mobile dislocations and provide numerical examples illustrating the effects of loading rate and recovery.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Plasticity"}
