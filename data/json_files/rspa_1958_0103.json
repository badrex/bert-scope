They demonstrate that the spatial distribution of current within a conductor is independent of its thermal and electrical properties and can be calculated using a simple numerical integration. The theory is applied to the calculation of the spatial distribution of current for a particular shape of conductor relevant to resistance welding processes, showing good agreement with experimental data.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
