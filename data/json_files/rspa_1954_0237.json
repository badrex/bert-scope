The author analyzes various experimental data and theoretical models, concluding that many common fluids do not behave like classical viscous fluids when subjected to ultrasonic disturbances. The author proposes a new approach to understanding fluid behavior, considering them as mixtures of components with different properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
