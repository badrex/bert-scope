These solutions, called Kelvin modes, have time-dependent wavenumber and velocity components and can either decay or grow continuously despite viscous dissipation. The study includes two-dimensional flows with uniform vorticity and stagnation point flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Fluid Dynamics"}
