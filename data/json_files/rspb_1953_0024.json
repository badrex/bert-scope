The authors analyze the chemical and crystallographic evidence for these molecules and explore different chain models, including the a-helix model proposed by Pauling, Corey, and Branson. They also consider the implications of cystine residues and the complexities of X-ray patterns observed in natural a-keratin fibers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure and Function"}
