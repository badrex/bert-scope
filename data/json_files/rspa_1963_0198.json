They found that the crystals are uniaxial negative and have a long-wavelength absorption edge at about 6000. The absorption spectrum consists of a series of absorption bands attributed to hydrogen-like series of absorption levels. Photoconductivity was observed in the crystals at room temperature, suggesting that the photocurrent arises from the thermal dissociation of exciton states of the halogen doublet.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
