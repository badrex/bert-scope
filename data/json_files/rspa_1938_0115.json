They discovered that nitric oxide reacts with ethane at a rate comparable to the primary decomposition process, which challenges previous assumptions about the role of nitric oxide in inhibiting the decomposition of ethane. The study provides a more accurate understanding of the reaction kinetics and the role of nitric oxide in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions"}
