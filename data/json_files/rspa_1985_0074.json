The new parametrization is an interpolation between the Percus shielding approximation and the bulk pair correlation function, with a semi-empirical modification to satisfy the surface tension. The resulting pair correlation function is in good agreement with computer simulations and satisfies a sum rule for the slope of the density profile.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
