The research finds that male gorilla canines have higher levels of asymmetry and are positively correlated with the year of collection, indicating that sexually selected structures are more sensitive to environmental stress than non-sexually selected traits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Primatology"}
