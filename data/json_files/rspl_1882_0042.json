They used a staining method to identify these bacilli in the condensed aqueous vapour of the breath. This finding suggests that particles contagious to susceptible individuals may be constantly breathed in, possibly leading to the spread of the disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
