They found that the coral growth was rapid, while the accumulation of foraminiferal deposits was slow. The study also revealed variations and abnormalities in the structure of the corals, which may have implications for understanding ancient and recent coral faunas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
