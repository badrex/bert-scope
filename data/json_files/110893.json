Beck conducted dissections of the uterus nerves in both unimpregnated and gravid states to determine if any changes occur during pregnancy. He found that the nerves supplying the uterus are continuations of the hypogastric plexus and undergo no significant changes during pregnancy. He also suggested that the uterine vessels may not decrease in size after childbirth but are only contracted within their cavity. Further investigation is needed on these subjects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy of Reproductive System"}
