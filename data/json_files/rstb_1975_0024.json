The results suggest that the node of Ranvier has ten times more sodium channels than the squid giant axon, with similar sodium conductance per channel. The findings provide insights into the functioning of the nervous system and the control of sodium conductance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
