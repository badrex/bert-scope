They demonstrate that elliptic integrals of every order can be represented by these hyperconic sections and discuss the similarities between these curves and the more familiar conic sections. The author also highlights the importance of understanding the geometrical basis of elliptic integrals, which has been previously overlooked by mathematicians.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
