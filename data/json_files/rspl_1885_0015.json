They found that fat levels are highest in February and March, and decrease in the summer. The author also observed that fat distribution and metabolism are affected by temperature and digestion, with fat being formed more rapidly in the outer part of the liver cells. The study provides insights into the complex relationship between temperature, digestion, and fat metabolism in frogs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
