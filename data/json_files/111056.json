Matteucci, conducts experiments to understand the conductibility of nervous matter and the relationship between electricity and nervous force. He finds that nervous filaments cannot act as electroids and that the conductibility of nervous matter is due to the liquid part of the matter itself. He also discovers that the phenomena produced by the passage of an electric current through muscles depend on the direct action of the current on the muscular fiber or the indirect action of the electric current transmitted by the muscular fiber to its own nervous filaments. The author establishes a strict analogy between electricity and nervous force, showing that electricity can develop nervous force and that the direction of the electric current influences the action of nervous force.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
