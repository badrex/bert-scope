It demonstrates that the activation of the HA glycoprotein through proteolytic cleavage is essential for the formation of infectious influenza viruses. The presence of a cleaved HA molecule and an optimal genome composition are necessary for a virus to be pathogenic. The study also shows a correlation between the structure of the haemagglutinin and pathogenicity, with only viruses produced in an infectious form in a wide range of host cells being pathogenic.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
