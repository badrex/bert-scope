The results show that adult rat muscle fibres can form functional synapses with foreign neurons and transformed chromaffin cells, demonstrating their ability to be reinnervated. The efficiency of synapse formation varies between different types of co-cultures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
