The study highlights the greatest barometric variation of 9 tenths of an inch and the highest temperature of 80\u00b0. The author also records the amount of rainfall, the number of rainy days, and the maximum daily rainfall. These observations contribute to understanding the climate of Madeira.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
