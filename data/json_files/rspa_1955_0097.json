They observed anisotropic spectroscopic splitting factors and hyperfine structures in the spectra. The nuclear hyperfine structure was responsible for the principal contribution to the specific heat of each salt. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties and crystal lattice behavior of rare-earth double nitrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
