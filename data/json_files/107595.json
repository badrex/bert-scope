The author used a new method of observation, measuring the difference in declination of a star compared to another star in the same field of view. The results showed that the parallax of the observed stars was very small, indicating that the apparent discrepancies in previous observations were likely due to other factors rather than parallax.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
