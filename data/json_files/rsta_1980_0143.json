The authors explore the use of biological and artificial catalysts, such as chloroplasts, hydrogenase enzymes, and synthetic iron-sulfur particles, to improve the efficiency and stability of hydrogen production. This method has the potential to provide a clean, renewable energy source by using sunlight and water as resources.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Energy and Resources"}
