They also derive an explicit form for the Hohenberg-Kohn universal functional, which is essentially the kinetic energy density. When the spatial variations of density and potential are slow, the usual Thomas-Fermi relation between kinetic energy density and particle density is regained. The approach also leads to a systematic formulation of the gradient expansion of the kinetic energy density.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
