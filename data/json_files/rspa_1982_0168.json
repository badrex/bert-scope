The authors find that a crucial disturbance size exists, which alters the stability properties of the flow field significantly. They analyze the critical layer and wall layers, discovering neutral modes that exist within a specific range of parameters. The findings provide insight into the complex behavior of fluid flow in pipes and contribute to the understanding of fluid dynamics and hydrodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
