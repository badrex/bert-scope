The earthquake was felt in Lincolnshire and neighboring counties, with a rattling noise and trembling sensation lasting for a few minutes. No significant damage was reported, and the event was followed by a violent gust of wind and a noise like thunder. Turnor also mentions the atmospheric conditions, including a thick fog, heavy and close air, and heavy rain. He discusses the similarities between this earthquake and a previous one in 1767 and refers to the hypothesis of the French scientist M. de Mechel, who believed that earthquakes were caused by steam raised by waters in the cavities of the earth suddenly rushing upon subterranean fires.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
