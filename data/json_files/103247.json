Hauksbee conducted experiments to study the effects of compressing multiple atmospheres of air into one space. He found that the compressed air would eventually escape due to heat, and the remaining air would have less space than before. Hauksbee speculated that if more atmospheres were compressed, it might be possible to make invisible substances visible, leading to new discoveries.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas laws"}
