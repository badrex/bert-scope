The dynamic-jump method allows for the direct measurement of attractive forces for distances of separation below the static-jump distance, down to a separation very close to the contact point of the surfaces. This method provides insights into the static-jump method and offers potential for measuring forces in smaller distances of separation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Forces"}
