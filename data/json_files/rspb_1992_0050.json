Trinidad and how it provides evidence for the evolution of anti-predator behavior in the wild. The research shows that inherited behavior patterns, such as schooling and predator inspection, are modified by selection. The findings document inter-drainage differences in behavior that cannot be attributed to variation in the predation regime.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Behavioral Ecology"}
