They found that trapped electrons are formed during irradiation and that these electrons are initially immobilized in cavities surrounded by non-equilibrium solvent molecules. The decay of these trapped electrons is first-order, and their thermal and photolytic destruction is explained by specific reactions. The study provides insights into the radiation-induced processes in glassy alcohols.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiation Chemistry"}
