By reducing the interaction volume, electrical bandwidth, or optical bandwidth, the performance of modulators can be significantly enhanced. The authors demonstrate the potential of this approach through experiments with electro-optic waveguides formed by thermal diffusion of titanium into LiNbO3.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Integrated Optics"}
