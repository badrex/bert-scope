They identified 17 different regions within the area of proliferative activity and analyzed the data for each region separately using a mathematical model for cell proliferation. The main difference between the regions studied was the mean duration of Ol9, the average delay a newborn cell experiences before it begins to synthesize DNA. The quiescent center region had a relatively high proportion of slowly dividing and non-proliferating cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
