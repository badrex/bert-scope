They discovered that gases and vapors absorb and emit heat differently, and the absorption is related to the density and molecular structure of the gas. The author also investigated the connection between absorption, radiation, and conduction, explaining how different materials conduct heat based on their molecular structure and interactions with the surrounding ether.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
