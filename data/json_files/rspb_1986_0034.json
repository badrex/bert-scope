The researchers found that flies can counteract imposed head roll with a high degree of accuracy and speed. They also discovered that flies can modify their wing pitch and wingbeat amplitude to produce a compensatory roll torque, which helps them maintain balance and stability during flight. This ability is advantageous for flying in turbulent air conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Neurobiology"}
