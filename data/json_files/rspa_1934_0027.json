The mean values of 1/<italic>r</italic> and 1/<italic>r</italic><sup>2</sup> are derived, and the expressions for the mean values of 1/<italic>r</italic><sup>4</sup> and 1/<italic>r</italic><sup>6</sup> are also provided. These mean values are useful in atomic spectral terms and the um spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mathematical Physics"}
