The study finds that the relative forced flow tends to become zonal in character when the vessel rotates at a sufficiently high angular velocity. The zonal motion is primarily in the direction of rotation, except near the outer portion of the fluid, where it is in the opposite direction. This phenomenon has significant meteorological implications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
