The author investigates the exchange of angular momentum between the solid and fluid parts of the Earth, as well as the impact of atmospheric fluctuations on the Earth's rotation and polar motion. The study of planetary atmospheres presents challenging problems in the dynamics of rotating fluids, with implications for meteorological and geophysical research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
