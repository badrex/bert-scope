They found that different salts have varying effects on the fluorescence of quinine bisulphate, with some ions, like silver ions, having a more significant impact. The study also showed that non-electrolytes like cane sugar and urea have a minor effect on fluorescence. The findings provide insights into the role of ions and salts in fluorescence and photo sensitization processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
