They conclude that the disintegration and partial solution of ordinary rocks by water at a high temperature account for the gaseous products delivered by springs. The author also discusses the connection between helium in rocks and radioactivity, suggesting that helium may be generated in situ by radioactive change.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
