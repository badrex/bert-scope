The researchers used spectroscopic methods to analyze the protein concentration and Na and Cl concentrations in saliva samples. They found that there is an interrelation between the mechanisms responsible for protein, water, and membrane phenomena secretion, suggesting that these processes depend on the rate at which an activating substance is liberated within the glandular cells during stimulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
