They found that the fluid is clear and colorless, with a faintly alkaline reaction and a specific gravity of about 1005. The fluid contains a globulin and a substance that reduces Fehling's solution, possibly related to pyrocatechin. The authors also investigated the influence of straining, posture, and abdominal compression on the flow and composition of the fluid, confirming previous theories on the relationship between cerebral capillary pressure and vena cava pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurology"}
