They present solutions for different scenarios, including trains of wheels, pulleys, and drums, and discuss the implications of weight reduction in machine design. The study provides valuable insights into optimizing mechanical systems for efficiency and economy.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
