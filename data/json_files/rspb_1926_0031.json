They found that there were not enough morphologically definable Rouget cells to account for capillary contractility. Instead, they discovered that the cells in close proximity to capillaries were connective tissue elements of various types. This challenges the idea that Rouget cells are the primary contractile agents in mammalian capillaries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
