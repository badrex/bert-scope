It shows that the wear rate of the tool is influenced by the total level of residual elements in the steel, which affects the mechanical properties of the workpiece during chip formation. The study supports the view that the wear rate is proportional to the hardness ratio of the workpiece and tool material.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steel Properties"}
