They developed a new actinometer to measure solar intensity, which helped determine the ratio of average intensity at the two stations. The author also discussed the importance of comparing their results with previous experiments and the need for further research on the topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
