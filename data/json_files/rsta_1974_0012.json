It discusses the importance of astronomical chronology and its limitations, such as the lack of veracity in many records, errors in dating events, and uncertainty in calculating the circumstances of ancient eclipses of the Sun. The author reviews recent developments in this study and emphasizes the need for accurate and reliable data to establish a connection between ancient and modern calendars.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
