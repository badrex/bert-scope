The model equations predict the von Karman constant in the law of the wall and provide solutions for various flow situations, such as Coles' wake and jet. The model also incorporates the eddy viscosity and demonstrates how to include viscosity and the interface between turbulent and non-turbulent parts of the flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
