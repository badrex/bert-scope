The authors found that tungsten is more readily attacked by oxygen than platinum and that the adsorption of iodine on platinum is stronger than on tungsten. The study also explores the different modes of heterogeneous actions and their rates of reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
