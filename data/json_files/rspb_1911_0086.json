It shows that ozone causes irritation and inflammation in the lungs, leading to a diminished uptake of oxygen and carbon dioxide output. The study also demonstrates that the effect of ozone is primarily on the lungs, and it supports the idea that the pulmonary epithelium controls the passage of respiratory gases. The research concludes that while ozone can be useful as a deodorizer and freshener, it should be used in concentrations that are barely perceptible to the human nose to avoid potential harm to the respiratory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
