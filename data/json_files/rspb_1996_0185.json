The research finds a positive correlation between contrasts in spermatophylax mass and contrasts in both ampulla mass and sperm number, supporting the ejaculate protection hypothesis. The findings suggest that the large spermatophylax in bushcrickets has evolved to ensure complete sperm transfer during mating.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
