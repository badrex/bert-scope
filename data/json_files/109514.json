He discovered that their essential ingredients include carbonate and phosphate of lime, combined with different modifications of a gelatinous or membranaceous substance. This research also led to a better understanding of the properties and origins of substances like albumen, gelatin, and animal fiber.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
