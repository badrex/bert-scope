They explore the symbolic dynamics, rotation behavior, and knot invariants of these orbits, providing existence and uniqueness results for specific torus knots and links. This research contributes to understanding the topological properties of phase spaces in nonlinear oscillations and dynamical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Topology"}
