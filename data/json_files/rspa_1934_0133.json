The absorption spectra of biological molecules like carotene and vitamin A are measured at liquid air temperatures, revealing differences between the substances. The research also makes progress in separating different molecules in vitamin E concentrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
