The authors present a systematic densitometer mapping of diamagnetic effects on the principal series of Ba and Sr in absorption, with magnetic fields up to 4.7 T. They discuss the differences in intensities and spacings of the n- and -mixed spectra and the shapes of the quasi-Landau resonances in various atomic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
