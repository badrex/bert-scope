They describe the structure and function of the ophthalmicus profundus, oculo-motor, and trigeminal nerves, providing a detailed analysis of their origins, branches, and roles in the nervous system of these fish. This study sheds light on the differences and similarities between the cranial nerves of various Elasmobranch species and contributes to the understanding of vertebrate neuroanatomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate anatomy"}
