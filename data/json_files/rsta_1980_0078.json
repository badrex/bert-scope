It explores the interactions between various elements and their effects on the properties of materials during hot working. The author also examines the role of molten phases in the development of hot short behavior and the impact of various oxidizing atmospheres on enrichment processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Steelmaking"}
