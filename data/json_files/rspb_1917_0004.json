The toxic action is most potent when the concentration of salt is between 0.85% and 0.9%. The author also found that the toxic effect can be counteracted by adding a small amount of a bivalent salt, such as calcium chloride, with or without potassium chloride. This research helps in understanding the behavior of meningococci and developing potential treatments for meningitis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
