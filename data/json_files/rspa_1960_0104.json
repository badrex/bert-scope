They developed a technique to deduce ionospheric velocities from the motion of the diffraction pattern on the ground. The study found that ionospheric drifts were predominantly towards the east during the day and towards the west in the evening, with a reversal in direction at around 0030 L.M.T. These findings correlated well with previous measurements of auroral forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
