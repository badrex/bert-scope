It finds that the presence of folds increases local depolarization at the top of the interfold, leading to the activation of more sodium channels in the postsynaptic membrane. This amplification of neuromuscular transmission can result in excitation spreading to the remainder of the muscle with fewer quanta required compared to the absence of folds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
