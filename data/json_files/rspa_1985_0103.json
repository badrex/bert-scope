The author applies a rigorous mathematical treatment to a circular harbour with a small entrance and finds that the magnitude of resonance due to a single frequency increases slowly (logarithmically) as the harbour entrance decreases in size. The results agree with the work of J. Miles and the problem is equivalent to a two-dimensional sound-wave problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
