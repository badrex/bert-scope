They found that the hypothesis that elements are simple bodies does not explain all the phenomena observed. The author suggests that some elements might be compound bodies and presents a new hypothesis based on the differentiation of phenomena on two hypotheses.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Elemental composition and compounds"}
