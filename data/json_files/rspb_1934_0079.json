The research confirms the correlation between the ratio of sodium to diffusible calcium in blood and the ratio of solids-not-fat to fat in milk, which may play a significant role in the differences in milk composition among various breeds. The findings emphasize the importance of further investigation into the fundamental permeability relationships involved in milk formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
