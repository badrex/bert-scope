The cloth was exposed to fire and did not burn, even when oil was poured on it while red-hot. The cloth's fire-resistant properties were confirmed in multiple experiments, leading to further investigation and discussion within the scientific community.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Textiles"}
