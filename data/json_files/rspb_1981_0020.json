Using operant methods and preference tests, it was found that both sheep and calves prefer light to darkness. The strength of their motivation for light was tested by rewarding them with only 40 seconds of light for each interruption of an infrared beam. The results show that sheep and calves are motivated to work for light and have a clear preference for illuminated environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
