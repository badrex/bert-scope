They found that the critical points of these mixtures were affected by the presence of impurities, such as air. The authors also observed that the tensions of the saturated vapor in the mixtures were influenced by the impurities, which affected the accuracy of the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
