The crystal structure revealed significant bond alternation, which contradicts the idea of aromaticity in the calicene system. The study provides insights into the molecular and crystal structure of this compound, contributing to the understanding of its properties and reactivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
