The results show that the carbon sheets in these compounds are planar, and the binding of fluorine to carbon is highly ionic. The study also reveals that the carbon atom sheets are similar to those in pristine graphite, and the compounds exhibit strong interactions with hydrogen fluoride (HF).", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid State Chemistry"}
