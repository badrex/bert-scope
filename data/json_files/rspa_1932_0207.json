They discovered that the reaction can be initiated by a hot surface and is accompanied by luminescence. The rate of the reaction is independent of oxygen concentration, and the product, sulfur dioxide, acts as an inhibitor, stopping the reaction if not removed quickly.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas-phase chemistry"}
