Researchers used radio exploration methods to study the ionosphere's reflection, refraction, and absorption of wireless waves. They found that the ionosphere's ionization is influenced by solar radiation, the earth's magnetic field, and other factors such as thunderstorms and charged particles from the sun.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
