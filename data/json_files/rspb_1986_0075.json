Mice fed a 2% protein diet maintained body weight and accumulated adult worms in direct proportion to exposure, while those fed an 8% protein diet developed a partly effective immunity to reinfection, reducing worm survival and fecundity. The results demonstrate that host nutritional status can influence helminth infection dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
