The author highlights the advancements in endoscopic technology, particularly the Hopkins solid rod lens system, which has enabled the creation of smaller, more efficient telescopes for use inside the human brain. This new technique has led to the establishment of a new branch of neurosurgery, offering improved access to the cerebral cortex and allowing for a range of surgical procedures within the brain's ventricles.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Neurosurgery"}
