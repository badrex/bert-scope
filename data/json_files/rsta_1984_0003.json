It discusses the forward and inverse approaches in source-magma relations and evaluates petrological and geophysical processes in layered mantle and subduction zones. The study highlights the limitations of models that derive basalts from deep mantle reservoirs and the importance of considering mantle peridotite, subducted oceanic crust, and continental crust in the formation of calc-alkaline magmas.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
