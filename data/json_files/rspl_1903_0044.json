They allowed the salt solution to drop into the vessel, forcing the water upwards and out through a pipe. By analyzing the density of each stratum, they plotted a curve to determine the diffusion rate. This method allowed for a more accurate understanding of the diffusion process and its impact on salt solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
