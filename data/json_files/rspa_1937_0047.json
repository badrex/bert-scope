They test the method on a series of metals and alloys, comparing the results with those obtained using visual light systems. The study demonstrates that ultra-violet radiation can provide higher resolution of metal microstructures, opening up new possibilities for research in materials science and metallurgy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
