They found that the dependence between the diameter and depth of the craters is nearly linear for certain values. The large walled plains do not follow this dependence, likely due to lava flooding. The study helps in understanding the Moon's geological features and comparing observational results with computational models.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Lunar Geology"}
