The method involves inscribing an equilateral triangle in a hexagon and bisecting its sides. By drawing parallel lines and folding the resulting trapeziums, a hexagonal prism is formed that accommodates three lozenges, replicating the structure of a honey bee's cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Biology and Life Sciences > Honey Bee Biology"}
