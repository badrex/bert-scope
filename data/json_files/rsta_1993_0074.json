The authors found that increasing organic loading led to predictable increases in anoxic processes, such as denitrification. The model predicted that deeper organic matter degradation could increase oxygen penetration, the C02/02 ratio, and nitrification and denitrification rates. The study highlights the importance of understanding sedimentary geochemical processes for predicting nutrient availability and the potential for future fossil fuel sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Biogeochemistry"}
