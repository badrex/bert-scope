The method involves dividing the domain into sub-intervals and finding a local average of the function in each interval. The author demonstrates that this approach can provide accurate approximations with controlled error, making it a valuable tool for studying Sturm-Liouville series.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
