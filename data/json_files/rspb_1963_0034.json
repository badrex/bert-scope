They find that the denaturing effect of y-rays is proportional to the concentration of DNA and is inhibited by substances that react with free radicals. The study also shows that y-rays are less effective in the presence of chloride than fluoride ions, suggesting that DNA is attacked by more reactive hydroxyl radicals in fluoride solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
