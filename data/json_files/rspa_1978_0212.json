The study takes into account surface effects and derives expressions for the effects of dielectric composition on the inner potential difference between the plates. The findings provide a better understanding of the thermodynamics of condensers and the relationship between electrostatic and other forces at microscopic separations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
