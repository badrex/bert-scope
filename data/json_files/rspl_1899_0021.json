They discovered that when metals are strained, slip bands form along the cleavage or gliding planes in the crystals, which demonstrates the persistence of the crystalline structure even after plastic deformation. This research also showed how the crystalline structure is consistent with plasticity and how it persists after plastic strain has occurred.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
