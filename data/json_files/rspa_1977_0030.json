The authors rework the problem and evaluate the numerical values of the dimensionless mean velocity, mean skin friction, and mean temperature. They find that the mean temperature profiles in the previous paper are incorrect and present the correct values in this note.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
