He found that the heat generated by the friction of liquids and gases is proportional to the force applied, confirming the relationship between mechanical force and heat. Joule's work contributed to the understanding of the conversion between energy forms and laid the foundation for the development of the law of conservation of energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
