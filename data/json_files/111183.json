He observed fringes of colors in both reflection and refraction, and discussed the similarities and differences between them. Brougham also examined the effects of transparent plates on light rays, and the phenomenon of fringes of interference in shadows. His findings contribute to the understanding of light and its interactions with different materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
