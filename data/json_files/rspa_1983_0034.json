They found that dislocations with Burgers vector on (111) glide planes were dissociated into two Shockley partials, with separations between 2.5 and 4.3. The stacking fault energy was determined from the mean and distribution of the partials' separations. The behavior of dislocations in diamond appears to be similar to that in germanium and silicon.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
