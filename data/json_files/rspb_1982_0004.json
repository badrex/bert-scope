Both procedures result in nerve regeneration, but cut lesions show less successful axon regeneration and a slower recovery rate. The research also examines the functional changes in the somatosensory cortex and trigeminal nucleus, showing that nerve-cut animals have more significant abnormalities and a longer recovery time compared to nerve-crushed animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
