They find that the ice contains varying amounts of chlorine, lime, magnesia, and sulfuric acid. The melting point of sea-water ice is also determined, showing that salt exists in the ice in both solid and liquid forms. This research sheds light on the chemical composition of sea-water ice and its formation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
