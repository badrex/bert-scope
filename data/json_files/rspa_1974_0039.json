The size distribution of quartz particles in the cores, along with mineralogy, biological data, and carbonate content, suggests that trade winds were more vigorous during glacial stages. This research provides insights into past climate conditions and the impact of trade winds on global climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
