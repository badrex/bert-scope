The researchers found that Chlorella cells can take up leucine through a high-affinity transport mechanism and incorporate it into proteins. The study also shows that the uptake of leucine by Chlorella cells in the intact symbiosis occurs in two stages, with the first stage being more rapid than the second. The results suggest that amino acids may play a role in supplying nitrogen to the symbionts and regulating Chlorella cell growth and division.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis and Nutrient Transport"}
