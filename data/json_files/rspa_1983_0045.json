The author formulates the problem and presents a quasistatic solution for the inner region of the slab. The study also explores the effective boundary conditions for thin slabs and provides a method to determine the reflexion and transmission constants in the long wave asymptotic limit.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromagnetic and Microwave Engineering"}
