They discover that every odd number can be divided into four squares with two equal roots and two roots that differ by 1, 2, 3, or more. The author also introduces two series of numbers with specific properties related to the differences between the roots of the squares. These findings can be used to investigate various mathematical relations among the roots of the four squares into which numbers may be divided.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
