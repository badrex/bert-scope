The author describes the taxonomy, distribution, and intermediate host capacity of these snails, which are important for their role in transmitting blood-flukes of the genus Schistosoma to humans and domestic animals. The study also highlights the challenges in understanding the taxonomy of these snails and their parasites due to the paucity and unreliability of morphological criteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
