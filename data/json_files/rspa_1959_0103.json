They compared their results with the predictions of the isobar theory of pion production, which postulates that pion production occurs through an intermediate state of isotopic spin. The results for positive pion production agreed with this hypothesis, while the results for neutral pion production did not align with the isobar theory predictions. This study provided better statistical accuracy for energy spectra and particle correlations in proton-proton interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
