They also describe a new method for detecting molecular changes in electrically conducting liquids and suggest the use of this method for discovering anomalous molecular alterations. Additionally, the author presents evidence for the existence of several additional metals in the sun's atmosphere through spectroscopic analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
