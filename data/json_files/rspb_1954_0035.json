They found that ferrets with divided pituitary stalks could still respond to artificial light, suggesting that light-induced estrus is not dependent on the integrity of the pituitary-portal vessels or direct hypothalamic innervation of the pars distalis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
