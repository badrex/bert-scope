They analyze the factors affecting the selection of sample types, sample preparation, and analytical procedures. Stream sediment is found to be the optimum sample type for upland Britain, while soils are better for areas of intensive agriculture. Geochemical mapping provides valuable information on chemical variations in bedrock, but challenges in relating geochemical or biological activity to total trace element values must be considered. The authors also examine the geochemical maps of the North Sea, noting that trace element levels are generally low, with higher concentrations near coastal areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
