They found that bacteria have varying levels of sensitivity to different wavelengths of ultra-violet light, and that exposure to certain wavelengths can significantly reduce bacterial growth. The study also introduced a new technique for measuring bacterial growth using a photoelectric effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
