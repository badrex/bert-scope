The author demonstrates that anole communities on islands like Jamaica and Puerto Rico have similar structures and have evolved through nearly identical sequences of ancestral communities. The driving force behind this adaptive radiation is believed to be interspecific competition. The habitat specialization hypothesis is tested, suggesting that the addition of new species to a community leads to shifts in habitat use, which can result in morphological adaptations. The author's experimental findings support the existence of ecological interactions among sympatric anoles and the role of habitat shifts in their evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
