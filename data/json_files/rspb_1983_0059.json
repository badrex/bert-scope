The research focuses on the process of phagocytosis and how it relates to the establishment of intracellular symbiosis. The findings suggest that specificity in symbiosis is regulated by processes that occur after potential algal symbionts are phagocytosed, rather than through initial cellular recognition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis and Mutualism"}
