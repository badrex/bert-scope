It explores the use of computer-based systems for preliminary ship design and production of control tapes for plate definition and cutting. The author outlines techniques for real integration of design and production, focusing on structural design, and suggests ways to extend integration to meet the needs of the 1980s. The goal is to make the design and production process more efficient and flexible, allowing for rapid exploration of alternative designs and maximizing the capabilities of the system.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Shipbuilding Technology"}
