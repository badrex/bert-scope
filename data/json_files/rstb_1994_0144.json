Computer simulations show that parasites can lead to the accumulation of diverse clones, which can competitively exclude sexual subpopulations. Additionally, parasites and inbreeding depression can interact to select for evolutionarily stable reproductive strategies involving mixtures of selfed and outcrossed progeny.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
