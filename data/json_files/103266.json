He explained that the ice forms from melted snow that falls on the mountain's top, which is covered with snow all year round. The snow melts in the summer and falls to the bottom, where it freezes due to the lack of sunlight. Burnet also mentioned that the ice mountain increases every seven years and decreases in the following seven years, though he doubts the accuracy of this observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
