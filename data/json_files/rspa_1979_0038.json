They propose an approximate solution scheme for the relaxation of two homogeneous plasmas at different temperatures and compare it with a conventional numerical scheme. The Landau equation cannot be used in a finite difference solution starting from infinity, so a series expansion is needed to begin the integration. The limits of integration in the equation must be restricted, and the author examines the reasons for this.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
