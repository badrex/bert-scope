They found that the electrical discharge is a vital action dependent on the fish's life and voluntary action. Frequent use of the electrical organs can be injurious to the fish, and the nerves of the electrical organs play a crucial role in the discharge. The author also observed that the fish's voluntary power over the electrical organ may be related to the effects of castration in animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
