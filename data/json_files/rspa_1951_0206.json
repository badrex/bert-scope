The study investigates the lift, wave drag, and normal force coefficients, as well as the center of pressure, for various aspect ratios and Mach numbers. The experimental results are compared with theoretical predictions, showing fair agreement, particularly at lower aspect ratios. The effects of the boundary layer on the tunnel wall are also considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aerodynamics"}
