The authors found that power stations destabilize temperature patterns, increase natural annual temperature ranges, and affect invertebrate communities. They also observed that some fish species can withstand sudden temperature fluctuations. The River Trent, which is used for cooling by 14 power stations, shows significant pollution effects on its invertebrate fauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
