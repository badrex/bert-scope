They argue that these models are not distinct and can be considered as one type of handicap, which is condition-dependent. The author discusses the implications of this finding for understanding the evolution of male ornaments and the importance of the handicap mechanism in sexual selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
