The bleeding occurred around the full moon and was often accompanied by a small amount of pain. The man stopped the haemorrhage by searing the affected area with a hot iron. However, this led to other health problems, including a cough, colic, and a disposition to these conditions. The author argues that this case provides evidence against the idea that the menstrual cycle is caused by a local ferment in the uterus.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Hematology"}
