The author compares the properties of these particles with those of -particles found in photographic emulsions and provides a provisional interpretation of the data. The study includes the lifetimes, masses, and decay processes of these particles, as well as the nature of the neutral secondaries produced by their decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
