Techniques such as optical diffraction, Fourier transforms, and optical filtering are explored, along with three-dimensional reconstruction methods using Fourier synthesis. These methods help in understanding the arrangement and shape of macromolecules in biological specimens with high resolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microscopy and Imaging"}
