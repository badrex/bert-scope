The most prevalent bacterium found was Citrobacter, present in 17 out of 19 individual reptiles. The study also found that Citrobacter species from reptiles were more resistant to chloramphenicol than those from mammals. The research compared the bacterial flora of reptiles and mammals, finding that reptiles had a higher prevalence of Citrobacter and Pseudomonas, and a lower prevalence of E. coli."}
