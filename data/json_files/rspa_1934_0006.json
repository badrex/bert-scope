They improved the accuracy of the energy measurements and compared the results with the a-ray measurements to determine the nuclear level systems of these radioactive elements. The study provides valuable information about the excitation energy of the nucleus and the connection between y-ray energies and a-ray energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
