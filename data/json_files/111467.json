W. Hofmann, discusses his research on poly-ammonias and their derivatives. He explains how ammonia can replace hydrogen in organic bases, leading to the formation of compound ammoniums. Hofmann also explores the relationship between ammonia and bi-acid alcohols, which can produce bi-ammonium bases. He examines the work of other chemists, such as M. Cloez and M. Wurtz, and presents his findings on the molecular construction of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
