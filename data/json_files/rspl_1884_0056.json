They found that this hydroid phase is likely a part of the life cycle of Limnocodium, which belongs to the Trachomedusae group. The authors suggest that further study of the hydroid phase may reveal more about the life cycle and the relationship between this organism and its environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Hydrozoa"}
