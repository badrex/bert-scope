They discovered a new model for spermine complexation to poly(dG-dC) that involves reorientation of spermine through specific ligand-base pair hydrogen bond formation. This model explains the observed experimental differences in binding to these two helices and provides insights into the role of solvent in differentiating the binding modes. The findings contribute to understanding the mechanisms of polyamines in cellular processes such as cell growth and replication."}
