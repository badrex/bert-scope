He discovered that when two perspective projections of the same object are presented to each eye, the mind perceives a single, three-dimensional figure. Wheatstone also invented the stereoscope, an instrument that allows for the accurate representation of 3D objects by combining the two separate images from each eye.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
