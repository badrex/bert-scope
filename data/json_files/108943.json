They describe the process of ossification and bone formation in the ostrich skull, as well as the differences in skull development between birds and other vertebrates. The study also highlights the importance of understanding the ostrich skull as a key to understanding the evolution of vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Anatomy"}
