The author explores two topics: free radicals in radiation-induced oxidation of high polymers and free radicals during liquid-phase polymerization of monomers. ESR provides valuable information on reaction mechanisms, radical concentrations, and steric structures of radicals, which can help improve our understanding of polymer degradation and formation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
