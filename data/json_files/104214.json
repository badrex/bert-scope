He used a 24-foot telescope and recorded the event's details, including the time, position, and the planet's path. Winthrop's observations helped determine Mercury's longitude and latitude, contributing to the understanding of celestial mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
