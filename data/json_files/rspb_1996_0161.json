Infected minnows exhibit increased nearest neighbor distances and deviant positioning within schools, which may increase their susceptibility to certain predators and have consequences for parasite transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology", "sub_discipline": "Fish Behavior and Ecology"}
