The authors construct an interaction potential at short range and use the close-coupling formulation to assess the reliability of the fixed-nuclei approximation. They also examine two simplified close-coupling methods and find that they can provide results of useful accuracy. The study is relevant to understanding the physical conditions in interstellar clouds and the formation of protostars.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
