They describe the plant's medullary axis, exogenous zone, phloem zone, and cortex, providing detailed observations and illustrations of their findings. This research contributes to the understanding of plant life during the Carboniferous period.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
