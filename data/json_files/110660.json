P. Gassiot, conducted experiments to determine if a spark could be obtained before the circuit of a Voltaic Battery was completed. Using various setups and batteries, Gassiot was unable to produce a spark until the circuit was fully closed. However, he successfully obtained direct sparks and chemical decompositions with a modified apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
