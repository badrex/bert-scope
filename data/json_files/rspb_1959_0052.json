Mice of strains A, A2G, and C57BL were bred at three different temperatures: 21\u00b0C, 10\u00b0C, and -3\u00b0C. The results showed that mice breeding performance was significantly affected by low temperatures, with higher mortality rates and delayed breeding onset. The study highlights the importance of understanding the effects of cold environments on reproduction in mice.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproduction and Development"}
