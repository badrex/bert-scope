They used a paddle in a suspended water vessel to measure the heat produced and the work done, leading to a more accurate measurement of the mechanical equivalent of heat. This research contributed to the understanding of energy conversion and conservation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
