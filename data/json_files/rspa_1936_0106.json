They found that the L energy levels are not dependent on the magnetic state of the metals, and the Moseley diagrams of the M levels show a change in slope for elements with atomic numbers 24 to 35. The study also revealed that the L levels and positions of the M levels are not dependent on the magnetic state of the elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
