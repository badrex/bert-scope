They discovered similarities between the absorption bands in planetary spectra and those of water, suggesting that water may play a significant role in the atmospheres of these planets. However, they were unable to identify the cause of certain unidentified absorption bands in the green region of the spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
