The authors describe various surface modifications and promoters that enable rapid, reversible, and productive binding of proteins to the electrode, allowing for better understanding of electron transfer processes in vivo and the design of devices for specific substrate transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
