They discovered that the crystal structure of spinel has a new symmetry, which provides a significantly better fit to the experimental data and resolves inconsistencies in the physical properties of spinel materials. This new symmetry could help improve our understanding of spinel's behavior and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
