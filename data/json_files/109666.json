The authors conducted experiments to determine the amount of oxygen consumed and carbon dioxide produced during respiration. They found that the average consumption of oxygen is 32.3 inches per minute, and the average formation of carbon dioxide is 37 inches per minute. The study also showed that no other gases, such as hydrogen, are released during respiration, and that the amount of nitrogen gas remains unchanged.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Respiration and Gas Exchange"}
