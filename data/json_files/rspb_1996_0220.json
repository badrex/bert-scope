By using a nonlinear-prediction technique, they test for temporal directionality and identify whether erratic fluctuations in a time series are generated by a linear Gaussian process or involve nonlinear dynamics. The method is tested on various model and real ecological time series, providing insights into the presence of nonlinearity and chaos in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Statistics and Data Analysis"}
