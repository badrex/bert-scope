They propose a series-parallel model of the sodium channel, which incorporates four similar voltage sensors that operate in parallel. Activation results from conformational changes brought about by these voltage sensors, while inactivation is a potential-dependent process involving a third transition of a specific voltage sensor. This model helps explain the delay in opening and the voltage dependence of inactivation in these channels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
