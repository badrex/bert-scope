They discovered that there are two types of conduction mechanisms: one through the wood, as proposed by Ricca, and another, faster form of conduction over a short distance in the phloem and cambium region. This research helps to understand the differences in conduction mechanisms between stem and leaf tissues in Mimosa pudica.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
