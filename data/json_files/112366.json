Norman Lockyer, describes his spectroscopic observations of the Sun and discovers the chromosphere, a gaseous envelope surrounding the Sun. He also determines that prominences are local aggregations within this envelope and suggests the term \"chromosphere\" to differentiate it from the Sun's photosphere and outer corona. The author also discusses the variability of spectral lines and the possibility of chromospheres being a part of star-economy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
