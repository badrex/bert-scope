The researchers observed the formation of slip bands, which are lines of deformation along planes of cleavage, and how these bands change the surface's appearance and properties. The study provides insight into the behavior of metals under stress and the underlying mechanisms of deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallography"}
