It examines the prevalence of diseases, including malaria and nutritional deficiencies, and compares the health standards of the two communities. The study found that chronic degenerative diseases were uncommon in both locations, while malaria and anaemia were more prevalent in Karkar due to its warm, humid climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Epidemiology"}
