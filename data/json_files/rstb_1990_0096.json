The research found that while cognitive performance deteriorated over time, performance on the complex system remained stable. The findings suggest that designing systems with a focus on ergonomics and user interactions can help maintain performance during extended periods of sleep deprivation.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Human Factors"}
