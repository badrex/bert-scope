They discovered that substances like adrenaline, strychnine, and morphine can be distributed throughout the body via a peripheral mechanism, which may play a role in local actions, pathological conditions, and organs with limited circulation. This research provides insights into alternative distribution mechanisms in living organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Lymphatic System"}
