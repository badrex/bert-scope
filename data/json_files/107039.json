He discovered that shells are primarily composed of carbonate of lime, while bones contain a larger portion of a more viscous gelatinous substance. Hatchett also observed that shells composed of nacre or mother of pearl have a layered structure with each layer being a membrane coated with a layer of carbonate of lime. This research helped to understand the composition and formation of shells and bones.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
