They found that the decay rate is influenced by solvent viscosity and temperature. The results showed two distinct regimes of triplet decay: a high viscosity regime where the rate is nearly independent of temperature and viscosity, and a low viscosity regime where diffusion-controlled quenching processes are operative. The authors used flash photolysis to investigate these processes at low temperatures, linking their findings to previous studies in rigid glasses and crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
