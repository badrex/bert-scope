The study finds that the diurnal inequality's vanishing time is six days after its cause vanishes, and the solar inequality's effects agree with the equilibrium theory. The author emphasizes the need for a more accurate mathematical solution for the motion of fluids to better understand tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
