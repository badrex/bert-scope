They found that there is a decrease in terrestrial magnetic action with an increase in height, both in terms of secular variation of declination and horizontal force, and diurnal inequality of horizontal force. This study helps to understand the Earth's magnetic field better.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
