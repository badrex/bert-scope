It describes the characteristics of the chloroplasts, including their resistance to physical abrasion and high osmotic pressure. The research also explores how Elysia viridis selects Codium fragile, its host food plant, and the differences in chloroplast rates of carbon fixation in various regions of the plant. The study concludes that Elysia viridis can select Codium in the presence of other seaweeds and moves towards light intensities of up to 12 W m-2 while avoiding intensities above 24 W m-2.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Behavior"}
