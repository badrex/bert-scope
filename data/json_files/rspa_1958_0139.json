The method uses new types of expansions and allows for the calculation of critical Taylor numbers, which determine the point at which instability sets in for the assigned parameters. The author provides detailed numerical results for the case when the ratio of the radii of the cylinders is one-half.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
