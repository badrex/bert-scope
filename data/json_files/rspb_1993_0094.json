The results showed that male chaffinches with bright colors were more likely to be attacked by sparrowhawks, while in the case of pied flycatchers, the conspicuous males were less likely to be attacked. This suggests that predation risk can influence the evolution of male bird coloration differently in various species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
