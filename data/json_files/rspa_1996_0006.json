They discovered that the growth rate is always complex in the anisotropic situation, leading to an oscillatory instability at the onset of convection. This novel finding is different from the Boussinesq situation and has implications for real-life situations involving anisotropic porous media.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
