The analysis, which considers large Prandtl number flows, reveals a double structure in the boundary layers, with outer layers being convection-dominated. The findings have implications for understanding mass flux and the overall flow structure within the cavity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
