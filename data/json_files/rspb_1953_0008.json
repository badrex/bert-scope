They discovered that diepoxybutane produced lethal, semi-lethal, and visible mutations, including neoplastic melanotic tumors in the offspring of treated flies. This research contributes to the understanding of the relationship between mutagenesis and carcinogenesis and the potential role of mutations in cancer development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
