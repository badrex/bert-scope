They used a \"black body\" apparatus to measure the radiation emitted by the metals and found that the emissivity of copper and silver differs significantly from that of a full radiator. The emissivity of solid and liquid copper was measured and compared, revealing a discontinuity at the melting point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
