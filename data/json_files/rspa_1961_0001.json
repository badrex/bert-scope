The authors find that these forces can be locally additive, meaning they can be represented as double sums over localized regions in each molecule, but only if the electron correlation within each molecule decays rapidly with distance. The authors also provide examples of both locally additive and non-additive behavior in molecular interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
