Stukeley, examines the causes of earthquakes and challenges the common belief that they are caused by subterranean vapors and eruptions. He argues that the extent and lack of visible effects of earthquakes make this explanation unlikely. Stukeley also considers the role of springs and fountains in the Earth's structure and suggests that the idea of subterranean fires causing earthquakes is unconvincing. He proposes that a deeper understanding of the Earth's internal processes is needed to explain the phenomenon of earthquakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
