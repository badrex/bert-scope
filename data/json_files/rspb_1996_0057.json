Autoradiographic investigations show that a specific section of the oviduct selects which sperm will reach the ovary. Sperm may be blocked and destroyed in this region, resulting in female control of paternity. This reproductive strategy is different from the well-studied compound ascidian Botryllus schlosseri.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
