It presents the Swedish research on a repository 500 meters deep in crystalline rock, focusing on the canister's safety effect and comparing it with other barriers available in a repository system. The study concludes that a combined protection effect of natural and man-made barriers can be achieved, providing a safe and long-term solution for radioactive waste management.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Nuclear Engineering"}
