The research examines the effects of total or partial removal of the pituitary gland and the influence of normal factors affecting color change on the metabolism of this species. The findings provide insights into the relationship between the pituitary gland and metabolism, as well as the role of muscle tone as an intermediary agent.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
