The spatial distribution of this parameter results from the interaction of components of retinal axons and tectal components. The model can explain the generation of primary projections and some features of regulation, such as independence of projections on neural pathways and observations on the innervation of rotated pieces of tectum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neural Development"}
