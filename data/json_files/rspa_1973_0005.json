They created topographic maps to show the variation of electronic lifetimes over the Fermi surface due to the presence of different impurities. This method allowed them to directly measure local values of the electronic lifetimes and understand the scattering behavior of electrons in gold.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
