The synthesis aimed to create a substance with a formula similar to adrenalin, which had been isolated from the suprarenal gland. The synthesized substance exhibited similar physiological effects as adrenalin, suggesting a close structural relationship between the two substances. However, the author also notes that further research is needed to determine the exact structure of the synthesized substance and its relationship to adrenalin.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
