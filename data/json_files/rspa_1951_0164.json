They correlated the intensity with the polar properties of the nitrogen-nitrogen and nitrogen-oxygen links and discussed the general relationship between integrated band area and total pressure. This study provides more information about the relationships involved when nitrous oxide's vibration bands are pressure-broadened by adding gases like nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
