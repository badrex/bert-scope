He compares the time taken by various travelers between different locations, such as Aleppo, Bagdad, and Bussorah, to determine the consistency of camel travel rates. This information can be used to create a more accurate scale for geographical mapping and understanding of the African continent.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geography"}
