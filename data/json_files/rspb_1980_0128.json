It speculates on the reasons for the existence of these peptides and their functions in various cell types. The author also highlights recent discoveries of Met-enkephalin in different cell locations and the distinct patterns of abnormality in multiple peptide production by endocrine tumors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
