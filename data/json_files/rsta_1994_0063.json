The author discusses the mathematical models and methods used to solve this problem, including the critical line algorithm. The article also explores the applications of this theory in real-world financial scenarios and the importance of considering constraints such as budget, turnover, and exogenous assets.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Optimization"}
