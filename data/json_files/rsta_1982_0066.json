They conclude that these inhomogeneities cause seismic wave scattering, which can be observed as precursors to the seismic phase PKIKP. The detailed characteristics of these precursors provide information about the distribution and characteristics of the inhomogeneities near the core-mantle boundary, which is important for understanding the geodynamical processes occurring inside the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
