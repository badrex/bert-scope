The results show that X-ray exposure reduces sulfate uptake in cartilage, and replacing air with nitrogen can decrease the radiation's impact. Some substances, like L-cysteine, can protect against the radiation's effects. The findings contribute to understanding the effects of ionizing radiation on mucopolysaccharide secretion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Radiation Biology"}
