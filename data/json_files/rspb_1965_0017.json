The researchers found that calcium ions directly increase the release of the neurotransmitter, rather than indirectly affecting it by facilitating nerve impulse propagation or increasing the amplitude of the terminal nerve spike. This discovery helps to understand the importance of calcium ions in neuromuscular transmission.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
