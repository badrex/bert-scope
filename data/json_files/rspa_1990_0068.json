They study the behavior of the system through two ordinary differential equations and find that it exhibits a range of phenomena, such as oscillation, multistability, and homoclinic bifurcation. This model provides a qualitative understanding of the complexity of phenomena that can occur in wet combustion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
