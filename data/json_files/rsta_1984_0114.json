The authors discuss the dynamic response of nematic substances to an applied laser field and the potential applications of liquid crystals in nonlinear optics, such as optical bistability in Fabry-Perot interferometers. They also mention the possibility of using liquid crystals to study bifurcation and chaos in all-optical systems."}
