He introduces the idea of colloids and crystalloids, and explains how they can be separated through processes like dialysis. Graham also describes a method of separation using a column of water and a gelatinous septum, which allows for the isolation of substances based on their diffusive power.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
