They explore the properties of Milner's -numbers, including conversion of matrices, summed transformations, group and tensor properties, product formula, and invariant scalars. The study also introduces a new interpretation of tensor theory and discusses the existence of quadratic invariants in finite algebras.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
