Researchers found that mice fed a low-protein diet had higher parasite intensity and increased host mortality, while well-nourished mice had lower worm burdens and higher host survival. The results suggest that malnourished mice are more susceptible to intestinal worm infections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
