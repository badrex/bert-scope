This expansion is an extension of a theorem by Olver, who obtained an analogue for Fourier transforms of Watson's lemma for Laplace transforms. The method used in this paper relies on results on Laplace transforms and a novel technique to handle the appearance of divergent integrals in such problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
