The authors find that many-body effects can significantly impact the equation of state for hot dense fluids, such as detonation products, and may be responsible for discrepancies between theoretical and experimental data. Monte Carlo simulations of dense helium demonstrate the importance of three-body forces in these systems, suggesting that further investigation of more complex many-body interactions is necessary for accurate modeling of detonation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
