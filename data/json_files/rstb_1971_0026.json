The main findings reveal that birds had the highest prevalence of blood parasites, with Haemoproteus and Plasmodium species being the most common. Reptiles and mammals had fewer instances of blood parasites, and no exoerythrocytic stages of any protozoan parasite were detected. The study suggests that these parasites do not cause obvious mortality or disease, but their potential impact on young birds during breeding season is still unknown.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
