They find that each gas has a highly specific effect on the cohering action, which is in agreement with the known phenomena of adsorption of gases at solid surfaces. The author also discovers that the energy of desorption of the gas film can be calculated from the critical voltage required to remove the film and bring about metallic contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Contact Physics"}
