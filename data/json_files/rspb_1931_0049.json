They find that all species and varieties in the group have a basic chromosome number of 17 and are orthoploid, meaning they have 34, 51, or 68 chromosomes. The author also observes a high degree of similarity in chromosome behavior during meiosis, with some abnormalities and secondary pairing occurring. Triploid and tetraploid forms were found to be auto-polyploids, meaning they arise from the functioning of an unreduced gamete in a normal diploid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Biology"}
