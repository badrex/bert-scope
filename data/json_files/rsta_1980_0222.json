The research focuses on komatiites, a type of ultramafic rock, and their geochemistry, which can provide insights into the chemical evolution of the Earth's mantle. The study compares Archaean komatiites with younger high-magnesian lavas, analyzing their elemental ratios and the factors that influence their composition, such as melting, residue nature, and tectonic settings.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
