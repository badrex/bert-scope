Herschel, conducted experiments to study the effects of electric currents on fluid conductors, particularly mercury. They observed various motions and phenomena in the mercury, such as currents, eddies, and attractions to the negative pole. The author explained these phenomena by analyzing the internal currents and the interactions between the mercury and the surrounding acid. This research contributed to the understanding of electricity and its effects on conductive fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
