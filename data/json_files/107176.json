He observes that Saturn's figure is not spherical like Jupiter's and that its curvature is greatest at a latitude of about 45 degrees. He also discusses the challenges of accurately measuring the planet's figure and the differences in the appearance of Saturn and Jupiter through a telescope.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Science"}
