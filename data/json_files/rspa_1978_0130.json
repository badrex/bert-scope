The authors construct the Green functions for these fields in a cosmological model that describes the rapid expansion of the universe. They find that the absence of backscattering is a property of these functions, and the initial-value problem for each field can be solved in a closed form. The results have implications for the behavior of electrons and the nature of Huygens' principle in the early universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
