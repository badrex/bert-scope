The authors found that hydroperoxyl participates in the flame mechanism, and the main reactions in the flame are (i), (ii), (iii), (iv), and (xv). The results show that the interplay between these reactions makes it impossible to use the atmospheric pressure flame for an independent, precise determination of the hydrogen-oxygen chain branching-rate constant.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
