Ovorubin has a high stability to denaturation and is partially utilized during egg development. The carotenoid component is likely an ester or ether of astaxanthin, and the carbohydrate component represents about 20% of the molecule. The carotenoid and glycoprotein can be separated and recombined, and the carotenoid is believed to stabilize the protein structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
