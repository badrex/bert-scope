The authors found that higher temperatures decrease the duration of muscle contractions, making slower shortenings less effective. However, higher temperatures also reduce muscle viscosity, allowing for greater effectiveness at higher speeds of shortening. The results show that the speed necessary to achieve maximum work is about five times greater at higher temperatures compared to lower temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
