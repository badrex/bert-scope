The author discusses the semiannual inequality in the earth's magnetic elements and the influence of the sun's position in the ecliptic. The study finds that the horizontal force is slightly higher during summer months, but the effect of the sun's position is not clearly manifested in the dip. The author hopes that further observations will provide more insight into the sun's influence on terrestrial magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
