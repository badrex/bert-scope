They explain these phenomena using theoretical principles and demonstrate their conclusions through artificial experiments. The author explores the effects of varying densities in fluids and the atmosphere, showing how these variations can cause light rays to converge or diverge, resulting in multiple images of the same object.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
