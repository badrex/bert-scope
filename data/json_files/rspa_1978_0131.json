The authors derive a set of covariant equations that describe the propagation of gravitational waves and find that they satisfy eight transversality conditions. The study reveals that pure gravitational waves in these models are governed by a scalar wave equation, and the waves propagate solely with the speed of light in a specific model with the equation of state.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
