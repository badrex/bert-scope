They observe the process of ingestion, digestion, and ejection, and describe the role of cilia in guiding and breaking down food particles. The study provides insights into the digestive cycle and the internal mechanisms of protozoa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology"}
