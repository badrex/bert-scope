The observations reveal new insights into the westward-travelling surge, a key feature of substorm expansion. The study also highlights the importance of combining ground-based measurements with satellite data to gain a comprehensive understanding of the complex coupling processes in the magnetosphere and ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Physics"}
