The study focuses on the relation between the force and translation vectors, as well as the stress, strain, and rotation concentrations on the ellipsoidal surface. The analysis is extended to an incompressible matrix, which is analogous to an incompressible viscous fluid, and considers the translation of the ellipsoid under steady force.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
