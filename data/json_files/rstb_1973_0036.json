Chinese Spring)", "semantic_tags": ["Plant Development", "Cytogenetics", "Wheat Breeding", "Meiosis", "Reproductive Biology"], "tldr": "This study investigates the cell development in the anther, ovule, and young seed of wheat (Triticum aestivum L. var. Chinese Spring). The research focuses on the timing and rate of cell division, the duration of developmental stages, and the interrelation of events occurring in different organs within the wheat floret. The findings provide a comprehensive understanding of reproductive cell behavior in a higher plant species and pave the way for comparative studies using various mutant or chromosomally different genotypes of Chinese Spring.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
