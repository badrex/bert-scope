The increased body mass associated with reproduction negatively affects flight performance, making it more difficult for the birds to escape predators. This reduced ability to escape predators is an important and previously overlooked cost of reproduction in birds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
