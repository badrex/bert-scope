They demonstrate how this generalization can be used to extend the theory of summable functions and improve methods for integrating Fourier series. This work has implications for understanding the properties of various functions and their applications in mathematical analysis and functional analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Functional Analysis"}
