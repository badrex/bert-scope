They found that vibrations were larger in a vacuum and that the enlargement of vibrations was proportional to the quantity of air left in the receiver. The author also observed that adding weight to the pendulum clock increased the vibrations but caused the clock to lose time. Additionally, the author studied the effects of heat and cold on iron rods and concluded that these factors could affect the accuracy of pendulum clocks. The author leaves it to others to consider whether the Earth's figure or these environmental factors are more responsible for the phenomenon of pendulum clocks going slower near the equator.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
