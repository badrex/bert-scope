Vaso-dentine is characterized by a network of large canals containing capillaries, while osteo-dentine is formed by ossification and has a different canal system. The author proposes a new classification system for these types of dentine based on their development and structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
