The researchers found that lateral line fibres terminate in a dorsomedial region of the medulla, while cutaneous sensory fibres project caudally to the cervical spinal cord. The findings provide insights into the central processing of lateral line information and the interactions between acoustico-lateralis and somatosensory inputs.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroanatomy"}
