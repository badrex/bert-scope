They consider the deformation and displacement of material beneath a moving slider and analyze the scratch hardness process based on the effective resolved shear stress. The model predicts the nature of anisotropy in scratch hardness, which is consistent with the results for cubic crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
