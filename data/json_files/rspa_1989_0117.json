Using phase-Doppler anemometry, the researchers measured the velocity and flux distributions in the jet as a function of particle volume fraction and size. The results provide insight into particle mixing and help facilitate the understanding of particle dispersion in turbulent flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
