They analyzed various types of rocks and minerals, including sedimentary, igneous, and meteorites, using a method that measures the emanation produced by radium. The results showed that rocks with a high silica content are generally richer in radium than basic rocks. The study provides valuable insights into the distribution of radium and its potential connection to the Earth's internal heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
