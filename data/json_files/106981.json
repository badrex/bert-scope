The phenomenon allowed him to see landmarks like Dengeness and Dover cliffs with great clarity. This optical illusion was caused by the unique atmospheric conditions and was not witnessed by any of the locals or visitors present at the annual Rock-fair.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
