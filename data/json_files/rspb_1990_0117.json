They find that stromal swelling is biphasic and can be interpreted as an elementary cusp catastrophe. A thermodynamic potential governs corneal stromal swelling, with transitions following a \"saturation convention.\" The study provides new insights into the dynamics and mechanism of corneal swelling."}
