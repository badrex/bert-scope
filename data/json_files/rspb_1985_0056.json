The Malthusian parameter describes the intrinsic rate of increase of the population, while entropy measures the population's variability and stability. These two parameters act as complementary fitness indices to understand evolutionary change at different levels of selection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
