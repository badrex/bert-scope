They found that these plants have a unique genetic property where type characters are excluded from the germ-lineage. The authors also discovered that the proportion of non-pointed and pointed plants in the offspring depends on the position of the seeds on the parent plant.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
