They discovered that the coagulation of pus and the extrication of carbonic acid gas play a significant role in this process. The carbonic acid gas forms tubular canals that are filled with red blood, connecting the coagulated pus to the general circulation. This research provides insight into the science of surgery and wound healing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Wound Healing"}
