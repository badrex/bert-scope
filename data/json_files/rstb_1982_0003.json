The cells had resting potentials of -50 mV or more. During spontaneous or stimulus-evoked'swimming' episodes, the cells were tonically excited, fired one spike per cycle, and were hyperpolarized by chloride-dependent inhibitory postsynaptic potentials. These results provide evidence for the relation of tonic excitation to rhythmic locomotory pattern generation and indirect evidence for reciprocal inhibitory coupling between antagonistic motor systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
