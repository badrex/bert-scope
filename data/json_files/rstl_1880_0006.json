The author discusses the implementation of a clock-movement for the six-foot reflector's motion and the development of a new equatorial mounting for the three-foot reflector, which aimed to provide greater steadiness and ease of motion. These improvements allowed for more efficient and accurate astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telescope Design"}
