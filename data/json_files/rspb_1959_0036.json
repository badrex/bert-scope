The phosphatase activity declines rapidly during the logarithmic phase of growth and is affected by factors such as amino acid additions, molecular oxygen, and medium composition. The research suggests that phosphatase activity is highest in young cells and may be related to the presence of diffusible amino-acid intermediates in the medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
