They tested different liquids, such as aniline and oleum oil, to find the most suitable one for their experiments. The results showed that the heat evolved by the calorimeter was mainly used in the evaporation of water, and the author discussed the importance of accurate temperature measurements and the determination of the calorimeter's capacity for heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
