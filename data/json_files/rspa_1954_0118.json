The authors found that the protection provided by an oxide film depends on the geometrical arrangement of the sliding surfaces. They also discovered that the breakdown load, above which friction and surface damage increase, depends on the method of forming the surface oxide film. The presence of a lubricant can either enhance or inhibit the protective action of the oxide film, and the work-hardened layer on an abraded metal can also contribute to reducing surface damage and friction during sliding.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
