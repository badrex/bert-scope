E. Parry during their Arctic expedition in 1824-1825. They recorded the changes in the position of the horizontal needle, the dip of the magnetic needle, and the influence of the sun, moon, and aurora borealis on the magnetic oscillations. The authors also discussed the intensity of the earth's magnetic force and the effects of iron plates' rotation on compass deviation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Magnetism"}
