They use this method to study the changes in energy and charge distribution when a perturbation is applied to the core potential. The results can be used to investigate factors influencing the physical and chemical properties of complex molecules, particularly in aromatic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
