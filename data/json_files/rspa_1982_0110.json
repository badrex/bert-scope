They analyzed the combustion products and discovered that hydroxyl radicals play a significant role in the process. The addition of hydrogen bromide caused the complete conversion of hydroperoxides into decanones, even at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
