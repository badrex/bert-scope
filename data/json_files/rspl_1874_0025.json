The study shows that the hexagonal prism shape is the most efficient form due to the law of least action, and the cup-shaped cross joints are a result of the cooling process. The author also discusses the effects of heterogeneity in the basalt mass and various cooling conditions on the formation of these structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
