It demonstrates that mutational order can be more important than random genetic drift in certain circumstances, such as large populations or strong selection. The study also highlights the role of epistasis in intensifying the effects of mutational order and genetic drift on divergence between populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
