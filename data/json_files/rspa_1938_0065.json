The research shows that the fracture stage of steel represents the incidence of a certain condition of severe internal stress in the previously fragmented material. The experiments reveal that under safe stress ranges, no change in the structure is detected, while under unsafe ranges, heavy lattice distortion in the crystallites is observed. This work provides insights into the deformation and fracture of steel and contributes to the understanding of the material's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fatigue and Fracture of Materials"}
