They found that the crystal structure and spin Hamiltonian parameters for Dy in LaND are different from those in DyND and ErND. The results provide insights into the magnetic properties of lanthanide nicotinate dihydrates and the interactions between Dysprosium ions in the crystal lattice.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
