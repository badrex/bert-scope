They found that seeds exposed to temperatures between -183\u00b0C to -192\u00b0C for over 100 hours showed no difference in germination power compared to control seeds. This suggests that the protoplasm of resting seeds can enter a state of complete inertness, capable of supporting significant temperature drops without affecting their ability to germinate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
