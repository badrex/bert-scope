They found that the reaction velocities were independent of halogen concentration and represented the rates of ionization of the ketonic substances in the presence of basic catalysts. The results showed that certain anion bases had a significant catalytic effect on the bromination of certain ketones.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry", "sub_discipline": "Reaction Kinetics and Catalysts"}
