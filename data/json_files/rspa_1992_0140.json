The Melnikov method is used to calculate the exact distance between stable and unstable manifolds, and an exact expression is given for the critical amplitude for heteroclinic bifurcations. The article also provides details of the manifolds and their extensions into the opposite half-plane.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
