They find that acids, halogen compounds, and some other substances can inhibit the enzyme's activity, while sodium acetate and potassium sulfate can accelerate the reaction. This study helps to understand the role of enzymes in chemical reactions and their sensitivity to different substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Enzymes and Metabolism"}
