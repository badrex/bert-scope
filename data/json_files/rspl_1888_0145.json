They found that Europeans have a higher amount of cartilage compared to bone in the lumbar region, which helps reduce shocks transmitted through the column in an upright position. This research provides insights into the evolution of the human spine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
