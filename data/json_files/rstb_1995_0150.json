Their findings support the contention that New World vultures are not birds of prey but are more closely related to storks. The study also reveals that Old World vultures are polyphyletic, with the Aegypius-Gyps clad having evolved convergently to the more ancient Gypaetus and Neophron vultures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
