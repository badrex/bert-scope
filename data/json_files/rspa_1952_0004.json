They show that the approximation is valid for calculating resonance energies but may not be accurate for studying excited states. The authors also discuss the role of in-plane electrons in the molecule and their impact on the Hamiltonian and wave function.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
