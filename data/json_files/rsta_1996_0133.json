The authors analyze systems with elastically mediated interactions and their impact on kinetics and textures during phase transitions. They explore the formation of tweed textures, which are common in materials like oxygen-ordered layered cuprates, and the effects of sudden heating and inhomogeneities on ferroelastic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
