It demonstrates that cadmium, a known calcium channel blocker, also blocks the low-affinity TTX-binding Na channel at concentrations below 1mm. This finding suggests a possible structural difference between various types of Na channels and provides insight into the molecular basis of the low sensitivity of cardiac Na channels to TTX. The study also helps clarify the effects of cadmium, a cardiotoxic environmental pollutant, on the conduction system of the heart.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
