The surveys used specialized equipment, including echo sounders and pendulum apparatus, to gather valuable data on the Earth's gravitational field and the complex underwater landscape. These surveys provided important insights into the geophysics of the ocean floor and contributed to the understanding of the Earth's structure and dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
