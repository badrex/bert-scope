Researchers used site-directed mutagenesis to create variants of the human serine protease inhibitor c1-antitrypsin. They addressed three questions: alleviating the susceptibility of c1-antitrypsin to oxidative inactivation, altering the specificity of inhibition by modifying the active-centre sequence, and identifying essential residues at or near the active centre for the molecule's function. The study resulted in the production of several c1-antitrypsin variants of potential therapeutic value, particularly for pulmonary emphysema caused by hereditary or acquired c1-antitrypsin deficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
