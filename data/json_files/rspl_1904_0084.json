They found that the flame spectra contained more lines than the arc and spark spectra, and that the flame and oscillatory spark spectra were very similar in the visible region. The similarity was attributed to the temperature effects on the spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
