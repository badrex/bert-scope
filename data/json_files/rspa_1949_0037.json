They prepare and calibrate three sources, finding that the neutron yield is proportional to the radium content within 1%. The authors discuss the techniques used in the preparation and standardization of these sources and the possible errors in calibration. This new standard simplifies nuclear physical experiments by providing a more reliable and reproducible neutron source.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
