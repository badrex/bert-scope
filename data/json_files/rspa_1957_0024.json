They discovered three types of ice structures depending on the temperature: cubic, hexagonal, and vitreous ice. The researchers used X-ray diffraction to analyze the ice structures and found that the cubic form has unique properties, such as a different ratio of tetrahedral bonds compared to hexagonal ice. The study provides insights into the behavior of ice under various conditions and contributes to our understanding of its crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
