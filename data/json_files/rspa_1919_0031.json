This method is rapid, convenient, simple, and inexpensive, making it suitable for use with various time standards. The technique involves maintaining oscillations with a frequency that is an exact sub-multiple of the fork-interrupter's frequency, allowing for precise frequency determination.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
