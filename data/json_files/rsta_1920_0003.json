They used various methods, such as resistance heating, rapid compression of flame, and high-velocity bullets, to attempt to melt carbon and create diamond-like structures. The experiments provided valuable insights into the conditions required for diamond synthesis and the behavior of carbon under extreme conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
