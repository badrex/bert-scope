They found that the mean frequency of discharge of cortical neurons is affected similarly by changes in arousal levels, such as the transition from waking to slow-wave sleep. A simple neural model is proposed to explain these changes, suggesting that a subcortical system's output increases as arousal levels fall, providing both excitation and inhibition in fixed proportions.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Arousal and Neural Activity"}
