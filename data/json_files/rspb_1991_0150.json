The author found that these characteristics are positively related and have evolved in the same direction, suggesting that improvements in one trait are generally associated with improvements in other ejaculate traits. This indicates that there is a common selective force driving the evolution of these characteristics to increase the probability of fertilization and male reproductive success.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
