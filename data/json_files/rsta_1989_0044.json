It explores the structural instabilities and deformations in perovskite structures, which can lead to phase transitions and affect physical properties such as density, conductivity, and ionic transport. The article highlights the potential applications of this research in understanding the Earth's mantle and its circulation patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
