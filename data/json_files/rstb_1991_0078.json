It explores the different mechanisms of cellulose digestion in insects, such as the exploitation of protozoan and bacterial symbionts in the gut. The article also highlights the importance of studying insect cellulases to better understand the evolution of cellulose digestion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Evolutionary Biology"}
