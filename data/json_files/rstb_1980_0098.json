It also explores the chemiosmotic hypothesis, which explains how electron transport-dependent reactions drive ATP synthesis. The article highlights the importance of understanding microbial energetics for predicting growth yields and manipulating energy conversion efficiency in bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
