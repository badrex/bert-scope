By measuring the specific gravity of various mixtures of water and alcohol, Blagden aimed to establish a fair and accurate tax system. The study found that the specific gravity of these mixtures is influenced by factors such as the mutual penetration of water and alcohol and their expansion rates with heat. This research provided a scientific basis for determining the appropriate excise tax on different types of alcoholic beverages.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mixtures and Solutions"}
