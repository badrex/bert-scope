They derive an integral equation using Huygens's principle and the Laplace transformation, and provide a solution for the two-dimensional diffraction problem. The study focuses on the pressure distribution in front of and behind the strip, with implications for understanding sound wave behavior in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
