The researchers use X-ray crystallography to analyze the structure and find that the alpha-helix has a right-handed screw sense. They also discover that the stability of the alpha-helix is influenced by the arrangement of the side chains in the polypeptide chain.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
