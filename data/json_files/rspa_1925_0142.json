They found that the reaction proceeded uniformly according to the unimolecular theory even in the presence of surfaces or other gases. The results showed a disturbance in the reaction rate when the total pressure in the system fell below 0.1 mm of mercury. The authors proposed a reaction mechanism where a definite fraction of activated molecules always undergo decomposition, while a larger fraction does so only if they do not collide with other molecules for a period of about a second.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
