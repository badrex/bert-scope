They found that osmotic permeability in the lower Malpighian tubule decreases, preventing water movements accompanying 5-HT-stimulated potassium chloride resorption. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of fluid secretion by transporting epithelia in insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
