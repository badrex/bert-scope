They created thin metal films on cellulose acetate or rock salt bases and observed the diffraction patterns formed by the interaction of the cathode rays with the crystals. This technique provided valuable information about the crystal structures of metals like gold, silver, lead, and iron, and helped to improve the understanding of their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
