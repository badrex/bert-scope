These theories share properties with Einstein's general theory of relativity, such as predicting the same motions of mass particles and light rays in the gravitational field of a single heavy particle at rest. The author demonstrates that these new theories agree with all known observational facts, including the advance of perihelion and light deflection, while also being Lorentz invariant.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Waves"}
