Hougb made significant contributions to the field of astronomy, particularly in the study of tides and ocean currents. His work involved revising Laplace's theory, determining the nature and periods of ocean oscillations, and developing methods for calculating the rigidity of the Earth. Hougb also worked on the determination of accurate positions of stars and contributed to the improvement of transit circles for astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
