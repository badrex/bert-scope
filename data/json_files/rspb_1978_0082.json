The research shows a considerable increase in axon diameter and glial wrapping after the final moult, and a sharp decrease in the number of axons from the wing in the young adult. This information helps to understand the dynamic control of wing movements and the establishment of synaptic connections between identified neurons in the insect's sensory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neurophysiology"}
