They discovered that induced contractions are exclusive to the muscle in the state of contraction and that the phenomenon is not explained by an electric discharge similar to a jar discharge. The author also found that a coating of turpentine does not affect the electric discharge through a muscle, but prevents induced contractions. Further research is needed to understand the origin of these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
