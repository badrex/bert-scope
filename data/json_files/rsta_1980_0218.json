The authors find that these rocks have distinct chemical compositions, particularly in their orthopyroxenes, which can be linked to different degrees of partial melting and recrystallization. This evidence challenges the assumption that garnet herzolite is a homogeneous rock and suggests that the upper mantle is more chemically diverse than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Mantle Petrology"}
