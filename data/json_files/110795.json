Carpenter, examines the minute structure of invertebrate skeletons through microscopic analysis. He discusses various types of structures, such as prismatic cellular and tubular structures, and compares them to human dental structures like enamel and dentine. The paper also touches upon the epidermis and coloration of shells, with references to accompanying illustrations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
