The research uses a horizontal plate floating in oil and under torsional control to observe the deflection caused by the wind. Simultaneous measurements of the velocity profile above the surface help deduce von Karman's constant, which is found to vary with atmospheric stability. The observations also provide insight into the variation of mixing length with height.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
