They used the Marchi method to trace the degeneration of nerve fibers and found significant differences in the results compared to previous studies. The author observed extensive degeneration in the peduncles of the cerebellum and discussed the implications of these findings on the connections and functions of the cerebellum.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain Anatomy"}
