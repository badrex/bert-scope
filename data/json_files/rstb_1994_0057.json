The author argues that total energy consumption can serve as an indicator of global extinction rates, as it is correlated with the scale of human enterprise and its environmental impact. The author suggests that by analyzing historical data on energy use and extinction rates, current rates can be estimated, providing a valuable tool for understanding and addressing the ongoing loss of global biodiversity.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
