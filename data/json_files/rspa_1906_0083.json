They discovered that radium, barium, strontium, and lead salts cause a growth in gelatin, which is due to the formation of precipitates. The growth appears to have a cellular structure, but it is not a living organism. The experiments show that there is no connection between radioactivity and the formation of the growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemistry of gelatin"}
