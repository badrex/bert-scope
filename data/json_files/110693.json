Col. Sykes present meteorological observations made by Mr. S. H. Thomas in Alten, Finmarken, from 1837 to 1839. They discuss the barometer readings, temperature, and the Aurora Borealis phenomenon. The observations support Professor Forbes's theory, and the authors find a curious coincidence between the observations at Calcutta and Alten. The study also provides evidence of two centers of the Aurora Borealis phenomenon, which may be related to the magnetic foci of the northern hemisphere."}
