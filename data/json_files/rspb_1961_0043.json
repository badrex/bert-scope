The authors found that resistance to streptomycin results from a combination of first-stage mutation and physiological adaptation of the bacteria. They also discovered that exposing the bacteria to ultra-violet light can induce resistance in a culture of streptomycin-sensitive bacteria. This research sheds light on the mechanisms behind bacterial resistance to antibiotics and the potential for developing new strategies to combat it.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
