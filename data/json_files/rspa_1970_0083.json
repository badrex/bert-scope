They show that the generalized one-dimensional dispersion model describes the average concentration distribution exactly for all values of the independent variables if the dispersion coefficients are defined properly as functions of time. This analysis reveals the precise structure of the dispersion coefficients necessary for the dispersion model to be exact and can be used to study various unsteady state heat and mass transfer problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
