They use a formalism that simplifies the calculation of the transition probability and provides a simple proof of the Debye-Waller factor. The study derives general expressions for both incoherent and coherent cross-sections and examines the coherent cross-section in detail. Numerical results for various materials are discussed and compared with experimental data, showing satisfactory agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
