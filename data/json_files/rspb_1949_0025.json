They found that these worms synthesize or modify haemoglobin differently from their host species. The haemoglobin in Nippostrongylus muris and Strongylus spp. has a lower oxygen affinity compared to the host's haemoglobin, allowing them to adapt to their parasitic lifestyle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
