They found that argon, similar to helium, can modify and enhance certain spectral lines. The study also revealed that argon can cause an intensity shift in the spectra towards the red and can isolate the triplet system, which is a property common to both helium and argon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
