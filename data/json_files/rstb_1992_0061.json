The model predicts the shape of muscle fibers and tendinous sheets, as well as the internal pressure distribution in the central longitudinal plane of uni- and bipennate muscle bellies. Mechanically stable solutions for muscle architectures were calculated by equating the pressure developed by curved muscle fibers with the pressure under a curved tendinous sheet. The model's predictions are compared with architectural features of some leg muscles of humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
