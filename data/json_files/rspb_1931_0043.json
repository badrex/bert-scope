The experiments show that sweat excretion decreases with prolonged rest, but remains relatively constant during physical work. The results also indicate that sweat glands can become fatigued, leading to a decrease in sweat excretion over time. The study highlights the importance of acclimatization and individual differences in sweat composition and rate of sweating.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
