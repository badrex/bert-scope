This discovery is significant in understanding the influence of hybridization-type on the effective covalent radius of the carbon atom. The crystal structure of quaterrylene is determined by two-dimensional methods, and the authors discuss the possible reasons for the difference in bond lengths compared to current theory predictions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
