It explains that wood's high work of fracture is due to the arrangement of cellulose microfibrils in the secondary cell wall, which induces a unique form of buckling failure in tension. This behavior is similar to the yield point of ductile metals. The study also explores the use of glass-fiber composites with a similar morphology, which showed a significant increase in work of fracture.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Materials Science"}
