They identify issues with the method, such as discontinuity in the gradient of the split function and lack of orthogonality between the split-function and orbitals for other electrons. The authors also discuss alternative methods for calculating non-diagonal matrix elements and emphasize the importance of using an extended operator to ensure self-adjointness in quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
