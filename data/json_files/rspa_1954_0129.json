The theory is expanded to include several interpenetrating electric streams and is put into Hamiltonian form to potentially aid in the development of a new quantum theory of electrons. The main focus is on finding the equations that describe continuous electric streams, which may provide a more reliable foundation for electrodynamic theory and help solve problems in atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrodynamics"}
