They develop a theoretical formulation based on dispersion formulas and discuss its implications for understanding the behavior of dissolved substances in different solvents. The study highlights the importance of molecular interactions and physical or chemical changes in the absorption spectra of solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
