He discovered new substances that constitute the bases of these alkalies and found that they are conductive and can fuse when exposed to electrical powers. These substances have unique properties, such as being attracted by negatively electrified surfaces and repelled by positively electrified surfaces. This research expanded the understanding of electrochemistry and the nature of alkaline bodies."}
