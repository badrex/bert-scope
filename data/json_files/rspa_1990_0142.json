They discuss methods with second, fourth, sixth, and eighth-order convergence and transform the sixth-order differential equation into a system of three second-order differential equations. The methods are applied to the sixth-order eigenvalue problems associated with the onset of instability in a B\u00e9nard layer, and numerical results are compared with asymptotic estimates from the literature.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
