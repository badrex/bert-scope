The research reveals the detailed crystal structure of the orientationally-ordered low-temperature phase and evaluates the departure from isotropic scattering of the molecule in the disordered high-temperature phase. The study also discovers an orientational glass transition at around 86 K and provides insights into the molecular reorientation and structural phase transition of C60.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
