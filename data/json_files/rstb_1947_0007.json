They describe the barnacle's body shape, arrangement of plates, and the process of opening the mantle cavity for feeding and respiration. The study provides insights into the barnacle's unique opening mechanism, which involves hydrostatic pressure and a specialized muscle system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
