They found that the anisotropy in hardness can be used to determine the operative slip systems, identifying three different temperature regimes for the anisotropy. The results help explain the change in slip systems based on temperature-dependent changes in bonding in the carbides.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanics of Materials"}
