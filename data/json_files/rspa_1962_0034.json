They evaluated the potential energy of interaction between adsorbent and adsorbate and changes in translational, rotational, and vibrational kinetic energies of the adsorbate molecules. The results provide a description of the experimental adsorption isotherms and their variation with temperature. The total adsorptive interaction for the systems considered is due to London-type dispersion forces and the interaction due to the polarization of the adsorbate by the surface electric field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
