The author aimed to determine the relative magnetic forces acting on both dipping and horizontal needles at various locations. The results were used to calculate horizontal forces at each place compared to Plymouth, and then converted to whole forces in the direction of the dipping needle. The study provides valuable data for understanding geomagnetism and its applications in navigation and marine science.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
