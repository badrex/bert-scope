They observed chlorine isotopic splitting in the stretching modes of the linear units in the chains and developed a simple vibrational model that reproduces the observed splitting patterns. The study provides insights into the relationship between the stretching force constants and the electronic properties of these complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
