Crookes", "semantic_tags": ["Photometry", "Polarized Light", "Optics", "Instrumentation", "Jamin's Photometer"], "tldr": "In this article, W. Crookes compares his photometer design with M. Jamin's photometer, highlighting the differences in their construction and functionality. Crookes' photometer provides better sensitivity and accuracy in measuring light intensity, especially in low light conditions. He also explains the advantages of his design over Jamin's, such as the use of two luminous disks and a telescopic arrangement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
