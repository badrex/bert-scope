The study focuses on the Malacostraca and Branchiopoda, discovering that cephalic carapace folds are not present in these groups. Instead, the formation of cephalothoracic shields in Malacostraca is due to the fusion of the first thoracic segment to the cephalon and the obliteration of external segment borders. This revision of the carapace hypothesis allows for a new approach to eumalacostracan phylogeny and higher systematics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
