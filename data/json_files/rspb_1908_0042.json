They found that injecting the extract did not accelerate the appearance of male plumage in birds and sometimes caused local tissue necrosis. This suggests that the adrenal cortex may not contain a substance that stimulates the development of secondary sexual characters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
