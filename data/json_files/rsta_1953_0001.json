They also provide a lower bound for the distance of logarithms from variable algebraic numbers and prove that the fractional part of a number is greater than a certain value for every sufficiently large positive integer. This work improves upon earlier results and provides a more accurate measure of transcendency for logarithms of algebraic numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
