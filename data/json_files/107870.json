The instrument consists of two cylindrical chambers connected by a thermometer tube. The exterior surfaces of the chambers are coated with lamp black to absorb radiant heat, which causes an expansion of the enclosed air. This new thermometer allows for more precise measurements of radiant heat and its properties, such as the relative radiating powers of different surfaces and the law of diminishing radiant heat with distance from the radiating source.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Heat Transfer"}
