The model takes into account molecular diffusion, convection, facilitated diffusion, and non-equilibrium kinetics of CO with haemoglobin. The results show that the COHb levels computed from the model are in good agreement with experimental values, and the model provides a better approximation compared to other models.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
