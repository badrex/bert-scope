They establish the feasibility of the method using powdered solids and distilled water, then apply it to paraffin as fuel. The study covers dispersion, droplet charging, movement in fields, and combustion control, leading to the development of burners operated entirely by fields that draw in and accelerate air from the surroundings using corona discharges in multi-stage ion lamps.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics and Combustion Control"}
