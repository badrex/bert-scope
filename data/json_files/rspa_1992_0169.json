The analysis focuses on a stress rate potential equation and solves a family of rate boundary-value problems for concentrated incremental loads. Numerical examples reveal that the rate of axial diffusion is highly sensitive to the level of prestrain, with significant implications for the redistribution of stress rates and the behavior of the material near necking and the stress-free configuration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
