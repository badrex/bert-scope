They analyzed the inverse Reynolds equation and found that these conditions can be met in metal seals. Theoretical and experimental results are presented, showing the potential issues with working in this elastohydrodynamic regime.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
