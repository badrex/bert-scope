It also explores methods for finding the highest common internal divisor of two functions, multiplying linear factors, and expanding the binomial theorem. The author hopes that the proofs and applications in this paper will demonstrate the unique nature of symbolic algebra.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
