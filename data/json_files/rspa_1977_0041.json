The authors propose maximum likelihood estimation for parameterizing these distributions, which can be applied to various contexts, such as size distributions of diamonds or personal incomes. The study focuses on the mass-size distribution of wind-blown sand and its regularities, as discovered by R. A. Bagnold.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Soil Science"}
