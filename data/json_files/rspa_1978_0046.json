They avoid spurious long-range couplings and enforce Galilean invariance by including momentum translation factors. The results show excellent agreement with experimental data and previous calculations, demonstrating the adaptability of the adiabatic representation even at high energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
