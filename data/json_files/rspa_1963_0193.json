They identify two main effects in the transport of heat or momentum through gaseous mixtures: molecules of one species transporting heat or momentum for other species and the transfer of heat or momentum from one species to another. The study focuses on binary mixtures and extends the analysis to mixtures with any number of constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
