The author proposes that convection in the mantle can take place with plausible values of the dimensions of the hot column and the yield stress, coinciding with the stress drop estimated from the energy release in deep focus earthquakes. This convection can explain the oceanic ridges, the direction of intersecting Murray-Menard wrench faults, and the relative incompressibility of continents. The author also estimates the velocity of the westward drift of the Americas and the plasticization and fluxing of the crust, which may be the consequence of the precipitation of water from serpentine flowing continentward from the oceanic ridge.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Plate Tectonics"}
