They observed the phenomena through Kerr cells and image converters, and their results showed that the Rayleigh-Taylor type of instability is likely to be the dominant process. The authors also compared the observed growth rates with the predicted ones from theoretical studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
