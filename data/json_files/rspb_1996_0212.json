They found a negative correlation between DNA content and calyx diameter, suggesting that repetitive DNA may play a role in phenotypic variation and evolution. This discovery could help understand the genetic basis of flower size and its ecological significance in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
