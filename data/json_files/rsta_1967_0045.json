They found that the mean delay time was approximately 1 day, and the atmospheric response following a geomagnetic disturbance occurred at the same time for all longitudes in the equatorial region. This study provides insights into the heating mechanism during geomagnetic disturbances and the relationship between geomagnetic activity and atmospheric density variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
