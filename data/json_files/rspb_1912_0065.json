Gamgee had lower conductivity values due to impurities in his materials. The author's experiments showed that oxyhemoglobin solutions have a higher conductivity than previously thought, which is important for understanding the suitability of these solutions in blood analysis methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
