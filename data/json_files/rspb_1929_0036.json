They find that the critical temperature for muscle is around -1.5\u00b0C, below which the muscle loses its osmotic properties and irritability. The study also shows that the rate of thawing can affect the degree of damage caused by freezing.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
