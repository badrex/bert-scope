They found that the total nucleic acid content increased in degenerating nerves, while the DNA content remained relatively stable. After nerve stimulation, the total nucleic acid content remained unchanged, but the DNA content decreased significantly. These findings suggest that nucleic acid changes are associated with the activity of Schwann cells or changes in the axon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
