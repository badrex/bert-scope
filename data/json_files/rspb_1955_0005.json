It shows that invertebrates like Daphnia, Cladocera, Conchostraca, and insects like Chironomus and Anatopynia synthesize more haemoglobin in poorly aerated water, while others like annelid worms do not. The research also explores the haemoglobin content in tissue cells and cytochrome, revealing that these elements increase or decrease based on oxygen levels in the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Invertebrate Biology"}
