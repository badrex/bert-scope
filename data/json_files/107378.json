They found that chemical stimuli applied to the nervous system have a greater impact on the heart, while mechanical stimuli affect the muscles of voluntary motion. Both types of stimuli can excite the heart after they cease to affect the muscles of voluntary motion. The author also discovered that stimulating every part of the brain and spinal marrow equally affects the heart's action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
