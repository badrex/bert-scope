The radar system allowed them to detect and track insect density, height, and orientation during flight. This technique helped them understand how weather systems, like sea breezes, affect insect migration and distribution, which can aid in controlling pest populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology and Atmospheric Science"}
