The author proposes a recovery theory, suggesting that destroyed active centers can recover at a rate proportional to their concentration in the material. This theory helps explain the observed behavior of luminosity curves and provides a basis for predicting the ultimate behavior of compounds with varying compositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
