Hofmann, describes the synthesis and properties of ethylene-phenylamine, a new organic base, and its iodide compounds. Ethylene-phenylamine is formed by the reaction of bibromide of ethylene with aniline. The author also discusses the constitution and possible formulas for this new base and its compounds, as well as their reactions with iodide of methyl and ethyl.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
