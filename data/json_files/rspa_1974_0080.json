The authors found that ionization levels do not correspond to an equilibrium state, and they measured the rates of ion production and disappearance. They concluded that a third-order scheme is the most feasible ionization mechanism and that recombination occurs through a dissociative process. The findings provide insights into the behavior of alkaline earth species in flames and their potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Plasma chemistry"}
