They investigated the three-dimensional boundary layer when a Rankine-like vortex is bounded by a fixed plane boundary, such as a horizontal disc. The study found that the boundary layer was laminar at lower Reynolds numbers and transitioned to a turbulent state at higher numbers, with the radial pressure gradient having a stabilizing effect on the boundary layer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
