The authors develop a model to compare the performance of dichromatic and trichromatic vision in detecting fruit against a background of leaves. They find that trichromats have an advantage in detecting ripe fruit, while dichromats are almost as good at identifying fruit and leaves. The study suggests that trichromacy has evolved as a specialization for finding food in primates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
