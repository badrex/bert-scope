They found that the direction of electric osmose is generally the same as the direction of the electric current, and that the chemical composition of the electrolyte has a significant influence on the flow of liquids. The study also showed that rapid electric osmose is not limited to dilute solutions and that concentrated solutions can sometimes prevent the effect.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
