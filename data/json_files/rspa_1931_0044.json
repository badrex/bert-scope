They studied the spark spectrum of selenium, observing lines mainly with strong discharges through selenium vapor in vacuum tubes. The authors identified the spectra of Se IV and Se V and provided a term scheme for Se IV, contributing to the understanding of selenium's atomic structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
