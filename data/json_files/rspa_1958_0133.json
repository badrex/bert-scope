They use high-speed photography to study the behavior of shock waves and the conditions required for initiation. The results show that initiation occurs within the body of the explosive, and the detonation rate in the receptor is initially higher than in the donor. The authors also discuss the role of air gaps and solid barriers in the initiation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
