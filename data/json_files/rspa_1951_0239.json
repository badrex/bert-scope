They also demonstrate how the de Haas-van Alphen effect arises from the singularities of the partition function in Fermi-Dirac statistics. This theory confirms previous results and provides a solid foundation for understanding the behavior of electrons in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
