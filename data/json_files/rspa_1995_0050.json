They developed a theoretical model that explains the energy deposition process and the formation of carbon clusters through random'sticky' collisions. This model helps to understand the conditions required for fullerene formation and the phase transition from graphite to fullerene.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
