The internal reflector is a thick, chalky white layer that reflects about 70% of the visible light spectrum. The external reflector is a specular reflector that directs light outwards and upwards. These reflectors work together to enhance the fish's luminescence, which is used for communication and attracting prey.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
