The system allows for the direct entry of design information from the designer's layout into the computer, using a combination of equipment and a graphical coding system. This system simplifies the design process, improves efficiency, and enables the storage of detailed part descriptions on magnetic media for subsequent reproduction of detail drawings.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
