The experiments demonstrated that radiant heat can pass through transparent screens, and a liquid screen is more permeable to radiant heat than a solid one. This discovery challenges previous theories and provides new insights into the behavior of heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
