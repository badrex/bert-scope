They studied the changes that occur in egg white during the development process, discovering that the water content decreases while the protein content becomes more concentrated. The author also found evidence of enzymes and proteins in the egg white, suggesting that the embryo's nutrition is derived from the egg white rather than the uterine secretion through a process of direct digestive changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
