The experiments reveal that a transition from smooth sliding to irregular stick and slip motion occurs at a temperature specific to the lubricant. The results suggest that lubrication is affected by a unimolecular film adsorbed on each surface, and the properties of surface films on metals can be studied through frictional behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Tribology"}
