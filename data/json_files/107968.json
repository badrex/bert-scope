The study focuses on hedgehogs, dormice, and bats, observing their respiration rates, temperature changes, and ability to withstand the absence of air during different stages of sleep. The author also discusses the connection between the different levels of sleep and the animal's overall health and well-being.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
