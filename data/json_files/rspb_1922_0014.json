They found that the rate of cooling depends on wind velocity, air temperature, and humidity. They developed equations to calculate the cooling power of the kata-thermometer, taking into account different wind velocities and humidity levels. This work helps to better understand and measure ventilation in various environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
