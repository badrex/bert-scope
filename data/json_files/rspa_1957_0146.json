The results showed that the Nernst-Einstein equation does not accurately represent the equivalent conductance of molten salts, suggesting that there are two diffusion mechanisms at play. This study provides insights into the structure of molten salts and the relations between kinetic properties and the properties of constituent ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
