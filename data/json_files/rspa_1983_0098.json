The author provides analytical solutions and solutions derived by successive approximation for various cases. The paper also discusses the maximum stiffness design of flexural members with self-weight taken into account, formulating the variational problem and solving the necessary optimality conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
