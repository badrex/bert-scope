The author suggests that a modular approach can provide a better understanding of coral morphology, colony organization, and growth. By considering coral modules in terms of design and topology, the author aims to advance our knowledge of these organisms and contribute to the broader understanding of metamers, meristems, and modules in biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Coral Biology"}
