This method reduces friction, increases extrusion ratios, and improves product accuracy. The article discusses the history, mechanics, and applications of hydrostatic extrusion, as well as its effects on material properties and the potential for future advancements in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metalworking"}
