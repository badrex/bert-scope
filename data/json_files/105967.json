The animal has a variety of shapes and can change its form. It has a single opening that serves as its mouth and can extend to consume large sea creatures. The author also discusses the Hydra, a related animal, and compares the two. The Actinia Sociata reproduces by producing eggs and multiplying from its sides. This discovery is important for natural history as it helps clarify the nature of zoophytes and their growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
