They discovered that healthy leaves restore the air's original composition of 21% oxygen by absorbing carbon dioxide and releasing oxygen. This process occurs even at night, albeit more slowly, and is accelerated by light. The author also found that no carbon dioxide production occurs when the leaf is in good health.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
