They observe various effects, such as bleaching and darkening, in these haloes and discuss the possible explanations for these phenomena. The author believes that the reversal theory best explains the observations, suggesting that a similar effect may occur in very ancient haloes with strongly radioactive nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
