The results show that the heat capacity of these alkali halide crystals generally agrees with the predictions of harmonic lattice theory, except at the highest temperatures. This study provides a foundation for further analysis and interpretation of the thermal properties of these crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
