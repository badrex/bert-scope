They found that water obtained from melted sea water ice is free of salt and has a lower specific gravity than sea water. The author also discovered that the freezing point of sea water is approximately 28.5 degrees Fahrenheit. These findings have implications for understanding the behavior of water in cold environments and the potential for freshwater sources in polar regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
