The author presents postulates for the properties of neutrinos, such as zero rest-mass and the direction of motion being unchanged by radiative interactions. The central problem of the theory is to find a law of interaction between neutrinos and charged particles that reproduces the observed features of radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
