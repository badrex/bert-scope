The study examines the extent of the damage and the recovery process of the affected plants. The primary factors determining the area of fume-damaged vegetation were the nature and volume of toxic gases released by the volcano, the direction of the prevailing wind, and the sensitivity of the dominant plants to the fumes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
