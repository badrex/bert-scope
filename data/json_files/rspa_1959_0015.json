They find that no hyperbolic orbit can have perihelion inside a certain distance, and elliptic orbits cannot have perihelion inside either. Particles going inside these distances will be captured, while circular orbits are possible for any greater radius. The study also explores the travel of light rays and the effects of gravity on particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
