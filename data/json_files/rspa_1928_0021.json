The theory explains the deviations from the Lorentz formula and provides a quantitative explanation for the behavior of various liquids. The study also highlights the importance of considering the orientation of molecules in the fluid and the asymmetry of molecules in dense fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
