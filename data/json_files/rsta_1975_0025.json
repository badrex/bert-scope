They develop a cyclic process to refine Earth structure models and earthquake mechanisms using a global network of seismographs. The study presents two new Earth models and discusses the compressive changes in volume during earthquakes, suggesting the possibility of \"silent earthquakes.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
