The authors use scanning electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy to analyze the chemistry and physical structure of the materials, providing insight into the sensitization of roughly handled explosives and the early stages of ignition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
