It discusses the importance of squid in the diet of various seabird species, such as albatrosses, petrels, penguins, and auks. The study highlights the significance of squid in the diet of seabirds outside the breeding season and the potential impact of seabirds on squid populations. The article also emphasizes the need for further research on the dynamics of squid-seabird interactions and their implications for the management of commercial fisheries.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
