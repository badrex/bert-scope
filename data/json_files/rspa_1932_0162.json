They used a retarding potential method and an electrostatic field analysis to measure the energy distribution of positive ions. The results showed that ions with energies ranging from zero to the full energy corresponding to the potential across the discharge were present, with a maximum number of ions at low energies and a sharp decline at energies close to the cathode fall potential.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
