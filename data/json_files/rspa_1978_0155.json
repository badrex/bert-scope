The authors discuss the effects on groundwater levels, storage, and the potential long-term consequences on British aquifers. They also highlight the importance of groundwater in England and Wales' water supply and the role of climate in influencing groundwater levels and recharge.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrogeology"}
