The authors find that the axisymmetric boundary layer develops a complex multilayer structure dependent on the trailing-tip shape. The study provides numerical and analytical results for the flow properties, focusing on the boundary layer development from the front stagnation point to the onset of the trailing tip.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
