He concludes that the buffy coat is mainly due to the increased tenuity of the blood, or the reduced thickness of the coagulable lymph, caused by the inflammation. This finding challenges the common belief that the buffy coat is a result of slow blood coagulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
