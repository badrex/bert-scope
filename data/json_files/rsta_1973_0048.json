These accelerometers are small, sensitive, and have strict control of internal temperature and pressure. They can detect teleseismic signals with a surface wave magnitude of 2.5 at a distance of 190 km and provide valuable data for studying earthquakes, tides, and other Earth movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
