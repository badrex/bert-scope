The method involves diluting the air with fresh air to maintain a low level of organic matter and using the sense of smell to determine the condition of the air. The author provides data from experiments conducted in barracks and hospitals to support the method.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Air Quality and Ventilation"}
