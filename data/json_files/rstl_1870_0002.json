They found that the refraction-equivalent of a mixture or a chemical compound is the sum of the refraction-equivalents of its constituents. This discovery helps in calculating the effect of transparent bodies of known composition on the rays of light transmitted by them. The author also examined a large number of aqueous solutions of salts and found that the refraction-equivalent of a salt in solution depends on the difference between it and the refraction-equivalent of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
