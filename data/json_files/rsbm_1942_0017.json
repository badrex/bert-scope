He discovered the Smith-Forsyth product theorem, which connected the double theta-functions with integrals of the square roots of quintic and sextic polynomials. Forsyth's work helped to unify and organize the complex subject of double theta-functions, making it more accessible to mathematicians.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > History of Mathematics"}
