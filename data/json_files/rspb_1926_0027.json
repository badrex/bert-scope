They used the \"carbamate process\" to separate the hydrolysis products into different groups, including dicarboxylic amino-acids, barium carbamates, and free amino-acids. They discovered new amino-acids in the hydrolysis products of plant proteins, which were previously unknown. The authors also attempted to further fractionate these amino-acids using picrates, basic lead acetate, and zinc or cadmium salts, achieving varying degrees of success.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
