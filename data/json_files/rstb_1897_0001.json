They discovered that carbon dioxide reduces nerve excitability and causes a decline in the negative variation of nerve current. This research helped to understand the differences between nerve and muscle fatigue and the role of carbon dioxide in nerve function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nerve Physiology"}
