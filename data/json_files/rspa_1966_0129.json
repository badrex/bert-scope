The authors find that the effective dispersion coefficient depends on the fluid's properties and can be calculated using Aris's approach. The results show that the previous findings for Newtonian fluids and power-law fluids can be derived from this work, and Aris's modification can be applied to non-Newtonian fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
