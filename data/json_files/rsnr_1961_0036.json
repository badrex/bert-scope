Croone rejected the idea of animal spirits inflating muscles and instead proposed that muscles contract due to the tension in the nerves. He believed that muscles were made up of fibrous tissue and flesh, and that the nervous system was composed of distinct fine fibers. Croone's ideas contributed to the development of early modern physiology and the mechanical philosophy of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
