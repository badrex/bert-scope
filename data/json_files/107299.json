They discovered that the wombat has a double uterus and a different mechanism in its hind legs for burrowing. The reproductive system of the wombat is similar to that of the American opossum, and the author also found that the semen is carried directly into the uterus through the os tince, not through the lateral canals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
