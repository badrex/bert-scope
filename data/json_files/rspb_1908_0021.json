They found that cholesterol is a widely distributed substance in the animal and vegetable kingdoms and plays an essential role in cell metabolism. The authors also discovered that cholesterol is excreted in the bile and that its excretion is influenced by the diet. They discussed the different forms of cholesterol found in animal feces and the importance of further research on its metabolic roles and functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
