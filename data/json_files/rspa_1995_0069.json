This analysis corrected a significant issue in the literature, where the refractive index profile obtained for a particular fiber depended on the refractive index of the immersion liquid used to make the measurement. The results suggest that PET fibers spun under different conditions have different structural properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
