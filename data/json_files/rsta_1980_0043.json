These techniques improve the relative positioning accuracy of tracking stations by overcoming issues with satellite ephemeris and random jumps in satellite coordinates. The methods were tested using a 900 km precise terrestrial traverse in the United Kingdom, comparing the results with the traverse's geodetic coordinates of high accuracy. The findings show that these techniques can lead to substantial improvements in positioning accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
