The research focuses on understanding the uptake, distribution, and excretion of lead in the human body, which is essential for predicting the effects of lead exposure on blood lead levels. The findings can help in developing strategies to mitigate the impact of lead on human health.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Environmental Health"}
