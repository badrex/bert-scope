They extended their measurements to lower electron energies and larger scattering angles, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon. Their findings support the idea that the results for inelastic scattering are due to single scattering in the gas, with no significant contribution from multiple scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas physics"}
