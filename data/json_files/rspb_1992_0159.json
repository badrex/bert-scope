They found that the NR1-NR2A and NR1-NR2B combinations have similar conductances and sublevel transitions, resembling native NMDA receptors in hippocampal and cerebellar cells. The NR1-NR2C combination produces a channel with different conductances, closely resembling channels found in large cerebellar neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
