They demonstrate how the model can be transformed using dual and star-triangle transformations and show that it can be reduced to the six-vertex model. The authors also establish a connection between the Ashkin-Teller model and the Potts model, highlighting the critical points and their relation to the partition function.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
