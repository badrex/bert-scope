They discovered that the cellulose chains in the primary layer have a pseudo-transverse orientation, which is different from the secondary layer. This finding challenges previous theories about the relationship between the primary wall structure and tracheid length. The authors also examined the mechanisms of chain orientation in elongated cells and discussed the implications of their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
