They found that fumarate increases the respiration of muscle tissue, while malonate inhibits it. The addition of fumarate to the tissue acted as a catalyst, preserving the normal respiration of the tissue. The study also showed that tissue extract had a greater impact on respiration than fumarate alone, and that the extract's effect was not due to added substrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
