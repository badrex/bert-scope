They found that the synthesis of neutral fat occurs in the intestinal villi before the lymph reaches the mesenteric lacteals. The experiments also showed that pancreatic extracts have a marked ability to release fatty acids from soap, which may protect the body from the toxic effects of soaps in the circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Lipid Metabolism"}
