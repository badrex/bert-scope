They propose that the massif evolved as an oceanic volcanic pile and was uplifted during the Alpine orogeny. The high-density rocks causing the gravity anomaly are correlated with the ultrabasic rocks of the Troodos Plutonic Complex, suggesting that they represent upper mantle material.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Geophysics"}
