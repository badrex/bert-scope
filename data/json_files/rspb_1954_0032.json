They discovered three main pigments: magenta, brown, and blue, which form a striking pattern on the exumbrella. The pigments are intracellular and extracellular, and their distribution varies in different parts of the jellyfish. The magenta pigment appears to be a chromoprotein, while the brown pigment is both intracellular and extracellular. The blue pigment is exclusively intracellular and found in the gonadial endoderm, gastric filaments, and exumbrella.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
