They found that the choice of which enantiomer is of lower energy depends on the molecular conformation, particularly the type of furanose ring pucker. The study suggests that the weak interactions play a significant role in the selection of enantiomers in biomolecules, contributing to the homochirality observed in terrestrial biochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
