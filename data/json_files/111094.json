The author, Gideon Algernon Mantell, examines the structure and origin of these spines, which were initially thought to be a serrated crest along the back of the Hylaeosaurus. After 18 years, Mantell obtained a new specimen that confirmed his original interpretation of the spines' function. The article highlights the importance of further examination and understanding of dinosaur anatomy and paleontology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
