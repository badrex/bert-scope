They explore the role of thermosolutal convection, which arises from buoyancy forces caused by solute segregation in the partly solidified mushy region of a casting. The study covers a range of materials, including metallic, aqueous, and organic systems, and discusses the implications of their findings for understanding and improving casting processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Solidification and Casting"}
