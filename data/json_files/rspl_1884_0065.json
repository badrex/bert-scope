They demonstrate how these principles can be used to deduce new relationships between physical phenomena and simplify dynamical principles. The author also discusses the concept of treating all energy as kinetic, which can lead to a more simplified understanding of the principles of varying action and conservation of energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Classical Mechanics"}
