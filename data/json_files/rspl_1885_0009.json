The author explains the process of analyzing tides into different components and provides tables of data for various ports. The analysis helps determine the height of water due to specific tides at any given time, past or future, and is essential for understanding the complex nature of tidal patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
