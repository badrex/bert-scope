They analyze the energy levels and interactions of electrons with materials, concluding that both secondary electron emission and soft X-ray generation occur simultaneously and share similar mechanisms. The study provides insights into the underlying processes of electron and X-ray interactions with materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electron Physics"}
