Cresswell Baber, conducted further research on the minute structure of the thyroid gland, extending their observations to various vertebrate animals under the direction of Dr. Klein. They discovered differences in the thyroid gland structure among different animals, including the presence of lymphatics, blood vessels, and parenchymatous cells. The author also observed undeveloped portions of the gland and discussed the development of vesicles in the thyroid gland.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
