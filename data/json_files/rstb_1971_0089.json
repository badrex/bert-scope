It explains how potassium ions enter the tubule cells and are actively pumped into the lumen, creating a trans-wall potential that allows passive movement of anions from the haemolymph into the lumen. The article also describes the role of apical and basal membranes in coupling ion and water movements, and how this process leads to the secretion of an iso-osmotic fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular and Molecular Biology"}
