It explores the similarities and differences between metal clusters and alkenes, as well as the role of heteroatoms in stabilizing cluster bonding orbitals. The article also examines the photoelectron spectra of metal carbonyl compounds with metal-metal bonds, providing insights into the localization of bonding electrons and the effects of electrophilic attack.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
