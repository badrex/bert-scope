They found that the low-temperature species were di-a-adsorbed, and chemisorption occurred without isomerization about the C=C bond. The spectra and composition data for the but-2-enes were different from but-1-ene, showing that double-bond migration did not occur along the C4 chain and that the but-2-enes did not give the butylidyne structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
