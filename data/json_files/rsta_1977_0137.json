They explore the elliptic umbilic catastrophe, a type of degenerate critical point, and its impact on the extension of dissolved polymer molecules. The high extension of the polymer molecules is observed as intense localized flow birefringence, and the diminution in this intensity near degenerate critical points can be used to estimate macromolecular relaxation time.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
