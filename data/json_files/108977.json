They analyze the bones, dimensions, and proportions of the pectoral limbs and compare them to the spine. The study provides insights into the evolutionary relationships and classification of primates based on their skeletal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
