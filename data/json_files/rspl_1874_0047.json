The authors, J. Norman Lockyer and W. Chandler Roberts, use a modified oxyhydrogen blowpipe and a lime tube to study the spectra produced by different metals. They observe channelled-space absorption and continuous absorption in the blue, and discuss the effects of temperature and metal purity on the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
