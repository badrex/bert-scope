It examines the local Aboriginal words for various animals and compares them to the words recorded by Banks. The author concludes that the word 'kangaroo' likely refers to the Eastern wallaroo or Eastern grey kangaroo, and discusses the challenges in identifying the exact species due to the scarcity of these animals in the Endeavour River district.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
