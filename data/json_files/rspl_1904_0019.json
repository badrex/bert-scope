They discovered that the fungi's ability to infect a specific plant species is due to chemotaxis, where the fungi are attracted to specific substances in the plant's cell-sap. The authors also found that infection occurs more often during the night or in dull, damp weather due to increased turgidity and the presence of more chemotactic substances in the plant's cell-sap.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
