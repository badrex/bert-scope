The authors use a reaction mechanism established in previous research to analyze changes in photo-oxidation observed in intermittent light. They evaluate the velocity coefficients of rate propagation and termination reactions for various olefins and discuss the significance of the results in interpreting the oxidation mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
