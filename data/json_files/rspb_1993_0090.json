L. Gregory, explains that Mackay Rays' shimmer is caused by optical changes in the eye's accommodation rather than a central brain effect. The shimmer disappears when viewed through a pin-hole, which increases the depth of field and reduces the effect of fluctuations in accommodation. This suggests that the dynamic shimmer has an optical cause, due to changes in the size of the retinal image from the eye's rapid focusing adjustments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Visual Perception"}
