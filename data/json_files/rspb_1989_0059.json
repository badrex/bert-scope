They propose that accurate distance information can be estimated directly from vertical disparities without the need for extraretinal sources. This discovery could explain the relative crudeness of our conscious appreciation of egocentric distance and provide insight into the neural mechanisms responsible for distance estimates and depth constancy.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
