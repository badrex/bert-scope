The eruption formed a caldera, Oskjuvatn, and produced pyroclastic deposits. The study divides the deposit into several layers, representing different phases and styles of activity. The research focuses on layer thickness, grain size variations, ejecta density, and lithologies to understand the eruption and its products.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
