They modify the normal technique of \"liquidation\" and introduce upper and lower limits to the characteristic number to approach the exact solution. This method can be applied to various engineering problems involving vibration and structural dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
