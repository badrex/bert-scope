They observed the formation of negative and positive ion clouds and analyzed the effects of gap distance, voltage, and potential differences on the ion cloud behavior. Their findings provide insights into the behavior of spark discharges and the potential applications of cloud chambers in studying such phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
