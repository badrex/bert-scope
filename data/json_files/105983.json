He found that lime deepened the color produced by some astringents but did not improve color preservation. The author also discovered that a slight boiling was preferable for creating durable colors. Additionally, he found that adding pearl ashes to astringent mixtures produced deeper black colors.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Dyeing and Coloration"}
