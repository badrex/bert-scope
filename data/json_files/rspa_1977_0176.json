It explores the heat balance and reaction rates, and introduces the dimensionless parameters that help understand the critical behavior of thermal systems. The author also compares different approximations to the Arrhenius term and their effects on the analysis of thermal explosions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Kinetics"}
