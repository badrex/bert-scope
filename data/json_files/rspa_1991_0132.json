The authors develop a method to find series solutions for the amplitude evolution of disturbances and apply it to the Ginzburg-Landau equation, a model for instability growth in fluid-dynamical systems. They find criteria for the onset of global instability and discuss the implications of their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
