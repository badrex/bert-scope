The authors conclude that the extinction rates of UK invertebrates have likely matched or exceeded those of vertebrates and vascular plants. The main reasons for decline are analyzed, with a clear pattern found in terrestrial biotopes where most endangered species inhabit either early or late successional stages. The article highlights the importance of understanding the underlying mechanisms of decline to make accurate predictions of future extinctions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
