They use the Boltzmann equation and a variational method to derive expressions for electrical conductivity and thermo-electric power, valid over the whole temperature range and for different degrees of electron gas degeneracy. The theory is applicable to polar semi-conducting metal oxides and sulphides, and provides a foundation for understanding conduction phenomena in these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
