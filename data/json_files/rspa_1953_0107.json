They expressed the asymmetric field of two unequal attracting centers as the sum of two fields, one symmetrical and the other antisymmetrical. They used a perturbation method to calculate the effect of the antisymmetric field on the wave functions and energies of two electrons in the symmetrical part of the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Orbital Theory"}
