They used two experimental methods to measure the reaction rates at different concentrations and temperatures. The results showed that the reaction rate was significantly influenced by the solvent and temperature, providing insights into the reaction mechanism and the role of the solvent in the transformation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
