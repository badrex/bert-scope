The authors found that the Auger lines in the spectra of some elements, such as copper, show significant chemical shifts upon oxidation, while the photoelectron peaks lose intensity and shift by smaller amounts. This discovery allows for better analysis of surface compounds, particularly oxides, in fields like corrosion science and electronic engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
