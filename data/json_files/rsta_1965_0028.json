The authors analyze seismic data and the structure of oceanic crust, questioning the uniformity of crust formation and the validity of the mid-ocean ridge theory. They also address the challenges in understanding oceanic sedimentary volumes and heat flow patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
