The authors study the effects of charge pressed density and confinement on deflagration and detonation velocities. They observe that both explosives exhibit a maximum density conducive to DDT. The results contribute to understanding the mechanisms of DDT and can be used in theoretical modeling for safe storage and use of reactive materials and development of detonators based on secondary explosives."}
