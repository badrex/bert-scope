The authors estimate that shear stress in the upper portions of major active thrust faults is several tens to hundreds of MPa, contributing to the support of mountain ranges. The study also provides insights into the stress distribution associated with active and inactive thrust faults.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
