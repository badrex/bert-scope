The study compares the cytochemistry and ultrastructure of compatible and incompatible pollinations, providing insights into the complex processes that prevent self-fertilization in this species. The findings contribute to the understanding of plant reproduction and the development of strategies to improve crop yields.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
