However, upon further examination, he discovered that the magnetic power could be attributed to about 4-th part of iron alloyed with the titanium. This led him to suspect that titanium might be contaminated, and he concluded that it should not be classified as a magnetic metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
