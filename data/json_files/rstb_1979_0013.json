The research reveals strong seasonal variations in precipitation, with the highest amounts and frequency during the wet season from December to April. Diurnal patterns show a peak in rainfall between 10 am and 3 pm, with less rainfall during early morning and late evening hours. The study also examines the influence of the atoll on its own weather and the role of seasonal variations, prevailing winds, and atmospheric pressure waves on rainfall patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
