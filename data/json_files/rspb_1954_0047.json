Results show that thresholds of cutaneous and gustatory sensitivity, knee-jerk reflex, equilibratory movements, and reaction times to optic stimulation were altered at high altitudes. These changes demonstrate a stimulation of the sensory organs and reflex activity of various nervous functions up to 3500 m, followed by depression at higher altitudes. The observed stimulation is interpreted as an 'ergotropic' regulation of the autonomic nervous system, with increased sympathetic activity, which helps the human body adapt to oxygen lack.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
