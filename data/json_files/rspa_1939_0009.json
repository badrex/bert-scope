They found that the rotational levels of the low-frequency fundamental vibration are subject to perturbations from the inactive fundamental at 1536 cm due to the Coriolis term in the Hamiltonian. The theoretical envelope of the absorption band agrees well with the observations, and this effect may be expected in the spectra of all polyatomic molecules with a threefold or higher axis of symmetry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
