They discovered that stroking the iris or stopping blood flow in the eye can cause a rise in intra-ocular pressure. The authors also found that adrenaline and cocaine can affect these responses, suggesting that they may be related to nerve activity. These findings provide insight into the development of glaucoma and potential treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
