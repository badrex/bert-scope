The researchers found that fatty substances in cell interfaces can withstand varying H-ion concentrations without tearing the cell apart. They also discovered that living cells can buffer against changes in interfacial tension, which may play a role in muscle contraction and the response of certain cells in the central nervous system to pH changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
