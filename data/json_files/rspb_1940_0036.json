They found that ineffective nodules have smaller volumes of active bacterial tissue and shorter active durations, which result in less nitrogen fixation. The study provides insights into the factors that determine the effectiveness of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in legume plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
