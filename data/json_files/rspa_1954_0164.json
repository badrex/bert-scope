The calculated value is nearly constant and agrees well with experimental measurements, supporting the suggestion that previous measurements may have been affected by the presence of other gases. The study also provides a detailed analysis of various processes contributing to ionization.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ionization and Nuclear Physics"}
