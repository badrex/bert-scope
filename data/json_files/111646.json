They find that the differences in conductivity are due to the presence of impurities, rather than a change in the physical condition of the metal. The author also explores the effects of different metallic admixtures on the conductivity of copper and suggests that further research is needed to understand the influence of temperature on conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
