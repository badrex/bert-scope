They found that the diffusion coefficient was independent of the diffusant concentration and was affected by the morphology of the disordered interlamellar region. The results support the reptation model for polymeric diffusants in an entangled polymer melt, suggesting that snake-like motion persists down to a diffusant size of some backbone units.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
