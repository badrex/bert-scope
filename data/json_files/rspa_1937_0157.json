They found that the heat of sorption varies with the quantity adsorbed, and the surface structure of graphite has a strong dependence on temperature. The study also suggests that the adsorbing surfaces in carbons are mainly non-metallic. This research provides insights into the surface properties of graphite and its potential applications in various fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
