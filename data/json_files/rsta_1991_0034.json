The method involves transforming the electronic hamiltonian into a tridiagonal matrix and constructing a set of basis orbitals. This process provides a convergent expansion of the energy resolvent as a continued fraction, which can be used to calculate physical quantities and express them in terms of sums of mutually avoiding quantum mechanical paths.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
