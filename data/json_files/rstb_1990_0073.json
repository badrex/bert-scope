Four distinct pH periods were identified, with the most significant being the recent acidification phase that began around 1900 AD and reached a pH of 4.5 during the 1960s. This acidification is attributed to human activity, such as acid deposition and land use changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleolimnology"}
