The author derives an equation that governs the propagation of finite amplitude sound and applies it to obtain a relativistic version of Jeans' instability criterion. The study provides insights into the gravitational stability of a medium and has implications for understanding the growth of condensations in the universe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity"}
