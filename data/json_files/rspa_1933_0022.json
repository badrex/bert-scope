By using the action principle and considering the properties of a wave field, the author derives the classical law of motion for an electron in an electromagnetic field. This work contributes to the understanding of particle behavior and the development of a more satisfactory concept for describing small particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum mechanics"}
