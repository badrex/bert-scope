They analyzed the magnetic structure factors using a model for the magnetization density of multipoles and valence functions on the iron and ligand atoms. The results showed that the iron electronic configuration corresponds to the cubic configuration of the low-spin ion with all spin in the d orbitals. The spin delocalization onto nitrogen atoms reflects covalence, and the ligand populations deviate from cubic symmetry due to the influence of the crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
