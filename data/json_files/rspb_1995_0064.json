The results show that older males have a higher reproductive success through extra-pair paternity, resulting in an average reproductive output 36% higher than that of yearlings. This discovery challenges the idea that older males are chosen for their high quality, as they are cuckolded at the same rate as other males.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
