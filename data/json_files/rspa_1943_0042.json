The researchers found that proteins adsorb to charged oil/water interfaces under specific pH conditions, causing flocculation of oil droplets. The adsorption process is reversible, and structural changes in the protein molecule can occur after adsorption. This phenomenon has potential applications in understanding the behavior of proteins and their interactions with oil/water interfaces in biological systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
