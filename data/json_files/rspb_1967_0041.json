The reaction with iodine modifies the indole rings of tryptophan residues 108 and 62 to oxindole, which may affect the enzyme's activity. The inactive product obtained from the 1:1 iodination is similar to the one described by Hartdegen and Rupley, but the exact role of the modified residues in the enzyme's activity remains unclear.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure and Function"}
