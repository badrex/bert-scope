The authors estimate the height of the charged regions in the cloud and discuss the processes that trigger the discharge to ground. They also analyze the temperature levels at which electricity in thunderclouds is generated, providing insights into the unsolved problem of the generating process.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
