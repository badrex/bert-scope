They found that the atomic heat exceeded the Debye maximum at all temperatures above about 260\u00b0C, suggesting that anharmonic oscillations may be responsible for the deviation from the expected values. Their work is in good agreement with previous measurements by Anderson.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
