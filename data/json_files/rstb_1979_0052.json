The researchers discovered three types of ciliated sensory receptors and described the unique features of the epithelial cells and gland cells covering the tentacles. They also investigated the dense patches of short, stiff cilia on the pallial curtains, which are thought to function as an anti-slip device.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
