The presence of pentagons and heptagons in these structures leads to positive and/or negative curvature. Molecular simulation studies based on curved graphene surfaces are in good agreement with experimental high-resolution transmission electron microscopy observations. These novel materials may have applications in nanoscale engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nanomaterials"}
