King during a voyage to measure the specific gravity of sea-water in various locations in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The author found that the density of ocean water is nearly identical in all parts of the Atlantic between 40\u00b0 South latitude, with exceptions due to local factors. Factors affecting density include dry winds, rainfall, and coastal features. The author compares their findings with other observations made by various researchers.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
