These plants, which include fungi, gymnosperms, and angiosperms, were found in nodules in Hokkaido, Northern Japan. The study offers insights into the structure and relationships of these ancient plants, contributing to the understanding of their role in the Mesozoic era.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
