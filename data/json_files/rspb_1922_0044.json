The authors found that the magnitude of the response is directly related to the strength of the stimulus, and the latent period decreases with increased cortical activity. They also discovered that the refractory period of the reflex is influenced by the effectiveness of the stimulus, and the knee-jerk reflex appears to be an \"all-or-none\" reflex based on the participation of neurones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
