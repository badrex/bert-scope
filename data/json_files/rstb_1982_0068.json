The author explains how damage to specific areas of the visual cortex can lead to selective impairments in perception, such as color, movement, and depth perception. The article highlights the importance of understanding the organization of the visual cortex in both monkeys and humans to better understand the effects of brain damage on visual perception.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Neuropsychology"}
