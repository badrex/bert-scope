The Lighthill acoustic analogy is used to reduce the problem to the simpler one of the diffraction of a plane sound wave by a semi-infinite elastic plate. The solution for the far sound field is developed for the limiting case when a non-dimensional fluid loading parameter tends to zero. The acoustic power of the eddy is increased over its free space value by a factor, where represents the ratio of the natural speed of plate waves in vacuo to the speed of sound. The subsonic surface wave modes, which couple the fluid and plate vibrations, are found to play a significant role in the scattering of aerodynamic sound by elastic half-planes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
