It reveals that tetrodotoxin has a minimal impact on the initial peak of the gating current but causes small changes in the timecourse of its subsequent relaxation. The findings suggest that tetrodotoxin's binding at the outer face of the sodium channel does not interfere with the activation and inactivation mechanisms but has an allosteric effect on the access of internal cations to the channel's inside.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
