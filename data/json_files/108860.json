The discovery includes various species of plants, such as Cinnamomum, Pecopteris, and Sequoia, which are characteristic of the Miocene era. The author also discusses the possible environment and formation of the lignite beds, suggesting that the Bovey basin was once occupied by an inland lake.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
