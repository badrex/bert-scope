The authors use the boundary integral method to derive integral equations and obtain results for crack opening displacement, stress intensity factors, scattered patterns, and frequency spectra of Rayleigh and back-scattered longitudinal waves. The study also compares the plate-type resonance phenomenon with the plane-strain case.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
