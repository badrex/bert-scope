The author uses improved apparatus and techniques to capture detailed images of sound waves and their interactions with different surfaces and lenses. These visualizations help illustrate complex wave phenomena and provide a better understanding of sound wave behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
