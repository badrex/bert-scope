By analyzing the isotopic composition of lead and oxygen in these materials, researchers can determine the possible geographical origins of the ores and materials used, aiding in the understanding of ancient trade networks and the authentication of artworks.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Isotope analysis"}
