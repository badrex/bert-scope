They find that the rate of hydrogen production is proportional to ethylene pressure at low pressures, and decreases as pressure increases. The formation of acetylene is also observed, but it is unlikely to be appreciably polymerized at the low pressures used in the study.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
