They found that a perfect vacuum does not conduct electricity, and the conductivity of air increases as the density of the medium increases. The author also discovered that the color of the electric light changes as the air's rarefaction increases, and the electric fluid's elasticity is vast.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
