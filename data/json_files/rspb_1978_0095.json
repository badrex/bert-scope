They describe the challenges and potential mechanisms for creating synthetic catalysts that mimic the stereochemical precision and efficiency of enzymes. The author outlines a prescription for designing an olefin-hydrating enzyme analogue, emphasizing the importance of an acidic catalyst, a suitable molecular structure, and a non-polar cavity to fit the olefin substrate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
