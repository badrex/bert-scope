The results show that the lower and upper sensitizer limits between 300 and 400 'C are determined by nitrosyl chloride formed from the chloropicrin. The findings suggest that free chlorine atoms are formed during the decomposition of chloropicrin and initiate the chains, unless removed by nitrosyl chloride. The hypothesis is supported by the work described in the following paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and combustion"}
