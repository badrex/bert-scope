The author also explores the relationship between temperature and isothermals, as well as the effects of snow and glaciers on temperature patterns. The study reveals that the climate of the highest elevations in the Alps is less severe than that of high latitudes and more constant than that of polar regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
