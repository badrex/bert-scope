The integration of satellite and conventional oceanographic data can provide a powerful analytical tool for modern ocean research. The article explains the physics and limitations of infrared and visible satellite data, the computer analysis techniques needed to exploit these data, and provides examples of combined satellite and conventional oceanographic data analyses of two ocean regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
