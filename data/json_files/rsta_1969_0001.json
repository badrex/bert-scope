The authors discuss the propagation of acceleration waves in a spherical, elastic Earth with transverse isotropy and consider the effects of self-gravitation on the initial stress. They find that the classical Herglotz-Wiechert method for determining wave speed breaks down in this case, leading to erroneous results.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
