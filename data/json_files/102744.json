He discovered two types of gnats, one with and one without stings, and studied their life cycles. He also observed small, round particles in water that contained other particles and eventually gave birth to more particles, suggesting a form of reproduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
