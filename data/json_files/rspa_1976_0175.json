They found that at low temperatures, nitric oxide adsorbs molecularly, but at higher temperatures, it dissociates into nitrogen and oxygen atoms. The study provides insights into the molecular processes occurring during nitric oxide adsorption and the effect of substrate temperature on these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
