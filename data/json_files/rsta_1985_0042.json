The authors present a model that accounts for the changes in yield stress due to irradiation damage loops and copper precipitates, which may be enhanced by irradiation. The model successfully explains the measurements made on both plate and weld steels in all Magnox stations, providing insights into the behavior of pressure-vessel steels in reactor systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Radiation Hardening"}
