The results showed that afferent and efferent fibers of the vagus nerve can grow and form connections with the peripheral end of the sympathetic nerve. This suggests that there is no essential difference between pre-ganglionic and post-ganglionic fibers in the autonomic nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
