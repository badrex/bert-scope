He proposes a new approach that involves leaving the communication between the nose and eye unobstructed, allowing air and tears to pass through naturally. This method avoids the use of foreign bodies and allows the body's natural healing process to take place.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Ophthalmology"}
