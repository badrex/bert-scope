The authors analyze the isobar model and its agreement with experimental data, as well as the role of angular momentum and wave properties in the reactions. They also explore the connection between the behavior of coefficients and the angular properties of isobar production in the energy range studied.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
