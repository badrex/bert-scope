The author examines their occurrence in various natural and artificial environments, such as lava caves, refrigerating chambers, and breweries. The study compares these ice crystals to other skeleton crystals like rock salt and highlights the importance of calm air for their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
