Using quantal theory, the authors interpret the experimental information and discuss various attachment, detachment, and electron scattering phenomena. The study is important for understanding upper atmospheric and discharge tube phenomena, with implications for the ionosphere and negative ions in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
