They propose that the Sun emits negatively charged particles, which cause auroras and magnetic storms on Earth. The balance of negative and positive charges in the Sun's atmosphere helps regulate the emission of charged particles and their effects on other celestial bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
