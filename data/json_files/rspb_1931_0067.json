They find that the reaction is monomolecular with respect to the hemoglobin concentration and is influenced by pH and temperature. The study provides insights into the oxidation process and its sensitivity to catalysts and environmental factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
