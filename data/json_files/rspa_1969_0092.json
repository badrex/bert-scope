The author modifies Friedrichs' technique to calculate the number of eigenvalues below a given value. The method is demonstrated through various examples, including the Hermit polynomials, Sturm-Liouville problems, and the hydrogen atom's quantum-mechanical theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
