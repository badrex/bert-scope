They propose that this charcoal is introduced into the respiratory system through the air and is absorbed by lymphatic vessels, which transport it to the bronchial glands, causing them to turn black or dark blue. This discovery could have implications for understanding pulmonary consumption and the overall functioning of the respiratory system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
