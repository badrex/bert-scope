Cuckolder males, who mature earlier and do not build nests, have a higher chance of mating with females when they are present in lower densities. Parental males, who delay maturity and build nests, have a higher chance of mating when they are present in higher densities. The success of each strategy depends on the ecological factors and interactions within the colonies. The study also highlights the importance of density-dependent factors and the time constraints of female spawning behavior in the coexistence of these reproductive strategies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
