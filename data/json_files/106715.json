The method is demonstrated and extended from propositions given by Pappus and others. The author also discusses the application of this method to equations involving exponential irrational quantities and provides examples of how this method can be used to demonstrate other mathematical propositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
