W. Johnston, describes a substance called pigotite found in caves on the east and west coast of Cornwall. Pigotite is formed from the decay of plants on moorlands, combining with alumina from decomposed felspar. The author also discusses two acids, mudesous and mudesic, derived from pigotite, and their properties and reactions. These acids have a tendency to precipitate alumina and the protoxide of mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Geochemistry"}
