They found that the oxidation proceeds via successive hydroxylation of the ring to the dihydroxy stage, followed by ring breaking and degradation to C2 hydrocarbons, formaldehyde, carbon oxides, hydrogen, and water. A proposed mechanism involves the instability of a phenol precursor in the region of ignition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
