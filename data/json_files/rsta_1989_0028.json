It explains how convection drives various processes, such as vertical ion drifts, Joule heating, and enhanced neutral air velocities, and how it affects the interpretation of ionospheric observations. The article also examines the connection between convection and different ionospheric processes, such as plasma transport, photoionization, ion chemistry, particle precipitation, ionosphere-thermosphere interactions, and Universal Time variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
