They found that non-polar gases show a steady increase in energy transfer between translation and vibration with rising temperature, while polar gases behave differently, with some showing a rise in transition probability at lower temperatures due to the increasing predominance of oriented collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas Dynamics"}
