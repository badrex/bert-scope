They develop a theoretical and rational analysis using tensor calculus, considering the metal as isotropic and incompressible. The study focuses on the plastico-viscous strains and their effects on the metal's properties, providing insights into the behavior of soft metals under stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
