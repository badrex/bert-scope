The analysis focuses on the mean velocity, mean temperature, and mean skin friction. The results show that the mean flow is affected by the free convection currents, the Eckert number, and the Prandtl number. The Grashof number represents the effects of free convection currents. The mean velocity and mean temperature are shown graphically, and the numerical values of skin friction are provided in a table.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
