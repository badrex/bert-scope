He discovers that the setting force remains constant for any surrounding medium and that the force diminishes as the temperature increases. Faraday also finds that some crystals, like ferrocarbonates of lime, can change their magnetic properties when heated or cooled.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
