The authors analyze the reaction's rate and pressure dependence, concluding that the complex behavior cannot be explained by surface reactions, chain reactions, or the catalytic influence of nitric oxide. Instead, they propose a scheme involving energization of nitrous oxide molecules, transformation to different triplet states, and decomposition of triplets as the rate-controlling steps.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
