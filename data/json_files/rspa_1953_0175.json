The actinometer's high sensitivity and precision depend on the spectrophotometric determination of the photolysis products. The author tested the actinometer's behavior at 3650 to 3663A and found it suitable for use over a wide range of wavelengths. This actinometer can be used to measure small doses of radiation with simplicity and accuracy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectrophotometry"}
