They find that the inactivation of phage T2 occurs due to a failure of DNA injection into host cells, which can be caused by internal cross-linking of DNA by the chloro-ethylamine. This study provides insights into the mechanisms of inactivation and potential applications for further research on alkylating agents and host-virus complexes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
