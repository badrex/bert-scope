They observed the temperature dependence of the Kerr constant and found a value for the hyperpolarizability of molecular hydrogen. This study provides a better understanding of the quantum corrections to the classical formula for the Kerr effect, which is particularly important for hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
