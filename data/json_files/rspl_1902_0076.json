The authors found that the critical velocity of water in small pipes varies directly as the viscosity, and they provided a mathematical equation to describe this relationship. The experiments were conducted over a range of temperatures from 4\u00b0C to 50\u00b0C, and the results were compared with the known variation in the viscosity of water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
