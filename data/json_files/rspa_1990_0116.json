They focus on the properties of type algebras and the linear operator on the Lie algebra so(E) associated with the algebra. The author derives a \"principle of duplicity\" for the ternary multiplication and provides a four-dimensional \"complex\" construction of the algebra.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra and Geometry"}
