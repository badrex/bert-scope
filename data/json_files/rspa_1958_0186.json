They successfully applied new methods for finding heavy atom vectors and combined them with anomalous scattering by mercury atoms to determine the phases of most reflexions out to a spacing of about 6 \u00c5 with a standard error of about 0.2. The resulting electron density projection provides promising prospects for three-dimensional structure analysis at 6 \u00c5 resolution, revealing the internal organization of the haemoglobin molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
