They found that the rate-controlling factor in liquid phase polymerization is the diffusion of monomer to the catalytic surface. The polymerization process is initiated by the formation of free radicals on the sodium surface, with propagation and termination occurring while the polymer is still attached to the sodium. The study provides insights into the factors affecting the rate of polymerization and the properties of the resulting polymers.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
