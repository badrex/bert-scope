He discusses the differences between the growth of roots and the radicle, and how roots elongate by adding new parts to their extremity. Knight also explores the role of alburnum and bark in root and bud formation, and how different environmental factors can affect the growth of roots and buds in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
