They discovered its physical and chemical properties, including its solubility in alkaline solutions and its slight acidity. Turacin has potential applications as a delicate test for alkalies and can change color upon exposure to air and moisture, resembling chlorophyll.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Pigments and Dyes"}
