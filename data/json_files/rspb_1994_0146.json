In species where females are the heterogametic sex, the evolution of ornate male traits occurs more easily due to a variant of the handicap model of sexual selection. This process can happen even when the advantageous alleles for high paternal fitness remain for a short time due to a rapidly changing environment. The theory predicts a phylogenetic bias in the results of sexual selection depending on the underlying genetics of sex determination, which is supported by the observation that elaborate male ornaments are more prevalent in birds than in mammals."}
