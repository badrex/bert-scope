The authors examine the effects of Rontgen rays on the air and vapour, and compare the efficiency of positive and negative ions as condensation nuclei. They also determine the supersaturation levels required for condensation in various organic compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
