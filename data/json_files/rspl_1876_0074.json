They found that some infusions, such as cucumber-infusion, were highly resistant to sterilization, while others, like hay-infusion, could be easily sterilized. The author discovered that the drying and hardening of germs in old hay contributed to its greater resistance to sterilization. This research helped to understand the factors affecting the growth and development of organisms in different types of infusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
