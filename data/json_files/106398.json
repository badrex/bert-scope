They discovered that the color of the thermometer's bulb affects the temperature reading, with blackened bulbs showing a higher temperature in sunlight or strong daylight. The author also observed that the intensity of heat decreases faster than the duplicate proportion of the distances from the flame of a lamp, and that different colors of paint on the thermometer bulbs affect the temperature readings. These findings contribute to the understanding of thermodynamics and the relationship between light and heat."}
