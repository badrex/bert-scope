The research combines these factors into a single theoretical framework and determines the variation in the right ascension of the ascending node of the orbital plane. The findings are relevant to satellites in near-circular orbits at altitudes greater than the effects of both atmospheric oblateness and the diurnal variation are significant.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
