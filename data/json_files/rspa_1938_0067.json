The author describes the experimental setup and results, demonstrating that the beams are ideal for studying resonance effects due to their identical elastic properties along the length and breadth. The findings contribute to a better understanding of piezo-electricity and resonance in crystal beams.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
