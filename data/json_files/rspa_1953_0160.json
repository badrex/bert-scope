The author investigates two systems, a cylinder and a rectangular box, and compares the values of the coefficients and to verify the results. The study provides insights into the magnetic properties of metals and the behavior of electrons in magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
