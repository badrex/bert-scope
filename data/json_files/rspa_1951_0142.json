They found that the reaction rates were affected by temperature, pressure, and the presence of air or water vapor. The main products of the reaction were ethylene and ethane, with smaller amounts of other hydrocarbons. The authors also analyzed the absorption spectrum of mercury diethyl vapor, which helped them understand the reaction mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
