They determined the critical temperature and pressure of argon, its boiling and freezing points, and its density at various states. The author found that argon has a higher density than other permanent gases and can be solidified, making it an interesting addition to the study of gas properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
