Myoepithelium covers the stromal surface of the epithelium of alveoli, ducts, and cisterns, making it more abundant than previously realized. The research investigates the role of myoepithelial contraction in the \"let-down\" phenomenon and milk ejection, finding that other factors like inter-lobular smooth muscle contraction, vascular changes, and elastic recoil of the stroma play minor roles. The study supports the assumption that myoepithelium is the contractile tissue in the mammary gland that responds to a neurohormonal mechanism involving oxytocin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Histology"}
