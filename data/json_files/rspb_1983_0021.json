The structure is very similar to the room-temperature tetragonal form, with differences in the upper part of the active site due to crystal contact. These differences may explain the difficulty of inhibitor-binding in high-temperature orthorhombic crystals but do not reflect the behavior of lysozyme in solution at high temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
