They found that rats could consume sublethal doses of fluorocitrate without harm, and that the liver appeared to reduce the toxicity of fluorocitrate. The metabolism of fluorocitrate in the rat and the urinary excretion of fluoride after a single oral dose were also investigated.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
