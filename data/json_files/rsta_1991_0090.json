It discusses various modeling methods, highlights problem areas, and assesses their application to the phenomenon. The authors emphasize the need for better understanding and prediction of CMEs to improve our knowledge of solar chromospheric and geomagnetic activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
