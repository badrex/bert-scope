The study investigates the sources of volatile components, the nature of rock reservoirs, ambient temperature-pressure and hydraulic conditions, and the history of incremental displacement and fluid activity. The findings provide insights into fluid regimes in lineaments and their influence on geological history and mineralization.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Tectonics"}
