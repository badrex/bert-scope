They explain how increasing the angular aperture improves the visibility of delicate markings on objects by using oblique light, which separates the rays and enhances contrast. The author also discusses the difference between penetrating and defining power in microscopes and how they are related to angular aperture and oblique light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
