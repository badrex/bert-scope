The results contradict earlier systematic hypotheses based on morphological and allozyme data, indicating that nuclear and mitochondrial DNA have evolved differently. The authors propose that Pleistocene events and current ecological factors influencing hybridization among geographically proximal taxa may explain these observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
