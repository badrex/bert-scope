They provide composite solutions for the shearing stress components at the disc and axial flow in the far region, valid for all values of the amplitude parameter. The study covers both low and high-frequency fluctuations and uses the method of matched asymptotic expansions to analyze the flow regimes. The findings can be applied to improve the understanding of fluid dynamics in rotating disc systems and related experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
