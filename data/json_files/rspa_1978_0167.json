These solutions exhibit dependence on two spatial coordinates and time. They find that under certain circumstances, these solutions develop singularities or 'burst' after a finite time. The authors determine the criterion for the development of a 'burst' and explore the nature of the singularities that can develop.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
