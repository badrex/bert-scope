The author measures the velocity of the phase propagation and develops a theory to account for the rate of advance of the superconducting filament, considering the interphase surface tension and the electromagnetic damping effect of eddy currents. The results provide values for the interphase tension and contribute to understanding the factors controlling the phase transition in superconductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
