They found that the chain transfer constant, which indicates the efficiency of solvents in chain transfer reactions, can be used to explain the effect of solvents on the degree of polymerization. The authors also discussed the chemical nature of the solvent transfer reactions and the role of solvent mobility and polarization in chain transfer reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
