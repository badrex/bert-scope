The authors conducted experiments on various types of glass, focusing on flint glasses with high density. They found that the electrical resistance of glass increases with density and approaches a definite chemical composition. This research contributes to the understanding of the electrical properties of materials and their applications in technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
