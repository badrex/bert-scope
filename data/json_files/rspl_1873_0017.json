The authors describe the general and local symptoms of poisoning and conduct experiments on pigeons, guinea pigs, and other animals to understand the differences in the actions of the two venoms on the body's organs. They find that while the general symptoms are similar, there are differences in local symptoms and blood coagulation, which may be due to the different compositions of the venoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
