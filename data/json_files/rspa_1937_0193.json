The authors found that the temperature effect varies between elements, with some showing stronger selective absorption and lower temperature effects, while others show higher values. The study also discusses the relationship between absorption cross-section and neutron velocity, and the role of excited states in neutron absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
