They find that the highest dosage of complement occurs when used against its own corpuscles, and the immune-body's dose with rabbit's complement is the same as with guinea-pig's complement when acting on ox's corpuscles. The study supports the idea that complement's toxic action plays a significant role in hemolysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
