They found that polyethylene exhibited the most distinctive thermoluminescence behavior, with three peaks in the glow curve in the absence of oxygen. The authors also discussed the experimental methods used to produce and analyze the glow curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
