The primary factors controlling these paths are the initial thermal structure, the amount of previously subducted lithosphere, the location of the rock in the subduction zone, and the vigor of mantle wedge convection induced by the subducting slab. The study provides constraints on fluid processes in subduction zones and helps explain the formation of continental crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
