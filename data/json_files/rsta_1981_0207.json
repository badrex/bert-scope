The study of these isotopic anomalies helps to understand nucleosynthesis and trace events during the Solar System's formation. Oxygen isotopes show the largest anomalies and are used to analyze the different groups of meteorites, revealing a complex history of mixing and fractionation processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
