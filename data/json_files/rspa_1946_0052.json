The author conducts laboratory experiments to produce red and yellow sandstones by controlling the physical conditions, such as the presence of air and temperature. The study helps to understand the natural formation of red sandstone and its relation to chalybeate water.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
