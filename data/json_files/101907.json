He found that the blood makes up about 20% of a living lamb's weight and less than 30% of a rabbit's weight. Moulin estimated that a person's heart receives 4 ounces of blood at a time and that 18,000 ounces of blood are transmitted per hour. This discovery helps explain the quick movement of fluids in the body, such as digestion, urine production, and chyle transfer in nursing mothers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
