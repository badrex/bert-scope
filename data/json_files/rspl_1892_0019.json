They explore the use of gelatine-plate cultures to estimate the number of microbes in water and the effectiveness of water purification methods. The authors also touch upon the detection of pathogenic forms like the spirillum of Asiatic cholera and the bacillus of typhoid fever in drinking water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
