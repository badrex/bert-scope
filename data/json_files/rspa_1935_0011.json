They derived vibrational constants and quantum numbers for these systems using the method of least squares. The study provides insights into the electronic transitions and vibrational structure of lead sulphide, which is essential for understanding its physical properties and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
