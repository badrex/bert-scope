The authors describe the design of a cell for measurements on liquids and the ancillary equipment for thermostatting the cell at temperatures from 100 to just above the normal boiling point. They also evaluate existing data in the light of recent work on the effects of radiant heat transfer. Toluene was chosen as a standard fluid due to its long normal liquid range, non-toxicity, and ease of obtaining highly pure at low cost.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
