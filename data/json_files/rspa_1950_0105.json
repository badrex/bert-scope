The author derives the equations of state for an elastic solid deformed to a finite extent from an initial unstressed equilibrium configuration, making use of thermodynamic principles. The results apply to ideally elastic solids in general motion, and to non-ideally elastic solids when in equilibrium or subjected to changes only.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
