The liquid exhibited various and sometimes vortical motions, even when cold. The author also observed that the liquid's movement was affected by the presence of air. This odd liquid sparked curiosity and further investigation into its properties and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fluid dynamics"}
