They found that Emoia cyanura and Emoia impar, two species of skinks, have multiple genetically different lineages but similar appearances. This finding challenges the assumption that morphologically similar species have recently diverged and suggests a genetic review of Pacific skink systematics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
