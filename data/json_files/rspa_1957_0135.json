They explore the relation between classical and quantized fields and the boundary conditions that can be applied to field equations. The authors prove that the quantized inaccessibility condition holds for quantized fields satisfying linear equations and discuss its implications for interacting fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
