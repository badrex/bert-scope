They discovered that injecting rabbits with a saline dilution of an alcohol-ether extract of tubercle bacilli could produce complement-fixation bodies. The results showed that digestion of the alcohol-ether extract with inhibitive serum inhibited the production of specific sensitisers. This research contributed to the understanding of immunological states in animals and their correlation with clinical conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
