They used a specialized apparatus to measure the force exerted by a non-homogeneous magnetic field on the crystal specimens and deduced the susceptibility from the force and the mass of the specimen. The results provide insights into the magnetic properties of these materials and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
