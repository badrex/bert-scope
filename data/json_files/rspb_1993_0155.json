They find that mechanistic models, which can induce chaotic solutions, outperform stochastic models in forecasting epidemics. The study also shows that simple mechanistic models are as effective as more detailed schemes that include age structure. The results suggest that chaotic behavior plays a role in childhood epidemics and can be used to improve disease prediction models.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
