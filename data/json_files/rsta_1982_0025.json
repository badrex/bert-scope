It examines the tectonic processes that led to the formation of sedimentary basins and their relationship to hydrocarbon occurrences. The study covers the major geological elements, structural cross-sections, and the regional isopachs of the Jurassic, Cretaceous, and Tertiary within the main basinal areas.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Sedimentary Basins"}
