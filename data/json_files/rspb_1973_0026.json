This process is essential for understanding how nerve impulses transmit information between cells. The study used squid giant synapses to investigate the role of calcium ions in the release of neurotransmitters and how they affect the transmission of signals between nerve cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
