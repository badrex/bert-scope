The observations were conducted in France and involved the use of triangulation and astronomical measurements. The author discusses the methods, instruments, and results of these observations, comparing them to other sets of observations made in different parts of France. The main focus is on the observations made near the Arctic Circle, which revealed a significant difference in the Earth's figure compared to previous findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
