The authors explore the use of plant genes encoding protease inhibitors and their effectiveness in protecting plants against insect attack. They also discuss the potential of combining different resistance genes to improve the effectiveness of protection. The article highlights the importance of developing alternative strategies to pesticide usage for crop protection and the potential benefits of using transgenic plants in integrated pest control programs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Genomics"}
