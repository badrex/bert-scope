They found that radiation accelerates the decomposition process and reduces the time to explosion. The results indicate that radiation can sensitize lead azide to a thermal initiation method, such as a 'hot spot' produced by impact, friction, or needle prick.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
