He discovered that they give either a continuous spectrum or a spectrum with one, two, or three bright lines. Huggins also developed a method to estimate the intrinsic brightness of some nebulae, finding that they consist of luminous gas in masses. This research contributes to the understanding of the gaseous nature of these celestial bodies and the possibility of periodic brightness variations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
