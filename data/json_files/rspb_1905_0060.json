They discovered that lecithin, a complex fatty substance, plays a significant role in the utilization of fatty reserves during germination. The authors also found that lecithin increases during germination and remains constant during the absorption of fatty reserves by the seedling, suggesting its formation during the germinative process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
