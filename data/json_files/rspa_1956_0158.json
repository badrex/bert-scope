They used a system with a capillary tube and a proportional counter to detect alpha-particles after traversing a water film. The results showed that the differential stopping power of water is in agreement with Bragg's law and is the same as that of an equivalent mixture of hydrogen and oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
