It suggests that the continental crust has grown through time by the accretion of island arcs and the addition of the andesitic volcanic suite. The irreversible differentiation of the mantle has produced new continental crust during several short episodes separated by time, possibly of global extent.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Plate Tectonics"}
