They examine the characteristics of the single particle motion, such as the intervals between velocity vector changes and the amplitude of quasi-oscillations. The study provides insights into the nature of the liquid state and may contribute to the development of realistic physical models.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
