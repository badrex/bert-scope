They observe that the irregularities in barometric height from day to day are due to different causes, such as changes in the direction of the action of the cause that produces similar and simultaneous movements within the tropics. The author also notes that as they approach the poles, the amount and irregularity of barometric oscillations seem to increase.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
