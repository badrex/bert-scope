The author criticizes previous research and provides new insights into the structure and function of the nervous system, including the presence of a continuous plexus around the Actinia and beneath each chromatophore. The article also discusses the minute structure of muscular fibers and their attached fibrous tissue in the base of Actinia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
