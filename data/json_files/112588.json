They then explore different variations of the reaction, including using aniline and acetic acid, and propose a general method for producing a variety of similar compounds. The author also discusses the mechanism of the reaction and the properties of the resulting substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
