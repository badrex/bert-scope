It introduces the concept of gene identity by descent and explores the use of kinship coefficients and probabilities of joint descent of founder genes as alternative ways to characterize relationships between individuals. The author also highlights the limitations of using gene identity state probabilities as a parametrization of genealogy and suggests using generalized kinship coefficients as a more natural and efficient summary of genealogical structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
