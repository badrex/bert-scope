The elements were introduced to depths of about 30 nm, and the results showed that rare-earth implants improved oxidation resistance while lead and tin caused small increases. The findings suggest several possibilities, including the formation of mixed oxide compounds, blocking the migration paths of vacancies, and altering the grain size to improve ductility.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Oxidation Resistance"}
