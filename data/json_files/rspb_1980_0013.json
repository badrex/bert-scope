This layer, consisting mainly of glycoprotein with neutral polysaccharide, remains inert even after exposure to extreme conditions. The mucus layer, combined with the fish's cautious behavior during acclimation, provides protection from the anemone's stinging response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
