They develop a systematic geometric method to exploit conservation laws and prolongation structures. The method is applied to a general 3-scattering problem, which is reduced to three sub-2 problems and their conservation laws. This approach provides a coherent understanding of soliton physics using simple differential geometric ideas and the calculus of exterior differential forms.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
