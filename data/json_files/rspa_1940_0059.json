They used this apparatus to study the velocity distribution of thermal energy neutrons from a wax \"howitzer\" and investigated the variation of absorption coefficients of boron and cadmium with neutron velocity. This method provided a more accurate and precise way to study slow neutrons and their interactions with materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
