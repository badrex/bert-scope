The results show that at higher densities, the temperatures obtained by both methods are nearly identical, while at lower densities, the differences are remarkable. The author suggests that the explanation for this difference may be due to the dissociation of carbonic anhydride and aqueous vapor at low pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
