The researchers found that charcoal expands by about 0.75% when exposed to one atmosphere of carbon dioxide. The expansion is of the same order as the moisture expansion in building materials, which may have wider implications for the understanding of rigid gels. The results show that the expansion is reversible and independent of the direction of the change in gas pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
