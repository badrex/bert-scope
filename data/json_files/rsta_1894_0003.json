They explore various methods for breaking up abnormal frequency-curves and suggest that using the first five or six moments of the frequency-curve can lead to good results. The author also mentions the possibility of other methods leading to similar results, but has not yet discovered them.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
