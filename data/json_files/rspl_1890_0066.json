The confusion arose from the fact that Sceparnodon was based on upper incisors, while Phascolonus was based on lower jaws. The author provides evidence from a collection of fossils from Miall Creek, Australia, which supports the idea that these two genera are one and the same.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Paleontology"}
