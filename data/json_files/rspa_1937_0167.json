The authors develop a method to determine the stability of the plate by considering the equilibrium stresses and displacements caused by applying a uniform shearing force to the two straight edges. They use shell equations and Fourier series to analyze the problem and provide a solution that satisfies the boundary conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics of Materials"}
