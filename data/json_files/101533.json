The dye is obtained by spreading the ripe grain on linen, separating the red powder, and exposing it to the sun. The resulting dye is used for coloring wool. The author also notes that if the powder is not treated with an acid, it forms small flies that change color before dying.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
