The author presents two theorems that demonstrate the inevitability of singularities under certain conditions, such as the strong causality assumption and the energy-momentum tensor obeying the usual inequality. The nature of these singularities is also explored, and it is suggested that they may indicate a breakdown of the Einstein theory in very strong fields rather than the actual occurrence of singularities in the universe."}
