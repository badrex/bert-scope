It explores the social and historical context of his lectures at King's College in the 1830s and challenges the traditional interpretation of his resignation. The author argues that Lyell's appointment and resignation should be understood in terms of the professionalization of science and the social responsibility of scientists, rather than as a conflict between science and religion.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences, Art, and Humanities > History of Science"}
