The authors study the interaction of dislocations with intrinsic and extrinsic defects in non-doped rutile and rutile doped with trivalent cations, such as chromium and aluminum. They use transmission electron microscopy and high-resolution electron microscopy to analyze the microstructure and correlate it with the material's deformation behavior. The results provide insights into the mechanical properties and potential applications of rutile in various industries.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
