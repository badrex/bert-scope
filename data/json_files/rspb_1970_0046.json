They found that when cell division is induced in mouse liver and kidney, a change in masking in chromatin occurs before changes in RNA populations and DNA synthesis. This suggests that histones non-specifically mask DNA, and non-histone proteins are essential to reverse masking in a specific way.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
