The GP90 vaccine, when combined with the adjuvant saponin, provides protection in both mice and marmosets. The vaccine is effective against the naturally infective insect-metacyclic form and various strains of T. cruzi, but does not achieve sterile immunity. The study highlights the importance of cell surface antigens in sub-unit vaccines and the potential role of GP90 in controlling human protozoal diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
