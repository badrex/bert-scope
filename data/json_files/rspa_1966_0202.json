They use a group theoretic method to analyze the interactions and find that it is impossible for massless particles of unique spin to be coupled minimally to gravitation unless the spin is less than S, space-time is conformally flat, or the spin is two and it describes gravitational radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
