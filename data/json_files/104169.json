This surprising property was examined and confirmed by professors Albinus and Mussenbrock. The insect was also mentioned in a letter from Monsieur Buffon, who shared two other singular observations in natural history. The full potential and mechanisms of this regeneration are yet to be explored.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Invertebrate Zoology"}
