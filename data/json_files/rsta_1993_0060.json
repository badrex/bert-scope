The authors studied three sites with different water column and seabed characteristics. They found that seston concentration was determined by local resuspension and advection of a regional horizontal concentration gradient. The resuspended particles were derived from a thin layer of material (fluff) on the seabed, which was relatively enriched in organic carbon. The authors also discovered that storm resuspension of fine sediments may be self-limiting due to self-stratification of the boundary layer by resuspended fine sediment.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
