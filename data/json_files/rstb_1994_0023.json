The endothelium metabolizes various vasoactive substances, converts angiotensin I to angiotensin II, and secretes potent vasodilators like prostacyclin and EDRF (nitric oxide) and vasoconstrictor peptide endothelin-1. The balance between these mediators determines the cardiovascular system's response in diseases like hypertension, atherosclerosis, and myocardial infarction. The author also highlights the discovery of angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, which are valuable drugs for treating hypertension and heart failure.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
