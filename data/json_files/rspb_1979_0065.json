These particles, called calyx particles, are responsible for providing resistance to the parasitoid's egg against the host insect's defense reactions. The particles are composed of a protein-carbohydrate ratio of 100:17 and have a hollow cylindrical structure. The resistance mechanism is due to the presence of glycoproteins in the particles, which can be applied to eggs to increase their resistance to host defenses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
