They provide evidence that these roots were appendages of the stem and discuss the characteristics that distinguish them from ordinary branches of the plant. The study contributes to our understanding of the organization and development of these ancient plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
