The authors explore the evaporation, condensation, and recovery of potassium sulphate in an m.h.d. combustion chamber, as well as the impact of fuel impurities on the process. They also examine the potential for separating potassium from exhaust gases and the effects of coal and residual fuel oil on the m.h.d. system.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy Conversion"}
