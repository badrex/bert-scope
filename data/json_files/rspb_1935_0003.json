The research shows that fibrillation is caused by a lack of coordination between contracting cells and the presence of excess potassium, calcium, or magnesium. The study also demonstrates that fibrillation and coordinated beating can occur simultaneously in the same heart, and that localized fibrillation is a distinguishing feature of this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
