This finding suggests that the widely used method for determining phytoplankton productivity may underestimate the true rate of fixation. The implications of this discovery for understanding trophic relationships in aquatic habitats are considered to be considerable.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
