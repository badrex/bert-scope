They found that the death rate due to selective destruction was about 77,000 between the age corresponding to a carapace length of 7mm and maturity, as a consequence of deviations in frontal breadths. The study provides a method that can be applied to various cases, but it is not suitable for rapid changes induced by selection or environmental changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
