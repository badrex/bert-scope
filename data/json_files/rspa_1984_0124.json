The authors propose a two-strut elastic model to explain the compression splitting failure mode, which is supported by finite element and boundary element calculations. The model helps to understand the role of pre-crack length and platen width in controlling the failure mode transition.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
