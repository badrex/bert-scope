Researchers collected data on blood groups, serum proteins, and red cell enzymes from different communities and used genetic distance measures to analyze the results. The findings showed that linguistic and genetic information had a strong correlation, and the genetic distances between populations could be used to estimate the times of separation of related New Guinean groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Genetics"}
