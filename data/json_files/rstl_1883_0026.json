They found that the proportion of total fat and total nitrogenous substance varies among different animals, and the increase in weight during the fattening process consists of less nitrogenous substance and more fat. The authors also estimated the proportion of fat and nitrogenous substance consumed as human food and compared it to wheat-flour bread, concluding that animal food contributes a higher proportion of non-nitrogenous substance to one of nitrogenous substance than bread.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Food Science"}
