C. Wooldridge, discusses the coagulation of blood and identifies a substance called A-fibrinogen as a crucial factor in initiating coagulation. They also differentiate between three coagulable bodies in the plasma: A-, B-, and C-fibrinogen. The author challenges the previous notion that coagulation is a fermentative process, instead comparing it to crystallization.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
