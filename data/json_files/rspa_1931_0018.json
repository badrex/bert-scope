They found that the water bands sharpen and shift towards shorter wavelengths as temperature and electrolyte concentration increase. This research provides insights into the molecular structure and interactions of water and electrolytes under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
