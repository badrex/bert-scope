The authors develop a new approach to calculate the absorption coefficient, which is based on the interaction between an electron and a positive nucleus. They compare their results with previous works and discuss potential applications to stellar environments. The study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind continuous absorption and contributes to the development of more accurate models for astrophysical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
