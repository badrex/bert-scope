They discovered that this change is due to thermal softening of the brass by frictional heating. The overall wear mechanism remains the same, with a film of transferred brass built up on the steel surface and metallic debris produced. The authors also studied the influence of temperature on the wear rate and found that it plays a significant role in the wear process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Tribology"}
