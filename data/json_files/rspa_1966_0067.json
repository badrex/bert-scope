They discovered that even a small amount of surface-active material can set up gradients of surface tension, which significantly damps the eddies and reduces the rate of surface renewal, thus slowing down mass transfer across the liquid surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
