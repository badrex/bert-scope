The authors use theoretical analysis and model simulations to show that the distribution of conservative tracers is primarily determined by the residual circulation pattern. They also discuss the distribution of non-conservative tracers and the transport of suspended sediments in the region. The study provides insights into understanding the North Sea system and its environmental processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
