The authors analyze the effects of radiation on soil particles and water, considering three categories of particle sizes and their movement during the heating process. They also discuss the potential for convective mixing and the formation of a hot layer beneath the ambient air. The study provides a foundation for understanding the complex interactions between soil, water, and radiation during intense heating events."}
