These equations do not fit the present inverse formalism or possess the properties associated with it, such as Backlund transformations. The most interesting new Korteweg-de Vries equation has -soliton solutions, and the authors suggest that higher-order scattering problems could be a future area of research.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations"}
