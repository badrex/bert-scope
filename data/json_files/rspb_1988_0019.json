They discovered that different species of mRNA code for receptors to GABA and glycine, and possibly separate P-alanine receptors. The pharmacological properties of the three amino acid responses also differed, suggesting distinct receptor types.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
