The results show that TRH differentially affects on- and OFF-center cells, suppressing the maintained activity and light response in ON-center cells and enhancing it in OFF-center cells. This suggests that TRH may play a role in light adaptation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
