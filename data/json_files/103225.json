Sherard reported the formation of a new island near Sant-Erini in the Archipelago. The island was formed by volcanic activity under the sea, which had occurred several times in the past. The new island was growing in size as more rocks and materials were thrown up by the volcano. This phenomenon was accompanied by earthquakes, smoke, and flames, making it a significant geological event of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
