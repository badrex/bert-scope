They find that during glacial stages, trade winds were more vigorous north of the Cape Verdes, while the wintertime Harmattan was weaker south of the Cape Verdes. The study also reveals that the land north of Dakar remained arid during glacials, while the land south of Dakar oscillated between desert during interglacials and savannah during glacials.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
