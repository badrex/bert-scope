The researchers found that the quantum yield for ozone photolysis was virtually independent of ozone pressure for any oxygen mixture, and the energy transfer mechanism for singlet oxygen formation is likely operative. These findings contribute to understanding atmospheric ozone photolysis and its implications for the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Science"}
