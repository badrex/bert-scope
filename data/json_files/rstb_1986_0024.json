It explains how plants grow by iterating modular units and how their growth can be described in terms of the population dynamics of these structural units. The article also examines the reproductive schedules of plants and the pattern of mortality at the module and genet level.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
