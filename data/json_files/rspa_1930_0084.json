The authors analyze the effects of higher power laws of force on scattering and discuss the potential role of inverse fifth and sixth power attractive forces, as well as higher power repulsive forces. The study focuses on the scattering of magnesium and aluminum, with the authors suggesting that further experimental data is needed to validate their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear and Particle Physics"}
