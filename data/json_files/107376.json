He compared his results with Dr. Bradley's 1756 catalog and found that the error in the earlier catalog did not exceed a quarter of a second. He also provided a table with mean barometer and thermometer readings for easy correction in other refraction tables.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrometry"}
