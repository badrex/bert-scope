He investigates the magnetic phenomena resulting from the hypothesis of the duality of poles and discusses the implications of the findings. However, due to the uncertainty of the observations and the influence of geological and meteorological disturbances, the author hesitates to draw definitive conclusions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
