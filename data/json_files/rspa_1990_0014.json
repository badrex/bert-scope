They demonstrate that stability of a relative equilibrium is implied by the definiteness of the second variation of a modified Hamiltonian restricted to an appropriate subspace. The analysis applies to various materials, including St Venant-Kirchhoff and Ciarlet-Geymonat materials, and reveals both stable and unstable equilibria for compressible Mooney-Rivlin materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
