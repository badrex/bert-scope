They found that the distortion is produced in the frequency region of the higher stimulus tone and then filtered by a structure tuned to a frequency just over half an octave below that tone. The tectorial membrane is suggested as the responsible structure, supporting theories of cochlear mechanics that involve resonances interacting to enhance frequency selectivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience", "sub_discipline": "Auditory System"}
