They analyze the behavior of these lines under different experimental conditions, such as in vacuum tube and spark spectra, and find that the lines are not due to air but are strongly connected to silicium in some form. The author concludes that the Group IV lines are present in the spectra of belt stars of Orion and other stellar spectra, supporting their identity with stellar lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
