The cone has a unique structure with compound branched sporo-phylls, each bearing a number of sporangia. The study of this new cone helps in understanding the taxonomy and morphology of fossil plants, particularly those from the Carboniferous formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
