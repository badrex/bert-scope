This method is based on the leading theorem in the Calculus of Derivations and can be applied to various types of equations, including finite, irrational, and transcendental ones. The new method offers greater accuracy and simplicity compared to popular methods of approximation, as it takes into account all the derivatives, not just the first and second ones.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Calculus"}
