The authors collected samples in 1924 and 1961 from the same locations in Bundoran, Ireland, to compare the state of the populations. The results show a state of apparent evolutionary stability, with no consistent evolutionary changes observed over the 37-year period. The study provides valuable information about the role of natural selection in microevolutionary change.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Population Genetics"}
