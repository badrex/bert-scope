This method can be applied to both visible and ultra-violet spectra, allowing for the study of the structure of broadened lines and the investigation of stellar spectra. The author also discusses the calibration and creation of gratings for use in spectrophotometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
