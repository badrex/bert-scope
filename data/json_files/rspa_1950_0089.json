Their measurements support the assumption that the 2Sj term is higher than predicted by the Dirac theory, and they provide evidence for the shift of the 2Sj term. The results agree with the latest values found by Lamb and Retherford from microwave measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
