The authors develop a method to calculate magnetic shielding at points outside the molecule and show that higher multipolar terms become important as the field-point approaches the molecule. They also derive formulae for the observables using second-order quantum mechanical perturbation theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
