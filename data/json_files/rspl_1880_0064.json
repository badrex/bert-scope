Tyndall conducted experiments on the action of an intermittent beam of radiant heat on gaseous matter. He examined eighty different liquids and verified that they produced musical sounds. He also determined the absorptions exerted by the vapours of more than twenty of these liquids using thermometric expansion. The investigation showed the harmony and mutual support between two series of experiments conducted using different methods. The results confirmed the validity of his previous experiments on aqueous vapour.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
