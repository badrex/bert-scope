They find that the triangular fibrous plate in the fox is similar to the basal part of the \"marsupial\" bone in Phalangista vulpina. The epipubic ligament is considered a structure of the same order as the rudimentary clavicle and the rudimentary hallux of Canidae, representing the remains of an organ that was fully developed in ancestral forms of the group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
