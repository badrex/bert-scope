The research reveals that despite lecithotrophic development, I. quadrivalvis retains a relatively generalized arrangement of naupliar and cypris muscles and a generalized transition from one to the other. The findings provide a comparison with the more extreme histolysis and replacement of the musculature in Semibalanus balanoides and contribute to the understanding of muscle metamorphosis in thoracican barnacles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
