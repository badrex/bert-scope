The authors use numerical models to calculate the temperature dependence of geochemical reactions involving steroid hydrocarbons and compare these predictions with observed reaction extents in sediment samples. The results provide insights into the temperature history of the sediments and the reactions affecting sedimentary organic matter, contributing to a better understanding of petroleum generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
