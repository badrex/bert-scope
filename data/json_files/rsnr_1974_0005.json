The author explores Bayes' notebook, which contains notes on various mathematical texts, tables of numbers, and a section on ancient units of length measurement. The article also examines Bayes' comments on the ideas of Benjamin Hoadly and Benjamin Wilson, which touch on the central difficulties in electrical theory at the time, concerning the role and existence of electrical atmospheres. The author confirms and completes the decipherment of Bayes' shorthand used in these manuscripts, revealing his insights on electrical and mathematical theories of the time.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Probability theory", "sub_discipline": "Statistics > Bayesian statistics"}
