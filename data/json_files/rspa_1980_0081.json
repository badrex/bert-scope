They used single configuration Hartree-Fock calculations to analyze the differences between the doubly excited series in Ca I, Sr I, and Mg I. The results showed that the centrifugal barrier influences the wavefunction properties, leading to differences in the appearance of the spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
