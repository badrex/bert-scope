The authors investigate the instability and bursting of soap films under the influence of an electric field, considering various modes of failure and the impact of film length. The findings provide insights into the behavior of charged films and have implications for understanding and controlling instabilities in similar systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
