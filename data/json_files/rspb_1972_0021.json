They found that spleen cells from heavily paralyzed animals regained reactivity when transferred into lethally irradiated recipients. This suggests the existence of \"tolerant\" or paralyzed cells, which can be reversibly blocked by the presence of polysaccharide.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
