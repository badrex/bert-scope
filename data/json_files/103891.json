The experiments involved using a machine with an iron bar and various props to measure the pressure and analyze the effects of the prop's length, angle, and distance from the center of motion. The results provided insights into the mechanics of raising heavy objects and the role of friction in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
