They used surgical techniques and traced the distribution of arterial blood to identify the regions responsible for osmotic regulation. The study concluded that the osmoreceptors are likely located in the hypothalamus, specifically in the thalamic paraventricular nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
