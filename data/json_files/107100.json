He experimented with different liquids to transmit solar rays and improve thermometrical observations. The author also noticed a possible asymmetry in the Sun's emission and discussed the potential implications for understanding the Sun's behavior and its impact on Earth's climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
