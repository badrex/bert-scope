The author examines the feeding habits, skeletal structures, and evolutionary relationships between the Asteroidea and Ophiuroidea groups of starfish, providing insights into the early development of echinoderm stocks. The study is based on fossil remains found in Western Europe and Bohemia, offering a comprehensive understanding of the early history of starfish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Paleontology"}
