They discussed the isolation and purification of virus particles, particle size, serological reactions, and the relationship between virus strains and host plants. The researchers also examined the behavior of virus strains when mixed with other viruses and tested on different host plants, providing insights into the complex interactions between viruses and their hosts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Virology"}
