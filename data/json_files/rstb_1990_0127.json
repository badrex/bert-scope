The authors describe the development of a forecasting service and an expert system to predict the occurrence of outbreaks, as well as the use of historical data to create rules of thumb for forecasting. The main challenges in forecasting armyworm outbreaks remain the carry-over from one season to the next and understanding moth migration and behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
