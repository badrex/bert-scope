This supports the 'good genes' model of sexual selection, where ornaments signal overall health and genetic quality. The research was conducted on a natural population of swallows, and the results showed that the selection on tail length was not due to selection on correlated characters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
