They extended the study to the ultra-violet portion of the spectrum and detected weak lines using photography. The research involved a modified apparatus for automatic operation during long exposures and the use of diffraction gratings and prism spectroscopes for analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
