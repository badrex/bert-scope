The research explores the adaptive and lethal processes in liquid media and on agar plates, suggesting that the resistance is not due to pre-existing mutants but rather the result of a competition between adaptive and lethal processes. The findings support the adaptive hypothesis for the development of drug resistance with this agent and organism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
