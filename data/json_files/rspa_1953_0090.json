They found that the majority of radioactive ions carried a negative charge, and when these ions were swept away, positive ions of 80Br produced by isomeric transition were stable. The results showed that electric fields can inhibit the recombination of positive ions, leading to a better understanding of the chemical reactions induced by nuclear events.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiochemistry"}
