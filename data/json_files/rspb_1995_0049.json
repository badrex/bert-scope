Despite assistance from a competitor, Echinometra viridis, the species' population remained low ten years after the event. This demonstrates that unique disturbance events can have long-lasting effects on species abundance, independently of community-level processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
