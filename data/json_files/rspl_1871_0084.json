They found that only a few elementary substances, such as alkali metals, iodine, sulfur, and phosphorus, were soluble in ammonia. Additionally, they observed that salts, particularly those containing mercury, exhibited unique behavior when exposed to the liquid. The study aimed to understand the general solvent properties and chemical reactions of ammonia.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
