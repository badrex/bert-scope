The author highlights the significance of studying both the matrix and the fluid in diagenesis, as it is one of the few processes where both can be directly observed. The author also mentions the challenges of obtaining water analyses and the need for more research in this area.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Sedimentary Geology"}
