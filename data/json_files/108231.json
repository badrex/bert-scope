They discovered methods to create larger, more accurate reflecting surfaces using a combination of castings and soldering. This allowed for the creation of a three-foot aperture speculum, which could potentially be expanded further. The author's work aimed to increase the optical power of instruments, advancing practical astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optical Engineering"}
