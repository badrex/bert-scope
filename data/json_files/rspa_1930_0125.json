They find that charges arise when two identical surfaces are rubbed together, and the charges change in amount and sign systematically. The effects are attributed to progressive strain on the surface caused by pressure and friction. The authors also study the influence of temperature and atmospheric conditions on the triboelectric effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material properties"}
