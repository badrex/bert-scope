They found that the inheritance of these characters followed Mendelian laws, with some exceptions. The study also explored the influence of environmental factors on the type of fusion and the behavior of the fusion nucleus in the fungi.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
