They created a sparking vessel that allowed for a steady flow of liquid and a spark between two liquids, which produced a spectrum representative of the bulk solution. They also introduced the use of an internal standard to account for variations in exposure and electrical conditions, allowing for more accurate quantitative analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
