The author presents several cases where individuals drowned without water in their lungs, suggesting that other factors, such as lack of oxygen or stomach contents, may cause drowning. This research raises questions about the understanding of drowning at the time and provides a foundation for further study on the topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
