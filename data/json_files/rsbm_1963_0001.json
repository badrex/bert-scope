He made significant contributions to the development of X-ray crystallography, including the Astbury-Yardley tables of space groups and the a-ray absorption intensity gauge. Astbury's work laid the foundation for the study of complex organic structures and played a crucial role in the growth of molecular biology as a scientific discipline.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
