It discusses various instruments and techniques used, such as filter radiometers, grating spectrometers, and Michelson interferometers, and highlights their applications in atmospheric studies. The article also describes a recent balloon experiment that carried infrared spectrometers into the stratosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
