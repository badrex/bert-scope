They observed a decrease in the longitudinal optic mode frequency at small wavevectors, which is attributed to the screening of the macroscopic electric field by the free carriers in the crystal. The authors used rigid ion models and shell models to estimate the interatomic forces of lead sulphide and found a similarity between the results obtained for lead sulphide and lead telluride.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
