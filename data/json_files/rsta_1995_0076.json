These shifts are in contrast to the relatively stable climate of the past 10,000 years and highlight the potential for significant thresholds in the Earth's atmosphere-ocean-cryosphere system. The relationship between these climate changes and the North Atlantic ocean circulation is also explored, along with possible correlations with climate change in North-West Europe.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
