The authors describe how SRP and SRP receptor work together to mediate the specific attachment of translating ribosomes to the microsomal membrane, allowing for the translocation of proteins across the endoplasmic reticulum. This process is essential for the correct topogenesis of specific proteins in living cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
