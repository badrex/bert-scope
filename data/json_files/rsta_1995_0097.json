The study demonstrates that these initial non-uniformities generate gradients in the distribution of chemical ignition times, creating a high-speed, shockless reaction wave. If the gradients are large enough, a transition from the high-speed reaction wave to a strong detonation occurs. The author presents an asymptotic derivation of the spontaneous flame concept, which accounts for the presence of initial velocity and pressure disturbances, and investigates the unsteady structure of the high-speed reaction wave."}
