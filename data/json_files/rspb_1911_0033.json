They discovered that these interactions can be described by mathematical equations and developed a formula to explain the phenomenon of \"diversion.\" This research provides a deeper understanding of the underlying principles of serum reactions and has implications for the study of immunology and related fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
