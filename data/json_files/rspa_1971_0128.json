They show that the response is the same as that due to excitation by a transient force, simplifying the solution of vibration problems involving time-dependent boundary conditions. The concepts of effective modal stiffness and effective modal mass are also elucidated.", "scientific_discipline": "Mechanical Engineering > Vibration Analysis"}
