They found that the presence of impurities, such as phosphorus, arsenic, and lead, significantly reduces the conductivity of copper. The authors also discovered that annealing copper wires can improve their conductivity. This research helps in understanding the properties of copper and its alloys for various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
