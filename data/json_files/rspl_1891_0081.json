Experiments on stimulation of the cortex cerebri show that the block in the spinal cord persists even with a return of associated movements. This research contributes to the understanding of the origin and course of certain long and short tract fibers in the spinal cord.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
