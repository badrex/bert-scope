They discovered that the size distribution of cells in cultures giving snake-forms follows an exponential law, which suggests that cell division is delayed due to a less probable conjunction of events inside the cell. The study also found that the balance and adaptive variation of enzyme processes in bacteria play a crucial role in determining cell morphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
