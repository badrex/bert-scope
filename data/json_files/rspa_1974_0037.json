They observed a complex spectrum and interpreted it in terms of different lattice sites. The results indicate a significant degree of covalency between the rare-earth ions and the lattice. The authors also found that all spectra in zinc selenide are damage-sensitive, which helped them determine a threshold energy for zinc displacement and an activation energy for thermal annealing.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
