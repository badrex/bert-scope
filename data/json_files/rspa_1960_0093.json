They present two methods, one being a direct generalization of the Hartree-Fock method, to satisfy the Pauli conditions on the first-order and second-order matrices. The methods are applicable to one-dimensional spin variational methods and can be useful for understanding electron gas behavior across various densities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
