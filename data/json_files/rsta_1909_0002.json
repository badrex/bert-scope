The author describes the chemical examination of scandium compounds and its separation from other rare earths. The main focus is on the mineral wiikite, which contains a high amount of scandium. The author provides a detailed process for extracting scandium from wiikite and discusses its atomic weight and properties, such as its spectrum and radioactive nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Rare Earth Elements"}
