It emphasizes that the emphasis on internal mechanisms in terrestrial studies and external physical forcing in marine populations can provide a partial description of the diverse temporal patterns observed. The article suggests that the coupling between different scales, rather than the nature of internal or external processes themselves, can help explain the variety of patterns found in both marine and terrestrial systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
