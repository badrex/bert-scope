They found that the number of triethylphosphine molecules fixed by these derivatives is determined by the number of chlorine equivalents they contain. The author also discovered that these compounds can form a variety of chlorinated phosphonium bases, and that the final products of the reaction depend on the relative proportions of the agents used.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organophosphorus Chemistry"}
