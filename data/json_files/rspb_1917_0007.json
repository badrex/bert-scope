They found that the presence of auximones significantly increased the growth and health of the plants, with a 197% increase in number over the control group. Microscopic investigation also revealed differences in the internal structure of the plants, with more compact tissues and fewer air spaces in the auximone-treated plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
