It covers a range of topics, from bacterial genetics to plant incompatibility systems, highlighting the significance of cell surface genetics in cell biology, growth control, hormonal activity, immunology, and development. The article also emphasizes the potential for learning from one system to contribute to the understanding of another, and the possibility of a genetic classification of cellular systems based on clusters of closely linked genes with related functions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
