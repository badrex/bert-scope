They develop a model to study the equilibrium morphology of interconnected porosity and discuss its implications for processes like sintering and gas release in nuclear fuel. The study shows that interconnected pore stability is affected by variations in grain size, and the intermediate stage of sintering may end at higher pore volumes than previously thought.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Porosity and Sintering"}
