The authors describe an apparatus and its theory, determining the drift velocity, mean free path, and energy loss in collisions with gas molecules. The results provide a better understanding of the properties of the ionosphere and improve the accuracy of previous measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
