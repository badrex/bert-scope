They derive explicit solutions for the spectrum of turbulence under stationary and non-stationary conditions. The study focuses on the decay of turbulence and the behavior of the Reynolds number during the decay process. The author's findings provide a more comprehensive understanding of the spectrum and the energy transfer between eddies in turbulent media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
