The first shock was felt throughout the city, while the second one happened shortly after. Although no significant damage was reported in Martyn's neighborhood, the earthquake was strongly felt in Fulham and Turnham-Green. Some people also noticed unusual appearances in the air before the earthquake, but this observation was not well-attested.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
