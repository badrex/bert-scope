The authors analyze language performance in brain-damaged patients to understand how different aspects of language are processed and how they communicate with each other. The study concludes that there is a modular organization of the nervous system, with distinct channels of communication between independent components of the mental lexicon.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Psychology"}
