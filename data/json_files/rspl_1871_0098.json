Pengelly, explored the Brixham Cave in England. They discovered remains of the Reindeer above the so-called \"Flint Knives,\" suggesting that the Reindeer continued to inhabit Britain after the appearance of humans. The exploration also led to the discovery of various deposits, including stalagmite, cave-earth, and a basement of pebbles derived from the Brixham district.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
