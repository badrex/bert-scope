This new derivative retains some of the original compound's pharmacological activity, which could be useful for studying the structure-activity relationship of the toxin and potentially developing new drugs or research tools for studying sodium channels in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
