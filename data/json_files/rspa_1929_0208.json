The authors compare two methods for determining electrophoretic velocities and discuss the effects of pH, buffer solutions, and electrolytes on the behavior of gold sols and proteins. The study provides insights into the separation and analysis of proteins and gold sols, with potential applications in diagnosing cerebrospinal fluid and serum.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloids and Surface Chemistry"}
