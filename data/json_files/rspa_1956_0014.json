They provide equations for a single loading followed by one unloading and focus on materials with a linear stress-logarithmic strain curve for unloading in simple extension. They discuss two special cases of the constitutive equations for loading, one of which is a generalization of Prager's suggestion, and apply these equations to various specific problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
