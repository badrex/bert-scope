He observes that the violent contractions in tetanus cause ecchymosis and changes in the microscopic structure of muscle fibers. This study provides insights into the nature of muscle contraction and the impact of tetanus on muscle tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurology"}
