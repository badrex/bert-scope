He found that heat increases the conductivity of metals and rarefied gases. Ritchie also observed that the electric spark could pass through extremely thin glass and that the electric charge in a jar was affected by the density of the air inside. He concluded that there is a similarity between electric and magnetic influences.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
