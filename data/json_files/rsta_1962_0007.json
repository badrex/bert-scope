The study considers the wave equation derived in a previous paper and develops a simplified method to find approximations for difficult Fourier integrals. The results show that the form of the waves is determined by the value of q, and when q is large enough, the waves are contained in a wedge, resembling ship waves. The paper discusses the variation of wave amplitude as various parameters are changed.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
