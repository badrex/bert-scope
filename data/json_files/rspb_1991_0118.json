It highlights the challenges in measuring selection on traits and the importance of understanding the balance between conflicting fitness advantages. The authors suggest that studies of selection in wild populations can complement traditional approaches to the study of life history evolution, helping to identify trade-offs between life history traits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
