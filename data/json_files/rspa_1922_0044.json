They discovered that the atmosphere contains small amounts of two heavier constituents, likely molecules of krypton and xenon. The lighter constituent is more abundant, but both are only a small fraction of the amount of xenon. The author also observed a line indicating a substance with an atomic weight of about 118, possibly a compound of krypton.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
