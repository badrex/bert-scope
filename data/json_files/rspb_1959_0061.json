Ram spermatozoa oxidize sorbitol to fructose and can also reduce fructose and glucose to sorbitol. The enzyme sorbitol dehydrogenase, responsible for the reversible oxidoreduction of sorbitol to fructose in spermatozoa, was prepared and studied. This research contributes to understanding the energy metabolism of spermatozoa and the role of sorbitol in seminal plasma.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Physiology and Biochemistry"}
