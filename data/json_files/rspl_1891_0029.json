The authors observe the accumulation of glycogen and iron-containing pigments in liver cells, as well as alterations in the size of the meshes and distribution of the mitoma. These findings contribute to understanding the liver's role in digestion and the effects of various stimulating agents on liver cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
