They demonstrate the theorems' applications and connections to other mathematical concepts, such as the Phragmen-Lindel\u00f6f theorem and Poisson's integral. The results contribute to the understanding of the behavior of analytic functions and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analysis"}
