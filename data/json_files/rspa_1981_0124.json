It presents new experimental results that show the corner boundary layer is unstable in laminar form at Reynolds numbers higher than about 102 * 4. The findings help explain the differences between various experimental and theoretical results in the field and provide a guide for current theories on the subject.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
