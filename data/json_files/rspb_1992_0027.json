They suggest that binary sexes have evolved multiple times in association with fusion, and that species with more than two sexes may have uniparental inheritance of cytoplasmic genes. This new definition of sexes, based on the control of cytoplasmic gene inheritance, helps explain the variety of mating systems observed in nature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
