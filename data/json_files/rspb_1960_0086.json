The substances cause a decrease in bile flow and the excretion of bilirubin, phylloerythrin, coproporphyrin, alkaline phosphatase, and bromsulphalein. The researchers suggest that the mechanism behind this inhibition might be related to a general effect on liver cell permeability rather than interference with specific enzyme systems."}
