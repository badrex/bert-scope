Pulse and pulse-chase experiments were used to track the movement of photosynthetically fixed 14C from the alga to the animal tissue. The results show that the green hydra has a higher glycogen-to-protein ratio than aposymbionts, and starvation causes an immediate utilization of glycogen in both forms. The degree of transport is determined primarily by the amount of surplus photosynthate available to algal symbionts rather than the animal's capacity to regulate algal release.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
