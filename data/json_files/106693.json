He develops methods to calculate the force resulting from multiple forces acting on a point and applies these methods to problems involving lines, surfaces, and solids. This work contributes to the understanding of attraction laws and the mathematical foundations of mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Mathematical Physics"}
