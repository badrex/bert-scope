He studied silicated fluoric acid gas, subsilicated fluoric acid, and their combinations with ammonia. He also discovered fluoboracic acid and its compounds with ammonia. The experiments provided insights into the properties and reactions of these compounds, including their densities, solubility in water, and interactions with other substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
