They found that the reaction is important in forming a link in the nuclear carbon cycle, which is an energy source in matter at high temperatures, such as in stars. The results provide data for extrapolation to stellar conditions and contribute to the understanding of thermonuclear reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
