The author analyzes the semi-major axis, eccentricity, and inclination of satellite orbits in relation to these perturbations and derives criteria for the existence of these resonances. The article also provides tables of the predominant resonant terms for different types of lunisolar commensurabilities.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
