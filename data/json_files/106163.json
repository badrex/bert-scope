He found that the excitation of the glass is increased by using non-conducting substances in front and conducting materials behind the cylinder. He also discovered that the amalgam should only be applied to the posterior part of the cushion to facilitate the excitation. This improvement allows the machine to work effectively in any weather conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
