It discusses the common domains found in glycolytic enzymes, such as the NAD-binding domain in dehydrogenases, and how these domains may have evolved from simpler structures. The article also highlights the importance of understanding enzyme evolution in the context of other essential metabolic processes in early biological developments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
