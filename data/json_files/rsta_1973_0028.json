The researchers used two methods to estimate viscosity: flow rate measurements and a ballistic method with a steel spear. They found that the flow behavior and viscosity can vary significantly from lava to lava, depending on factors like temperature, composition, crystal and bubble content, and cooling history. The study provides valuable insights into the understanding of volcanic processes and the behavior of lava flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Volcanology"}
