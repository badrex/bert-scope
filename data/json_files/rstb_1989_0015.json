The authors discuss the use of metabolite analysis and various fractionation procedures to understand the regulation of photosynthesis and its interaction with the Calvin cycle. They also examine the role of electron transport and the assimilatory force in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
