They study sixteen specimens from the Frankfort Formation near Rome, New York State, and provide a new reconstruction of the trilobite based on the preserved appendages. The trilobite is believed to have been a benthic animal that walked on the substrate, fed on small organic fragments, and could have caught and squeezed small prey using its formidable array of posterior endites and spines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
