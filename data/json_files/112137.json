The author, J. Park Harrison, confirms the phenomenon of maximum and minimum temperatures occurring at specific phases of the moon. The results suggest a connection between lunar phases, cloud formation, and atmospheric temperature, with potential implications for meteorology and climate change.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
