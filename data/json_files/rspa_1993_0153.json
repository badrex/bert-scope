They introduce a specialized version of the formalism and explain the concept of exact sets of spinor fields. The formalism is applied to the spin-2 equation for the Weyl spinor in vacuum general relativity, providing a method to compute higher terms in the Taylor series expansion of the Weyl spinor."}
