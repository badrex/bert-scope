Angus Smith, investigates the absorption of gases by charcoal and discovers that charcoal absorbs gases in definite volumes, with oxygen absorbed being eight times more by volume than hydrogen. This finding suggests the possibility of a new series of chemical equivalents or molecules, which could be a bridge between physical and chemical phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
