They observed the craniofacial skeleton's formation, including the notochord, cartilaginous plates, auditory capsules, and other components. The research provides insights into the pig skull's development and can be applied to understanding mammalian skull development in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Development"}
