The expedition faced challenges due to polar ice and difficult terrain, but managed to complete a significant portion of the survey. The author believes that with further effort, the entire arc can be measured, providing valuable information about the Earth's shape and contributing to global compression knowledge.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
