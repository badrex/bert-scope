The test uses a chromate solution to match the hue of white light and determine the ratio of red to green sensations. This method allows for accurate and delicate quantification of color sensation deviations, providing valuable insights into color blindness and the trichromatic theory of color vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Sensory Perception"}
