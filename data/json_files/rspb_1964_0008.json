They discovered two types of swimming: synchronized forward swimming and asynchronous zig-zag swimming. The colony's locomotion is highly organized and coordinated, with nectophores undergoing sensory transformations during their life to serve different functions in swimming.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
