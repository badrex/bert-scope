They found that complete obstruction led to dropsy, while partial obstruction could result in survival with established anastomoses. The study challenges Starling's theory of hydrsemic plethora and provides insights into the underlying principles of both local and general venous obstruction.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiovascular System"}
