It examines the factors that determine the form and structure of leaves, buds, and scales, and concludes that some classical views on the organization of the leafy shoot are not compatible with the available data. The study also explores the role of extrinsic and intrinsic factors in morphological development and suggests that the shoot type of organization in vascular plants may be the result of parallel evolution."}
