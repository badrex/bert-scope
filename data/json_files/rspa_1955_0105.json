The authors measured the absolute differential cross-section for scattering at various angles and energies, finding a characteristic minimum at 90 degrees. They also discussed the experimental setup, including the neutron source, the liquid hydrogen target, the scintillation counter, and the electronic apparatus. The results provide valuable data for understanding nuclear interactions and improving nuclear physics models.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
