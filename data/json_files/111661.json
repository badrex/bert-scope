Clerk Maxwell, investigates the theory of compound colours and the relations of the colours of the spectrum. He proposes a new geometrical representation of colours using a triangular model, with three primary colours forming the angles of the triangle. This theory is based on the idea that all other colours are mixtures of these primary colours. Maxwell also discusses the experiments he conducted to determine the exact relations of the colours of the spectrum and how they fit into this triangular model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
