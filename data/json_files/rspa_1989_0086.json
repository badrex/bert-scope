They show that in the limit of vanishing Kerr length-parameter, Chandrasekhar's separation constant is equal to the total angular momentum. This result is derived from a comparison of the form of the simultaneous partial differential equation obeyed by Chandrasekhar's angular functions and the differential equations obeyed by the corresponding pair of angular functions in flat space.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity and Gravitation"}
