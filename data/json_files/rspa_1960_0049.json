The author explores the role of spin-orbit coupling, heavy-atom effects, and oxygen perturbation in enhancing these transitions. The study provides insights into the behavior of organic molecules in different environments and has implications for understanding phosphorescence and absorption spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
