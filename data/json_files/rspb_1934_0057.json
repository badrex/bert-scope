They propose a new ratio method that uses added particles to calculate bacterial numbers, avoiding the need to estimate the mass of soil in the film. This method provides a more accurate and reliable estimation of bacterial content in soil samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
