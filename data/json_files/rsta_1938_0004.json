The authors provide tables of these functions and discuss their applications in various fields, including solid-state physics, astrophysics, and the study of metals. They also compare Fermi-Dirac functions to Maxwell-Boltzmann statistics and demonstrate how the two are related.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical mechanics"}
