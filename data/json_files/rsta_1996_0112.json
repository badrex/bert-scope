These lasers are based on resonant tunnelling and can be tailored to emit light over a wide range of wavelengths using the same heterostructure material. High-power room temperature operation has been achieved at wavelengths of 5 and 8.5 \u00b5m, making them suitable for applications like environmental sensing and pollution monitoring.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
