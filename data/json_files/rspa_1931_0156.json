The authors used an expansion chamber to photograph the tracks formed by the particles and measured their ranges. They found that the energy distribution curve was made up of nuclear electrons with a continuous distribution of energy and secondary particles forming groups of homogeneous energy. The results provide insight into the behavior of particles emitted during radioactive decay.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
