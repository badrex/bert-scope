The authors develop a thermodynamic model to predict multicomponent exchange equilibria and test it experimentally. The study provides insights into the non-ideality in the zeolite phase and its effects on ion selectivity and exchange equilibria.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
