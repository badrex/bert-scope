He observes the similarities in the western shores of Ireland, Scotland, and Norway and discusses the Atlantic flood-tide wave's impact on these regions. Murray also explores the formation of sandbanks, shoals, and islands due to the tide's influence and suggests that the Dogger Bank's peculiar shape is a result of cotidal waves meeting.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Coastal Geology"}
