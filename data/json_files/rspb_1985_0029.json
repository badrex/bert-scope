The fish's elongated body, swimming behavior, and lack of specialized visual system suggest that they use the lateral line system for nocturnal plankton feeding. The research also describes the fish's dentition, digestive tract, body musculature, and locomotion, as well as the cranial canals that form an integral part of the fish's skull and lower jaw.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
