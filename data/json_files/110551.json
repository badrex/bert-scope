The author, John Augustus Lloyd, collected nearly 50,000 observations taken four times a day, recording data on barometer, thermometer, hygrometer, rain gauge, and atmospheric conditions. These observations were communicated by Captain Beaufort and are a valuable resource for understanding the climate and weather patterns of the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
