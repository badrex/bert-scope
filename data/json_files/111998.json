The author, Balfour Stewart, analyzes the changes in atmospheric pressure, temperature, and air electricity during these events using barographs and electrometers at Kew and Oxford. The results show a rapid rise in barometric pressure and an increase in wind velocity during both squalls, with the air at Kew remaining negatively electrified throughout.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
