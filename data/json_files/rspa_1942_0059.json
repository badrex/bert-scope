The author incorporates a boundary layer at the water's bottom and considers energy dissipation. The study predicts the minimum wind velocity needed to create waves and the resulting wave lengths, showing good agreement with observations for depths of several centimeters.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
