The authors propose a constant force model that predicts a transient stress distribution with depth, overcoming the limitations of the constant strain-rate model. They also explore how the geothermal gradient, crustal composition, and thickness affect the lithosphere's stress-depth relationship and how changes in tectonic force over time can lead to reversals in stress with depth.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Tectonics"}
