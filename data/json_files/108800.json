They analyzed various samples of narcotine and found that it has a consistent chemical composition, contradicting previous claims of multiple varieties. They also studied the decomposition of narcotine into opianic acid and cotarnine and proposed a method for its transformation. The authors concluded that the formula C22H23NO7 is more accurate for representing narcotine's composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
