They found a mean free path for nuclear interaction of 7023 cm and calculated mean cross-sections for star production in light and heavy nuclei. The results are consistent with the assumption of a probability for meson production of approximately 0.1 per star. The study contributes to understanding the behavior of high-energy protons and the interaction cross-sections in various nuclei.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
