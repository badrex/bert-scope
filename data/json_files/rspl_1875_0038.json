They discovered that the mechanical action of radiation is a function of both luminous rays and dark heat-rays. The author also developed a sensitive balance to weigh the force of radiation from a candle and examined the action of radiation on various materials like alum, rock-salt, and glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
