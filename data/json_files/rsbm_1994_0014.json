Born in Liverpool to immigrant parents, Lipson overcame challenging circumstances to pursue a successful career in physics. He studied at Liverpool University, where he worked on crystal structures using X-ray diffraction under the guidance of Arnold Beevers. Lipson and Beevers faced numerous challenges, including the lack of proper equipment and limited resources, but their determination led to significant breakthroughs in crystallography. Their work at Manchester University, under the guidance of Lawrence Bragg, resulted in the successful solution of several crystal structures, including beryllium sulphate tetrahydrate and nickel sulphate hexahydrate. Lipson's achievements in physics education and research left a lasting impact on the field of crystallography.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
