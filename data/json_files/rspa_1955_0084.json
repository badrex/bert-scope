They develop a theory that generalizes the classical theory for an oscillating aerofoil in an infinite stream and provides corrections for open-jet wind tunnel measurements. The results are expressed in terms of a generalized Theodorsen function, which has applications in improving wind tunnel tests for oscillating aerofoils.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
