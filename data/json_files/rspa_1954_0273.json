The unit cell is triclinic, and the molecules are nearly planar in configuration. The high melting point of polyethylene terephthalate is attributed to the rigidity of the aromatic ring with its attached C groups. The material's suitability for textile fibers is discussed, and the search for evidence of strong intermolecular forces is mentioned.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
