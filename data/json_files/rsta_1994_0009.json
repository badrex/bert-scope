It discusses the various reactions and cross-sections involved in neutrino detection and the expected neutrino spectra from a type II supernova explosion. The article also presents the observations of neutrinos from the supernova in different detectors and the conclusions drawn from these observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
