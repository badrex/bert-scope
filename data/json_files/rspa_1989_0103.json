They find that this model predicts substantial absorption at frequencies between the microwave and far-infrared bands, an increase in the frequency of maximum microwave absorption, a decrease in the frequency of maximum far-infrared absorption, and a more rapid fall-off of far-infrared absorption. The theoretical results are in qualitative agreement with experimental observations on methyl chloride.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
