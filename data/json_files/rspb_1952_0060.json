The research found that the rate of substrate oxidation decreases significantly at oxygen tensions below 20%, indicating that these enzymes have low oxygen affinity. Additionally, the study discovered that the substrate concentration required for half-maximal oxidation rates decreases with a lowering of oxygen tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
