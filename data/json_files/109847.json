They found that the size of the wire and the aperture in the metallic gauze affected the safety of the lamp. The author also proposed that oxygen exists in the center of all flames, forming an explosive mixture with the vapor, but only burns at the exterior surface. Lamps with these safety measures have been successfully tested in mines near Newcastle.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
