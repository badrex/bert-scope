The solutions provide a more accurate understanding of the reconnection process and its implications for astrophysical and space plasmas. The research puts Petschek's mechanism on a solid mathematical foundation and shows that the discontinuities are not straight but curve away from the incoming flows. The maximum reconnection rate depends weakly on the magnetic Reynolds number and decreases as the inflow Alfven Mach number increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
