They investigated the flow of steam through an orifice and the impact of pressure and temperature on the steam's properties. The research aimed to understand the conditions under which adiabatic flow occurs and the implications for wiredrawing experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
