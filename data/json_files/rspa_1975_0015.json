The theory involves an exact decomposition of the Dirac sources into polarization sources, which couple directly to the field intensities, providing a clear separation between electric and magnetic interactions. This approach avoids the complications of conventional quantum electrodynamics and offers potential applications to various atomic and molecular systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
