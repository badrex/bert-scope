The experiments involved comparing the time of two clocks, one in New York and one in Cambridge, by sending signals through the telegraph. The results showed that the difference in longitude could be determined with a high level of precision, paving the way for more accurate timekeeping and navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Telecommunications"}
