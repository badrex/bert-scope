They found that chloroform has a direct impact on the heart's intrinsic rhythm and that the reduction in pulse rate during chloroform anesthesia is partly due to the action of chloroform on the heart itself and partly due to the controlling influence of the vagus center in the medulla.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
