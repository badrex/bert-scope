They found that the laws regulating the effects of stimuli on voluntary and involuntary muscles are different. Mechanical and chemical stimuli applied to the nervous system affect the heart's action, but not voluntary muscles unless near the spinal marrow. The author also discovered that the heart's motions are more regular than those of voluntary muscles and that their power can be destroyed through the nervous system."}
