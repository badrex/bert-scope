They find that after an average of 3 to 8 main-chain fractures per molecule, all trace of the initial distribution curve is lost. The shape of the curve of weight average against degree of degradation can provide information about the initial weight average and molecular weights, allowing for the characterization of the initial molecular-weight distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
