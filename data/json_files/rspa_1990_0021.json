The authors develop a formally exact solution for the system and evaluate it in the asymptotic limits of heavy fluid loading. They find that the scattered sound field consists of a finite number of plane waves propagating in distinct directions, with the pressure in fluid 1 being the sum of the incident plane wave, a plane wave reflected as if the upper plate were rigid, and a term due to the periodic array of connectors.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Acoustics"}
