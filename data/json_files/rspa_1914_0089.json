They determined the convection constants of the wires and found that the heat-loss is proportional to the temperature difference between the wire and the surrounding air. This research has implications for the development of hot-wire anemometers and the measurement of thermal conductivity in gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
