The authors determine the Hamaker coefficients and find that they approach a constant value as the film thickness increases, but tend to rise rapidly towards smaller thicknesses. They also examine the role of lipid polar groups, hydrocarbon layer structure, and dielectric permeability in determining the Hamaker coefficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
