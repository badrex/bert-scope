They found that the expansion pressures of metallic hydrogen and deuterium differ by 7-8%, and that deuterium is less ionized than hydrogen. The experiments also showed hysteresis effects in the electrical resistance of gas-charged palladium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
