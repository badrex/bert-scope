This practice was widespread and considered a way to build immunity against the potentially fatal illness. The author provides several accounts of people who had successfully acquired the smallpox through this method, but also mentions a tragic case where a young woman died after receiving the matter from a person with a severe case of smallpox.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Infectious Diseases"}
