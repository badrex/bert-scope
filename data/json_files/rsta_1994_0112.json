The author argues that AI should focus on the study of sophisticated self-modifying information-driven control systems, both natural and artificial, and that design-based theories can help refine complex and ambiguous concepts like'mind', 'consciousness', 'information', and 'understander'. By exploring design space and the associated requirements, AI can contribute to a better understanding of human and animal intelligence, as well as improve education, therapy, and counseling.", "scientific_discipline": "Cognitive Science > Artificial Intelligence"}
