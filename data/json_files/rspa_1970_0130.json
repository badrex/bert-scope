They introduce a similarity transformation of the Schr\u00f6dinger equation that addresses the cusp conditions at both nuclei and maintains the correct molecular symmetry. The first-order theory is examined in detail and compared with other united atom theories, showing remarkable agreement for separations up to 1 bohr.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
