The author demonstrates that hoariness is determined by two factors, H and K, while sap-color is determined by two factors, C and R. The author also explains the complex interrelation between these factors, which affects the appearance of hoariness in different strains of stocks. The findings contribute to a better understanding of plant genetics and breeding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
