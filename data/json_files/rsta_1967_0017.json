They describe the theoretical advantages of using barium oxide in argon suspensions and present experimental results showing that these suspensions have conductivities within an order of magnitude of the theoretical values. The authors also discuss the challenges in creating uniform suspensions of submicron particles and the potential for further improvements in conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy Conversion"}
