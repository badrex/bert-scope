The research focuses on the arrangement and function of the striated muscles and their innervation, providing detailed descriptions of the external morphology and internal structures of the tail. The findings contribute to the understanding of the movement patterns and mechanics of these parasites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
