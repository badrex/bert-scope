They found that increasing the initial pressure significantly increased the tendency to detonate, but the limit was reached at about 3 atmospheres. The authors also observed the effects of temperature on detonation and the influence of \"antiknocks\" on detonation at high pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Explosion"}
