They conducted experiments using raw spaghetti and compared their results with other studies, confirming that the volume fraction tends to zero as slenderness increases. This research has implications for material reinforcement, liquid crystal arrays, and surface chemistries involving rod-like molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fiber packing"}
