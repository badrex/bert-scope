They conducted experiments using stored soils from the Rothamsted Experimental Station and found that protozoa, specifically amoebae and flagellates, limit bacterial activity in the soil. The author also tested the effects of different protozoa species on bacterial counts and found that they have varying abilities to limit bacterial activity. This research contributes to our understanding of soil ecology and the role of microorganisms in maintaining soil health.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Microbiology"}
