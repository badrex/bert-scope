They found that the scattering was not symmetrical, with more energy scattered in the forward direction and less in the backward direction. The atomic scattering coefficient also varied for different elements and rays, indicating that the Electron Ring Theory needed further refinement to account for these observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
