The author, William Snow Harris, demonstrates that every substance susceptible of magnetism by induction tends to arrest the action of a magnet upon a third substance. He also explores the neutralizing power of iron and suggests that substances highly susceptible of receiving transient magnetism are the most efficient in their operation as screens.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
