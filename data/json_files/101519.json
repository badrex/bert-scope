These worms were found to create cavities in the stone by consuming it and leaving behind their excrement and shells. The author also observed that these worms had a unique appearance and behavior, including multiple eyes, jaw-like structures, and the ability to move and form their shells. The worms were also found to be present in mortar, and it was suggested that they might be responsible for the holes found in stone surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
