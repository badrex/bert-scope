This definition aims to be simple, widely applicable, and satisfy the qualitative connotations of electronegativity. The author compares this new definition with previous definitions by Mulliken and Pauling, and discusses its applications and potential difficulties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electronegativity and Bonding"}
