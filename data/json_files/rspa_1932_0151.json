The authors study the current-voltage-temperature relationship and propose that the current is mainly electronic, with some electrolytic current at lower temperatures. They also discuss the process of forming and poisoning the coatings, suggesting that free barium is present in the active state of the coating, contributing to its conductivity and thermionic emission.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
