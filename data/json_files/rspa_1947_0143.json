The authors tabulate the functions for values of the adiabatic index between 1 and 15, and demonstrate their application in solving a physical problem involving gas flow from a slit in an infinite plane wall. The results are useful for understanding and designing channels and other structures in high-speed fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
