The authors argue that a more realistic theory of thermal convection is likely confined to the outer mantle and is an unstable flow, which could explain the pattern of ocean ridges and orogenic belts. They also explore the possible driving forces behind these motions, such as chemical or physical inhomogeneities, and the role of crustal fractionation in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
