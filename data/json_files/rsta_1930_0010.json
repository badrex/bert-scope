They conclude that the Earth's magnetic field is mostly generated within its core, which has a high conductivity. The study of these variations can provide valuable information about the Earth's interior, although more research is needed to understand the exact properties of the core.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
