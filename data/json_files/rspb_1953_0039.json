It demonstrates the presence of an enzyme system with both mono- and polyphenolase activity, which is affected by factors that also influence pigment production. The study also identifies the coelomic fluid's role in the metabolic activities of echinoderms and the site of pigment origin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinoderm Biology"}
