They found that mevalonate, a sterol, suppresses the reductase's activity, suggesting that it may act as a repressor derived from mevalonate metabolism. This discovery provides insights into the regulation of cholesterol synthesis in cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
