These structures consist of alternate layers of high and low refractive index material, with the high refractive index material in the form of discrete plates. The research investigates whether these structures approximate the ideal JA0 stacks for interference reflectors and explores the optical properties and thicknesses of the plates in various fish and cephalopod species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
