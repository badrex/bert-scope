Monthly maps of the gas-transfer coefficient are derived, revealing seasonal changes and a strong meridional pattern with larger exchange coefficients at high latitudes. The study also assesses the accuracy and representativity of these maps by comparing them with other estimates and validating them through various tests.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
