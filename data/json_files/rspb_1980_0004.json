This prolonged potential appears to be due to the summation of quantal events. The study also shows that voltage fluctuations superimposed on the sustained potential are likely caused by chloride ions, while the sustained potential is mainly due to potassium ions. The authors conclude that transmitter is released in package form, producing miniature synaptic potentials.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
