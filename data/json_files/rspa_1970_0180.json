They investigate geodesics in the energy subspace and find that they coincide with classical trajectories when the energy is conserved. The Riemannian metric allows for a separation of the geodesic into a geodesic in phase space and a geodesic on the unit sphere, providing insights into the behavior of dynamical systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
