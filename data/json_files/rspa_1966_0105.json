They found that the dipole moment of a water molecule in ice is greater than that of an isolated molecule due to the electric fields of neighboring molecules. This research helps to understand the interactions of water molecules in ice and the effects of these interactions on the dipole moment of water molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
