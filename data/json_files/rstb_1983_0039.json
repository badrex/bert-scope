The researchers found that when the light chains are not phosphorylated, myosin filaments disassemble into smaller structures. Phosphorylation of the light chains causes these structures to unfold and assemble into filaments, which play a crucial role in muscle contraction and other motile activities. This process is regulated by the intracellular calcium ion concentration."}
