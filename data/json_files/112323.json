He discusses the secular change and annual variation of the declination and the annual variation or semiannual inequality of the inclination and horizontal and total magnetic force. The study reveals the existence of a variation in the declination with an annual period, consisting of a semiannual inequality with epochs coinciding with the sun's passage of the equator. The author also compares the results with observations at Hobarton, St. Helena, and the Cape of Good Hope.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
