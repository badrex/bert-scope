The research provides two-dimensional lattice fringe images of the parent-martensite interface and reveals the existence of atomic-scale steps in the internal martensite twin interfaces. The findings suggest an explanation for the fine striated substructure of the martensite and contribute to the understanding of the fine-scale structure of interfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
