The researchers induced diabetes in cats using ox anterior pituitary extract or purified growth hormone and cured it using the anti-diabetic drug, tolbutamide. They examined the changes in the pancreatic islets during the diabetes and recovery process using biopsy samples. The findings reveal that the destruction of pancreatic islet cells in cats that did not recover from diabetes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
