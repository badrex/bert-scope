They evaluated the nuclear electric quadrupole moments of 63Cu and 65Cu, finding them to be (in units of 10^-24 cm^2): 63Cu, -0.016; 65Cu, -0.015, with an estimated maximum error in the theory of 20%. The results provide insights into the magnetic properties and interactions of copper ions in crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
