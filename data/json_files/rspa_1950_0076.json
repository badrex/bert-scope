They introduce a new classification system based on the transformation properties of states under the group of rotations in five-dimensional space. This classification helps predict the order of levels with short-range attractive forces and provides insights into nuclear isomerism and the filling of the d-shell.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
