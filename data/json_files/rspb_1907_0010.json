They discovered that some strains caused paralysis in rats, while others did not. The author found that trypanosomata were rarely found in the blood of paralyzed rats, and that the site of inoculation determined the location of paralysis. This research highlights the importance of studying the pathogenic action of trypanosomata for better understanding and differentiation between similar organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
