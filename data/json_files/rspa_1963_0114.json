The authors emphasize the importance of considering charge as the dependent variable in discussions of charged interfaces, rather than the potential difference. The new model takes into account various factors, such as the influence of oriented water dipoles, anionic adsorption, and the interaction between water and organic molecules, providing a more consistent interpretation of the interface's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
