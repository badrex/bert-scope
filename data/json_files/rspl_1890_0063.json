They compared the spectra of these stars with the blue band of a hydrocarbon flame and found that the bands in the stars did not match the carbon band in the flame. This discovery challenged previous assumptions about the presence of carbon in these stars and led to further investigation into their composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
