He encourages others with more advanced optical equipment to search for these lines and provides guidance on how to do so. The author also briefly touches on the concept of the \"facility of production\" of chemical substances and its relation to mathematical laws of combination.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
