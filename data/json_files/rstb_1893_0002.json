They found that each nerve root sends fibers to multiple nerves and muscles, and that the order of derivation from above down is constant. The sensory nerves also follow specific rules in their distribution. This research helped to better understand the complex relationships between nerve roots, nerves, and muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
