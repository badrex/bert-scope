They found that the number of alpha particles emitted per second per gram of radium is 8,000, which can be directly compared with previous measurements. This study demonstrates the potential of the valve counter in the investigation of artificial element disintegration and other radioactive work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
