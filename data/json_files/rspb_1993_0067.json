They found that the naturally occurring L and M cone peaks may be set at a pair of points on the spectrum that, on average, minimizes the red-green chromatic signal. This observation supports the idea that red-green vision has evolved for a specific task, such as finding fruit, while minimizing interference by the chromatic signal in luminance vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Color Perception"}
