They analyzed the temperature factors and compared their results with theoretical predictions. The study found that the observed and calculated results agreed up to about 50 Abs., with the temperature factors affecting the intensity of X-ray reflexion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
