They discovered that there is a property of the blood fluids, independent of the opsonic power, which acts directly on microorganisms or red blood cells, rendering them more easily digested by leucocytic ferments. This property is called the \"protryptic\" property of the serum. The experiments show that only unheated serum can promote intra-leucocytic digestion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
