They found that the oxidative enzyme systems, such as succinate-cytochrome c reductase, DPNH oxidase, and cytochrome c oxidase, significantly decrease during the first 24 hours of pupation and remain low throughout diapause. The enzyme activities and cytochrome concentrations increase again when diapause is terminated and the insect develops into an adult moth. This research provides insights into the relationship between the cytochrome system and the prothoracic gland hormone in insect development.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
