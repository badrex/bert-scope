The paper explores the concept of heredity as a simplified phenomenon and its connection to the division and repetition of parts in living organisms. The author raises concerns about the validity of Pearson's observations and the significance of the average homotyposis of \"undifferentiated like parts\" in understanding heredity and variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Genetics"}
