Halley discusses the use of cross hairs in telescopes for observing celestial objects and improving the accuracy of their positions. He demonstrates the effectiveness of this method by observing the positions of stars relative to Venus and Mercury, and concludes that this technique can be used to determine the distance between the Sun and Earth with greater precision.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
