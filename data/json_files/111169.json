He uses dichroitic crystals, such as tourmaline, sapphire, and idocrase, to show that the vibrations are not in the plane of polarization, as some other mathematicians have claimed. This discovery helps to understand the nature of polarized light and its applications in crystal optics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
