They designed a simple instrument to accurately measure the lateral displacements in the beam's section and used it to determine the amount and distribution of strain in iron beams. The results showed that as the load increased, the increment of lateral strain in the outer tensile layers became less, while the increment in the less-stressed fibers near the neutral surface increased. The findings also revealed that the values of the strains obtained were significantly lower than expected from theoretical considerations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
