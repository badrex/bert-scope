They found that the resistance to gas transport depends on the surface's geometry and wind speed, and that the eddy diffusivities of heat and gas in the boundary layer are nearly equal. This research provides insights into the complex processes of gas transport over natural surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Surface Processes and Meteorology"}
