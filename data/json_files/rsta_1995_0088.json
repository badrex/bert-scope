The authors study the MLC circuit and the first-order circuit with a 'jump-rule,' showing that these circuits can exhibit a rich variety of bifurcation and chaos phenomena through experimental results, numerical simulations, and analytical discussions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electronics and Circuits"}
