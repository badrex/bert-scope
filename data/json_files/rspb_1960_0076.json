It highlights the importance of understanding the interplay between climate, biotic zones, and ocean currents in shaping the life and migration patterns of these birds. The article also emphasizes the need for further research on taxonomic studies, ecological niches, and interspecific competition to better understand oceanic avifauna.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Ornithology"}
