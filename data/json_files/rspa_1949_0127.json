They used a Fabry-Perot interferometer to examine the Doppler widths of CH bands emitted from the reaction zone of an oxy-acetylene flame. The results showed that the effective translational temperatures of excited CH radicals in low-pressure flames were lower than the theoretical maximum flame temperatures, while the effective rotational temperatures did not differ much from the theoretical maximum flame temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
