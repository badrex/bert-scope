This apparatus can be used for various color-changing reactions, even with small quantities of material, and is suitable for studying biological substances. The author demonstrated its effectiveness in measuring reactions with half-reaction times greater than 0.0005 seconds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Analysis"}
