The authors used the hook and absorption methods to determine these strengths for strong and weak lines, respectively. The results provide a consistent set of oscillator strengths that can be used to check stellar atmosphere models and adjust model parameters for consistency.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
