He discovered that nerves accompany the hepatic artery and its branches, forming ganglia and plexuses. These nerves also surround the hepatic and cystic ducts and the gallbladder. Lee found that these nerves originate from the semilunar ganglion and solar plexus, providing a better understanding of the liver's nerve supply and its connections to the digestive system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
