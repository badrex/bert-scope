They used an electromagnet and a special apparatus to test the magnetic properties of blood samples. The results showed that arterial blood, rich in oxygen, exhibited paramagnetic properties, while venous blood, containing more carbon dioxide, displayed diamagnetic properties. This research helped to understand the differences in blood properties and their relation to oxygenation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Blood and Circulation"}
