Theoretical models predict that males with a higher risk of sperm competition, like parr, should invest more in spermatogenesis to achieve fertilization success. The research finds that parr invest relatively more heavily in total spermatogenesis, producing greater numbers of sperm and having a larger gonosomatic index than anadromous males. These findings may explain how male parr, under elevated risks of sperm competition, achieve disproportionately high fertilization success.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
