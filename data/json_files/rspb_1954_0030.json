They found that the sodium fluxes were of the order of 10, and the potassium fluxes were nearly doubled in 5 mm-K. The results suggest that there may be a form of coupling between sodium efflux and potassium influx in frog muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
