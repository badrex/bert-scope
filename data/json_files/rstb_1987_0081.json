It explores scaffold-associated regions (SARs) and their role in the structure and function of chromatin loops. The study finds that specific SARs are present near regulated genes and that topoisomerase II, a major component of the scaffold, plays a crucial role in chromosome organization and gene expression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
