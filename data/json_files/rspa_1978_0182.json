The authors describe experimental results and related theory, focusing on the specific case of ion cyclotron modes. They demonstrate a method of exciting these modes without also exciting ion acoustic modes, allowing for the identification of the decay product waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
