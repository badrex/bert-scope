It explores two main types of self-incompatibility systems: gametophytic and sporophytic, and examines how they function at the cellular level. The article also highlights the importance of cell surface interactions and communication in these systems, and the role of large molecules in plant cell communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Plant Biology"}
