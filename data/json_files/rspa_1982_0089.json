They develop a general theory for the case when the magnetic field is in an arbitrary direction and discuss special cases, such as along the [111] axis and the spectrum of a concentrated compound with fast flip-flops between electronic states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
