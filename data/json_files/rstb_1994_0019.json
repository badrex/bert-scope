The CA3 region is modeled as a network of pyramidal neurons connected through their recurrent collaterals, with inhibitory interneurons regulating the membrane potentials. The theory considers the storage of memories, recall process, and the role of inhibitory interneurons in the hippocampal network.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
