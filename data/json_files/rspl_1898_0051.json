Travers discovered a new gas in the atmosphere, which they named \"krypton.\" This gas has a unique spectrum and is heavier than argon. They found that krypton is an element and has a density of around 22.5, making it a monatomic gas. The discovery expanded the understanding of the composition of Earth's atmosphere and added a new element to the periodic table.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Science"}
