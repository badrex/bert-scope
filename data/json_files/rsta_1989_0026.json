The study shows that ionospheric convection responds rapidly to changes in the interplanetary medium, emphasizing the potential of ground-based radars and other remote-sensing instruments for studying Earth's interaction with the interplanetary medium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetospheric Physics"}
