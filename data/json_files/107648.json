They observed the properties of these liquids, such as their refractive power, specific gravity, and pressure at different temperatures. The experiments also demonstrated the potential dangers of working with these substances, such as the powerful explosions that occurred when opening tubes containing carbonic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Chemistry"}
