The researchers found that parietal cells are responsible for the production of hydrochloric acid. The acid is produced in the upper part of the tubules and then transported to the lower part, where it is secreted into the lumen. Some of the acid may also be released on the surface of the cell, contributing to the overall acid production in the stomach.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Histology and Cell Biology"}
