The author demonstrates the validity of the formulae under certain conditions and extends the theory to partial differential equations. This work has significant implications for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems in mathematical physics and quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
