It forms four longitudinal bands and is related to myoepithelial cells that may adjust the tonus of the hydroskeleton. The secondary muscle has a distinct mode of cross-striation with two sarcomere types (si and s2) that alternate along the contractile apparatus. These sarcomeres have different functions and structures, and the muscle's contractile architecture is highly dynamic, allowing for strong modulation of muscular contraction. This muscle is peculiar to chaetognaths and does not assist in relating them to other phyla.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
