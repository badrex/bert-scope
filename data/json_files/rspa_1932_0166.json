They develop a theoretical explanation for the measured accommodation coefficients for helium on tungsten at various temperatures, considering the interaction between the gas atom and the solid surface. The authors use Bessel functions and quantum transitions to calculate the transition probabilities per collision and evaluate the accommodation coefficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
