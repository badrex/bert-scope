They apply the image-force model to the potential barrier and explain the mechanism of current flow over the barrier. The theory is applied to the selenium plate rectifier, predicting the onset of thermal instability with reasonable accuracy and explaining hysteresis and other phenomena observed during breakdown.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
