Glycerine was chosen for its low vapor tension and minimal expansion, allowing for more accurate readings. The barometer was successfully erected at Kew Observatory, and a series of observations were planned to assess its scientific and practical value.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
