They found that the spinal preparation can develop the slow cumulative progress of the tetanic contraction of the reflex, and that recruitment is a distinctive feature of certain reflex groups. The study contributes to the understanding of reflexes and their mechanisms in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
