They provide explicit forms for the rates of change of inclination and eccentricity at common resonances, using a standardized notation and evaluating two subsidiary functions. This analysis has led to the most accurate values available for lumped geopotential harmonics of relevant orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
