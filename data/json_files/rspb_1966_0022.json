{"article_id": "rspb_1966_0022", "revised_title": "Exploring the Mechanism of Genetic Transcription and RNA-DNA Complexes", "semantic_tags": ["'Genetic transcription'", "'RNA-DNA complex'", "'RNA polymerase'", "'DNA template'"], "tldr": "This article discusses the process of genetic transcription, focusing on the RNA-DNA complex and the role of RNA polymerase in synthesizing RNA from a DNA template. The author explores the molecular kinetics of RNA synthesis and the differences between in vitro and in vivo situations. The findings suggest that the in vitro model system lacks an essential component, a process that actively removes the nascent RNA transcript from the RNA polymerase complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
