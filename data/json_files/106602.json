He resolves the \"milky way\" into countless stars and identifies over 400 new nebulae and star clusters, some of which were previously unknown. He also discusses the need to consider the heavens as a three-dimensional space with variously inclined and directed strata, rather than a flat, two-dimensional surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
