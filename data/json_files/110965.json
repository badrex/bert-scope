The substance, hydrated deutoxide of albumen, is soluble in water and precipitated by nitric acid. This finding suggests that the loss of this substance in urine is equivalent to the loss of blood. Additionally, a letter from William A. Norton discusses his mathematical investigation on a new theory of terrestrial magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Biochemistry"}
