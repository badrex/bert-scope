The author conducted experiments during a voyage from Barbados to England and found that carbonate of lime was present in sea-water near the coast but not in large quantities in the open ocean. The author also explored the implications of these findings for the formation of sandstone and the incrustation of steam vessel boilers.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
