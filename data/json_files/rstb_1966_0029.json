It examines two types of rituals: consensual rituals that bind together all members of the school and differentiating rituals that mark off groups within the school. These rituals help to create a unique identity for the school, define and regulate boundaries, and control ambivalence and dual allegiances. The article also explores how changes in society, such as industrialization and technological advancements, affect the significance of rituals in schools.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Sociology of Education"}
