These bounds are more restrictive than previous bounds, such as Hashin-Shtrikman's, McCoy's, and Beran-Molyneux's bounds, and can be useful for understanding the properties of heterogeneous materials with known volume fractions. The study focuses on thermal conductivity but can be extended to other properties with similar governing equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
