They focused on the study of collective modes, as described by the auto-correlation functions of the longitudinal and transverse components of the currents of mass and charge. The results showed that the memory function has a similar structure in all cases, with a short-lived initial decay and a long-lived quasi-exponential tail. This study provides insights into the dynamic events that contribute to the memory functions in liquids and their relation to neutron-scattering experiments."}
