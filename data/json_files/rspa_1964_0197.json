They found that the explosion produced ionization clouds extending over thousands of kilometers in altitude and that corpuscular radiation is a major source of ionization in the topside ionosphere. The ionosphere can recover from major disturbances within 24 hours, indicating a close coupling with the F2 region through inter-diffusion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Space Physics"}
