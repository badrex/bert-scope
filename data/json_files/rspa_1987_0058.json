They compare and analyze two models, the FitzHugh-Nagumo equation and a model second-order equation, and provide a full map of the solutions for the given equation. The study shows that limit cycles do not exist under the conditions arising from the physics of the nerve fiber, and the threshold problem is analyzed in detail.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
