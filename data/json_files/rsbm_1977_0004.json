He worked with Drosophila melanogaster and Drosophila pseudoobscura, using chromosome studies and population studies to understand evolution and adaptation in nature. Dobzhansky's work helped to clarify concepts such as dominance and recessiveness in genes and laid the foundation for future research in genetics and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
