He describes the unique dentition and cranial anatomy of the Placodus, comparing it to other extinct reptiles like Nothosaurus, Simosaurus, and Pistosaurus. Owen also discusses the microscopic structure of the teeth and their adaptation for crushing hard substances, as well as the relationship between the Placodus and the shellfish they consumed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
