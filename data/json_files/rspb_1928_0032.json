By measuring the heat produced by a succession of twitches, the author finds that the total heat is equal to the initial heat, indicating that the delayed anaerobic heat is practically non-existent in this case. This study helps to understand the fundamental unit of muscular activity and the chemical changes that occur during muscle contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
