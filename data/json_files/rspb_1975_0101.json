The research explores how the eye adapts to different light conditions, with the rhabdomeres moving closer to the cornea in the dark-adapted state and further away in the light-adapted state. The study also examines the visual axes of individual rhabdomeres and the interommatidial angles, providing insights into how the eye processes visual information.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
