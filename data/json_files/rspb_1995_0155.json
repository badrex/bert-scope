This caecilian has a unique combination of morphological features, such as sealed choanae, complete absence of pulmonary blood vessels, and a repatterned skull. The discovery of lunglessness in caecilians expands our understanding of the evolution of this amphibian group and their respiratory adaptations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Amphibia"}
