They used the model of independent pseudoatoms and the Kirkwood approximation to calculate the partition function for a random assembly and a liquid metal. The results show that the partition function for the liquid metal is quite close to that of the solid, and short-range order plays a significant role in determining electron states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
