This scheme allows for meaningful comparisons of elastodynamic properties and offers advantages such as cyclic interchange, concise expression of basic homogeneous plane wave theory, and rapid appreciation of essential configurations of homogeneous plane wave slowness. The article applies the scheme to the theory of bulk waves in three diverse media: uranium, spruce wood, and a hypothetical medium discussed by Al'shits and Lothe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
