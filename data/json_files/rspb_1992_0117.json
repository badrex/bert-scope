This method involves amplifying a specific segment of the mitochondrial DNA and using allele-specific oligonucleotide probes for dot-blot typing. This technique can help in colony management, recognizing individuals in comparative studies, and forensic investigations related to the origin of traded animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
