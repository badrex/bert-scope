He developed methods to determine the directions of movement of the earthquake wave at various points and found the seismic vertical, the line passing through the point vertically over the center of effort and the focal point's depth. Mallet also studied the effects of the earthquake on the region's buildings, geological structure, and physical features, providing valuable insights into the nature of earthquakes and their impact on the Earth's surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
