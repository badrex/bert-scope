The authors developed an apparatus to measure the specific heat of water and aqueous solutions with high accuracy. They found that the specific heat of water decreases with increasing temperature and that the mechanical equivalent of the calorie is consistent with previous measurements. The authors also identified a potential source of error in previous electrical determinations of the mechanical equivalent of heat, which they call a \"thermoid effect.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
