The authors analyze the field electron emission properties of nanotips and ferromagnetic nanotips, and explore their potential in improving the resolution and brightness of electron beams. They also describe the use of nanotips in a versatile low-energy electron projection microscope, the Fresnel projection microscope, for observations of nanometric fibers and organic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
