They discovered that substances like decoctions of wormwood, infusions of chamomile-flowers, and salt of hartshorn were effective in preserving animal substances from putrefaction. The author also found that different antiseptics were needed for different types of putrid diseases and that astringency played a significant role in their effectiveness. They also observed that heat, moisture, and stagnant air were the most common means of accelerating putrefaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Experiments"}
