They propose that this enamel formation is a result of centripetal calcification of fibers provided by the ameloblasts, which is a common process in all enamel development. This study provides insight into the formation of enamel in animals, including human enamel.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
