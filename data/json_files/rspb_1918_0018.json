They discover that fibrillation is a condition of \"fasciculation\" rather than \"fibrillation,\" and that it can be induced by depressing agencies or excessive rapidity of excitation. The study establishes the importance of depression of conductivity in the occurrence of fibrillar beats and the relationship between the rate of succession and the degree of dissociation in fibrillation."}
