They discovered that recrystallization occurs by the migration of original grain boundaries. A theory based on this mechanism can explain the known form of recrystallization kinetics without introducing anisotropy in grain boundary mobility. This research provides insights into the understanding of the recrystallization process in cold-worked metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
