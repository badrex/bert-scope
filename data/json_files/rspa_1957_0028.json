They also re-examine reaction between two different solids in the context of their physical and crystallographic properties, deducing the rate law for additive reactions from the quantum theory. The study concludes that crystallographic phase transformations and the formation of transitional structures constitute the phase-boundary processes, governed by the dynamics of diffusion processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
