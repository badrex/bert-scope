The most prominent feature of the spectrum is the OH bands sequence. A strong feature at 3.3 micrometers is likely due to methane emission, and further analysis of the interferograms will provide more information on the airglow's composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Infrared Astronomy"}
