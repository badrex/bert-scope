They discovered a new frictional effect, the 'wedging effect,' which is directly correlated with the orientation of the adsorbed lubricant film. This effect leads to a type of lubrication called 'quasi-hydrodynamic.' The investigation shows that long-chain polar compounds primarily act by inducing the 'wedging effect' and not by providing direct protection to the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
