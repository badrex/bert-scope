The author proposes a hypothesis that ions are molecular aggregates in combination with water, and their size depends on the amount of water combined. This hypothesis helps reconcile the law of mass action with conductivity data for strong and weak electrolytes, providing a more accurate representation of ionization coefficients and ionic volumes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
