The experiments show that carbon dioxide causes a decrease in heart output, while adrenaline increases coronary flow. When combined, carbon dioxide and adrenaline can lead to an increased total heart output. The findings suggest that the effects of these substances on the heart are related to their impact on venous pressures and diastolic filling.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
