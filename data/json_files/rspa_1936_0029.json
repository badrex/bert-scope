They calculate the probability of internal conversion of series radiation for gold and silver using Moszkowski's formula, taking into account relativistic effects and electron exchange. The study provides a test of Dirac's equations applied to atomic phenomena and contributes to the understanding of the Auger effect in heavy atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
