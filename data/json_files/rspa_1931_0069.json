They introduce the concept of serial correlation coefficients and discuss the use of Fourier analysis and periodograms to identify natural periods in the data. The author applies this method to analyze pressure data from Port Darwin, demonstrating the utility of the approach in understanding oscillations in world weather patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Time series analysis"}
