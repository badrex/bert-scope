The authors found that cancer occurs in various animals and that the clinical, pathological, anatomical, and microscopical characters of these new growths are similar to those found in humans. They also discovered a sequence of cell changes characteristic of carcinoma and sarcoma, which is the same as the one that initiates the origin of the sexual generation in plants and is terminal in the history of sexual cells in animals. The authors confirmed that cancer can be successfully transplanted from one animal to another of the same species, and they discussed the process of transplantation and its relation to metastasis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cancer Research"}
