The study focuses on the native phytochrome monomer with a molecular mass of 124, which is different from previous preparations containing a mixture of proteolytically degraded 118 and 114 polypeptides. The research explores the effects of proteolytic degradation on phytochrome properties and discusses the autoregulatory control of phytochrome-regulated gene expression. The authors also mention a project to clone phytochrome complementary DNA (cDNA) to further understand the photoreceptor's mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
