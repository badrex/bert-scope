He found that a mechanical force equivalent to raising 823 pounds one foot is needed to raise the temperature of one pound of water one degree Fahrenheit during air condensation. This result supports the dynamical theory of heat, opposing the materiality theory. Joule plans to discuss this further in a future communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
