The experiments were conducted on chloroformed cats, and the results showed that a sudden rise in arterial pressure led to changes in the heart's rhythm and contraction force. The study found that the medullary cardio-inhibitory center and the vagus nerves played a significant role in these changes. The findings provide insights into how the heart responds to increased blood pressure and the role of the nervous system in controlling heart function.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
