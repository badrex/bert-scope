They employed a Quadrant Electrometer and two other instruments, the Platymeter and the Sliding Condenser, to measure the electrostatic capacity of various condensers. The experiments aimed to improve understanding of dielectrics and their properties, which is essential for the development of electrical technologies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
