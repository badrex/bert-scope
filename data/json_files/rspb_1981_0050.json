They discovered new insights into lorica structure and development, including the two-layered nature of the lorica wall and the role of longitudinal and transverse costae in suspending the protoplast. Their findings provide valuable information for understanding other choanoflagellate species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
