The findings show that the ear can distinguish the direction of a sound by the actual difference in the times at which a single pulse reaches each ear, in addition to differences in phase. This research helps to understand the accuracy of the ear in detecting the direction of sounds and has implications for the study of ballistics and acoustics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
