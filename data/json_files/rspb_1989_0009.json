Researchers found that dominance rank and size attained by July were independent, significant predictors of future developmental patterns, whereas feeding efficiency had no effect. Dominant or larger fish had a greater probability of migrating after only one year in freshwater than those more subordinate or smaller. This research helps to understand how different strategies arise and how they are determined by individual fish within a population exposed to uniform conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
