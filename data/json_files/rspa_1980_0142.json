They found that the energy storage efficiency in these systems is around 40%, but no permanent storage of energy was achieved due to the back-reaction of the products. The study provides insights into the potential use of hydroquinones for solar energy storage and highlights the need to avoid the back-reaction or use inhomogeneous solutions to separate the redox products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photosynthesis and Solar Energy"}
