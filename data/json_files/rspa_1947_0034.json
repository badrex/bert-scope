They measured about 250 lines at the red end of the visible spectrum and analyzed their fine structures. This research provided a descriptive account of the observations and the analysis of the data obtained, with further analysis and interpretation to be published separately.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
