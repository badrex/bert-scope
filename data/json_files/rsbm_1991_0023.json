Swann's work focused on the birefringence of the mitotic apparatus of sea-urchin eggs, the mechanical properties of the cell surface, and the study of fertilization and the block to polyspermy. His research methods involved the use of polarizing microscopy, microdensitometry, and the development of the \"cell elastimeter\" or \"sucker\" apparatus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
