The authors propose that these regimes can be explained by the plate tectonics theory, which involves mantle convection, sea-floor spreading, and the creation of new oceanic crust. They examine the petrochemical data and structural settings of these volcanic regimes, providing insights into the understanding of Earth's structure and the formation of oceanic crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
