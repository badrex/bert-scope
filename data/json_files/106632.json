Thysbaert. Pigott's observations showed discrepancies in the calculated and printed times for the event, leading to a discussion on the accuracy of astronomical data at the time. The observation and analysis of this transit contributed to the understanding of planetary movements and the improvement of astronomical instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Transits"}
