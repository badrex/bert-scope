They observed the formation of the epiblastic and hypoblastic vesicles and the presence of a membrana limitans hypoblastica, which is a thin membrane separating the epiblast and hypoblast layers. This discovery helps in understanding the early stages of mammalian development and the origin of mesoblastic cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
