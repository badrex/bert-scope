They provide a simple and unambiguous calculation of the torque and discuss why other calculations give incorrect answers. The study focuses on a soft ellipsoidal magnet and its field distribution in a permeable medium, resolving the ongoing debate on the correct formulation for the torque on a magnet.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
