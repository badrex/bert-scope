They find that a broad range of costs can be sustained in polymorphic populations, allowing for the coexistence of completely resistant and susceptible individuals. This study highlights the importance of understanding the complex interactions between hosts and pathogens to maintain genetic variation and prevent disease outbreaks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
