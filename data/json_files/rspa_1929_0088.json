They found that the absorption is weak, requiring a considerable thickness of chlorine to observe it. The study provides insights into the molecular structure and behavior of chlorine, contributing to the understanding of its properties and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
