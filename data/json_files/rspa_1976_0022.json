This transformation allows for a better understanding of the electromagnetic perturbations and the phenomenon of super-radiance. The study focuses on the range of frequencies for which the reflexion coefficient for incident waves exceeds unity, leading to super-radiance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
