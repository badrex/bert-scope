They discover that a layer of insoluble protein reduces surface tension, preventing the lungs from filling with liquid from the blood. This layer, called the lung lining substance, is produced by surface adsorption and is not a transudate from the blood. The authors also find that this layer is responsible for the unique properties of foam found in the respiratory tract during lung oedema.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
