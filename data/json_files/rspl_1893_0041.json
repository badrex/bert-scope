Abney, conducted experiments to determine the dominant colors of sky, sun, cloud, and candle light. By comparing and analyzing the spectra of these lights, he found that the dominant color of a blue sky is around 4800 on the standard scale of the spectrum. The study also revealed that the dominant color of cloud light lies between that of the sky and sun, and that candle light can be closely matched with sodium light.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
