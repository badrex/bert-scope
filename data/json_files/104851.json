The phenomenon appeared as a small, faint rainbow-like spot with a long luminous ray extending from it. The event lasted over half an hour before gradually fading away. This observation provides insight into atmospheric optics and solar phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Atmospheric Optics"}
