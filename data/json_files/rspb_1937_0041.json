The researchers found that an increase in blood flow accompanies gastric secretion, and that pituitary extract inhibits both blood flow and gastric secretion. Cold water and vasoconstrictor substances also inhibit gastric secretion by reducing blood flow to the stomach.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
