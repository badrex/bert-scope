The research focuses on embryo and endosperm development during the first five days after pollination in 22 different genotypes grown under continuous light. The results show that the pattern of early seed development is similar across wheat, rye, Triticale, and barley, with some variations in the rate between genotypes. The study provides a baseline for further research on abnormal seed development and factors influencing the rate and extent of early embryo and endosperm development in these important crop species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
