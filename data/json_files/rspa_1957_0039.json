They discovered two main features: striated faces with shallow ruts and network patterns with crystallographically oriented structures. The authors suggest that these patterns may be formed through natural etching or solution processes, providing insights into the formation of diamond structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
