They found that the specific heat of the gas changes at around 145\u00b0C, indicating a change in the form of the molecule. The authors discuss the implications of this change and suggest that further measurements of specific heat and molecular polarisation could provide more insight into the nature of the carbon dioxide molecule.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Structure"}
