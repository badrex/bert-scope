The results show that chromium additives affect the gas-phase chemistry and cause significant catalysis of radical recombination. The study also examines the solid-phase particles in the flames and their interaction with gaseous chromim-containing constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
