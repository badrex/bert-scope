He explains the process of creating a mixture of ice, common salt, and other salts to achieve low temperatures. The experiments conducted by the author led to the freezing of water and mercury, demonstrating the effectiveness of the ice and salt mixture in producing artificial cold.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
