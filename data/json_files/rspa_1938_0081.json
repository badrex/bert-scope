The authors found that the majority of lightning discharges can be divided into two main classes, with the first class having three major changes in the electric field. They also identified the relationship between the leader process and the field changes, confirming that the first leader process is stepped. This research provides a better understanding of lightning discharges and their effects on the environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Electricity"}
