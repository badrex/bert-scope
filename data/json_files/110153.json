He discovered that the unequal expansion of the instrument's braces due to temperature changes caused deviations in the telescope's readings. Woodhouse concluded that partial heating of the diagonal braces could derange the instrument, and that balancing effects might occur in certain instruments under specific temperature conditions. He also discussed the differences between the clock's errors determined by the sun and stars and suggested a possible explanation for these differences.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Instrumentation"}
