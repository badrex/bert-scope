They describe the inner surface of the sac, the distribution of nerves, and the role of siliccous sand particles in regulating the size of grains. The study also discusses variations in the organs of hearing in different crustaceans and mentions another organ at the base of large antennae, which may be related to smell. The paper includes illustrative drawings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Neurobiology"}
