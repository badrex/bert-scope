This approach unifies various known expressions for the periodic solution and provides a new expression in the form of a modulated sine wave. The author also discusses the similarities between the Burgers equation and other nonlinear wave equations, such as the Korteweg-de Vries equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
