A quick stretch reduces series compliance, leading to a higher and earlier maximum tension. Introducing extra compliance or loading the muscle with different weights delays the maximum tension and reduces its peak value. This research helps to understand the mechanical principles of muscle contractions and the role of series compliance in muscle function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
