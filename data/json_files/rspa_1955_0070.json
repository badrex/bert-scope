This approach aims to incorporate phase relationships between Fourier components, which are essential for energy exchange in turbulence. The author derives a single equation for a scalar function based on the equations of motion and one additional statistical hypothesis, providing a more comprehensive understanding of the phenomenon of turbulence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
