They determined the molecular structure of s-tetrazine in both the ground state and the excited state, finding that the molecule is not as distorted from a hexagonal conformation as previously thought. The study also revealed a surprisingly large change in the geometric structure upon electronic excitation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Geometry"}
