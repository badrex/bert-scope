They found that if the acetylenic carbon atoms carry a residual negative charge, the hydrogen in the C-H bonds must carry a residual positive charge. The probable dipole moment is about 0.4 Debye, and the bond dipole moment is around 1 Debye. These findings provide insights into the chemical bonding and molecular vibrations of dimethyl acetylene.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
