He observes that the plant's volatile salt changes its nature as it approaches the sun, becoming less pungent in the warmer climate of Greenland. Nicolson also notes the remarkable change in the plant's properties when exposed to the sun's heat in London, suggesting that the saline matter in Greenland becomes more volatile over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Botany"}
