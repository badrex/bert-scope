The study examines the role of the co-transported cation in the coupling mechanism and analyzes the effects of different cations on sugar-binding activity and facilitated diffusion reactions. The results suggest that the coupling cation not only activates sugar-binding but also regulates the rate of dissociation of co-substrates in the cytoplasm. The melibiose permease is identified as a membrane protein, and site-directed mutagenesis is used to explore the functional contribution of histidine residues to the symport mechanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
