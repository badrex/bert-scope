This function is part of a family of functions that includes previous polynomial functions with more limited validity. The article explains how to generate the coefficients of the new function and provides tables of these parameters for various molecules, including ground and excited electronic states.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
