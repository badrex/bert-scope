The authors review the distribution of solar photo-ionization, the temporal variation of ion density, and the light of the night sky. They also explore the temperature distribution, density, and properties of the ionized layers, emphasizing the need for further research and exploration to better understand the upper atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
