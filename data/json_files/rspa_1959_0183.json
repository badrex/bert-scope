The authors find that the cross-section for capture is small at low velocities of relative motion and tends rapidly towards zero as the velocity decreases, making the process almost adiabatic. This behavior is of interest in aeronomy and the mobility of molecular ions in their parent molecular gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic physics"}
