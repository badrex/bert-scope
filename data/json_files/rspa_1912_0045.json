They found that the side contraction and elongation are nearly the same for two different wires, and the secondary strains accompanying the shear stress are proportional to the square of the radius. The author also discusses the theoretical and experimental aspects of the phenomenon and provides a mathematical analysis of the problem.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
