By comparing the observed geocentric longitude of Saturn with the tables of Dr. Halley and M. de la Land, Bugge determined the error in the place of the node and provided a method to improve the accuracy of such calculations. This research contributed to a better understanding of planetary orbits and the precision of astronomical instruments.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
