They use statistical methods, including the law of error and biometry, to analyze the data and determine the average size and frequency of deviations from the average. The results support the prediction that natural selection affects the frequency of these deviations, and provide insight into the impact of natural selection on wild species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
