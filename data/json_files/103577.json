This method softens the wood, allowing it to be easily bent and adapted to various shipbuilding shapes. It preserves the edges of the plank, resulting in a stronger and more durable structure. This technique is more efficient and cost-effective than previous methods, such as burning planks over an open fire.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Shipbuilding"}
