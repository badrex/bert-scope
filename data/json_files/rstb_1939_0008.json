They describe the ovary's structure and function, the asymmetry of the fimbrial septa, and the role of ciliation in guiding the migration of ova. The study reveals similarities between the dogfish and amphibians in their reproductive processes, with ciliation playing a crucial role in the migration of ova.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
