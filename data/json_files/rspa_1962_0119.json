The technique is particularly useful for cases where heavy-atom methods or other direct phase-determination methods are not applicable. The method has been successfully applied to various crystal structures, and it is expected that with the advancement of computing technology, even more complex structures can be solved rapidly.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Computational Chemistry"}
