They discovered that the nerve fibers use the energy derived from the mixing of sodium and potassium ions to generate and conduct electrical impulses. The authors found that the initial ionic current is due to an increase in permeability allowing sodium ions to move down their electrochemical gradient, while the delayed current is largely due to potassium ions moving down their gradient. This research helped to better understand the complex processes involved in nerve conduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
