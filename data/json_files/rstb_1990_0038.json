By lowering their body temperature and metabolic rate, hibernating animals can survive for extended periods without food. However, this comes with costs, such as the need to rewarm and maintain normal body temperatures. The balance between the benefits and costs of hibernation varies among different mammal sizes, with smaller animals generally benefiting more from this energy-saving strategy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
