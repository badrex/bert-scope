The researchers discovered a syncytioskeletal layer that covers the villous tree, providing potential support for placental structure and morphogenesis. The findings contribute to understanding the complex shape and growth of chorionic villi in the human placenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
