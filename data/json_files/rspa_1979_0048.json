A theoretical model is proposed, which involves the shedding of vorticity from the rim of the aperture. The study determines the dependence of the Rayleigh conductivity of the aperture on the Strouhal number and provides quantitative estimates for the rate of dissipation of large-scale ordered structures due to turbulence generation at the apertures in a perforated liner.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
