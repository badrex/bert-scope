They find that the presence of females affects the sex allocation of hermaphrodites and that the male-sterility cytoplasm can lead to the evolution of maleness. The authors also investigate the conditions for males to invade the population, which requires large increases in male function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
