It explains how the increase in cytosolic calcium concentration is controlled by ATP-dependent calcium efflux mechanisms. The article also focuses on the role of protein kinases in controlling calcium influx and efflux, particularly in cardiac muscle cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology and Physiology"}
