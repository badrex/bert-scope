The author describes how these components of resistance can be affected by various factors, such as the concentration of sugars and amino acids in the leaves, and how they can be combined to create monogerm sugar-beet varieties for better virus yellows control.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
