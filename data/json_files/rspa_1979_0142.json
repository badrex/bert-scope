They show that the failure load in compression does not approach infinity as the width of the punch or platen approaches that of the test specimen. The authors also find that the length of the precrack plays a significant role in controlling the failure mode transition. The modified theory is verified through experimental investigations.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Fracture Mechanics"}
