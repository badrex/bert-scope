He conducts various experiments to determine its properties and behavior, including its reaction with acids, alkalis, and other metals. Chenevix finds that palladium is not easily soluble in most acids and forms alloys with other metals. He also observes its specific gravity, hardness, and other characteristics, concluding that it is a unique and distinct metal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metal Chemistry"}
