They develop analytic solutions for the limit of small cascade spacing and find that stall hysteresis can be severely accentuated in a cascade, depending on the aerofoil shape and cascade spacing. The study provides insight into the nature of high-Reynolds-number separation in cascades and helps in understanding complex phenomena existing in separated flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
