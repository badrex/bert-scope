They study a simple system, the harmonic oscillator, for which an exact expression for the density can be obtained. The authors find that there are two types of terms in the density expansion: steady terms that agree with previous authors' results and yield the Thomas-Fermi result in the first approximation, and oscillatory terms that cannot be expanded in powers of and are only important at low temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
