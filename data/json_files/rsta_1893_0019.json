They used a novel ballistic method to accurately determine points on the cyclic curve and investigated the dependence of this loss on the frequency of the cyclic process and the manner in which it is performed. Their findings contribute to the understanding of magnetic hysteresis and have practical implications for the design and efficiency of transformers."}
