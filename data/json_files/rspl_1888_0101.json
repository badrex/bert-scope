The authors found that the main supply of nerves for the renal vessels comes from the 10th to the 13th dorsal nerves. They also discovered that vaso-dilator nerves exist for the vessels of the kidney, which can cause renal expansion without affecting blood pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
