It finds that extracellular release increases with decreasing population density and suggests that less productive waters have a higher relative release of extracellular products. The study also highlights the importance of considering extracellular products in productivity estimation methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
