They discover that British late Namurian Carbonicola faunas were probably derived from marine ancestors in late time, and that bivalve burrows played a crucial role in their evolution and adaptation to changing environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
