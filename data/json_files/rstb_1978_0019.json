They identify Climacoceras and Canthumeryx as giraffoids based on their lower canines and place them in new families, Climacoceridae and Canthumerycidae, respectively. The study assesses the relations of giraffoids using phylogenetic systematics and provides a classification of the giraffoids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
