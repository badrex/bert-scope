This technique allows for the measurement of vibration-rotation spectra of strongly bound 'classical anions' by taking advantage of the Doppler effect resulting from the net drift motion of ions in the electric field of a positive column plasma. The technique is demonstrated through the study of hydroxide and other molecular anions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
