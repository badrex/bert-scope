The researchers found that in a fasting cat, almost all bile salts are contained in the gallbladder bile, while the amount in the continuously secreted hepatic bile is minimal. The study also demonstrates the role of the small intestine in the enterohepatic circulation of bile salts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
