He shows that elliptic integrals of the second order represent an arc of a plane ellipse and introduces the concept of Hyperconic Sections. Booth also demonstrates that the properties of elliptic integrals can be derived from their geometrical types, which were previously unknown. He discusses twelve distinct cases of elliptic integrals and their relations, and hopes to extend his research to elliptic integrals with imaginary parameters in future work.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
