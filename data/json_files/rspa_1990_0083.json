The author presents a power-law continuum model for small-strain nonlinear elasticity and develops micromechanical models based on two mechanisms for the anomalous pressure scaling: point-like or conical asphericity in single contacts and variation in the number density of Hertzian contacts due to buckling of particle chains. The analysis suggests that pressure-dependence of elasticity may provide a useful means of characterizing the state of consolidation and stability of dense particulate media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
