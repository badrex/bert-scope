This research aimed to understand the range of diversities in these organs and determine the extent to which their structural similarities indicate relationships within the Anura group. The study provides valuable insights into the anatomy and evolution of Anura species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
