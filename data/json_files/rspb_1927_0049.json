It was found that infection occurs only when two different genders of the fungi are present, with a 91% success rate. The study also showed that pure oat smut would not infect barley seedlings, and pure barley smut would not infect oat seedlings. The hyphae responsible for infection are called \"fusion-hyphae.\"", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
