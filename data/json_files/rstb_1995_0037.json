The researchers found that phagostimulants, such as inositol, sucrose, and their combination, suppress the response of sinigrin-sensitive cells in both species. These findings provide a functional basis for understanding the deterrent effect of sinigrin in similar background mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
