The authors propose a mechanism that may participate in the cooperative effect, which involves the production of an antigen-specific macrophage cytophilic factor by thymus-derived cells. They also highlight the importance of clarifying the role of this mechanism in antibody formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
