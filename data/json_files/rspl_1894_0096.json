The experiments show that while the height and surface tension of the mixtures are not necessarily the mean of the individual liquids, the coefficient of decrease of molecular surface-energy and calculated molecular weights are true means of the two liquids. The findings provide insight into the behavior of different liquid mixtures and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
