They discovered that in all species, the texture that develops has the basal plane of the unit cell in each crystal system tending to lie parallel to the shell surface. The aragonite in turtle shells has unique peak intensity values and is unusually stable, showing no partial inversion to calcite after grinding.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Crystallography"}
