They found 16 species of mammals, 61 species of resident land- and freshwater birds, 20 species of reptiles, and one amphibian. The fauna is clearly of Indo-Australian origin, with some species having exclusively Pacific island distributions and others being endemic. The authors discuss the distribution, ecology, and habitat preferences of these species, as well as the process of colonization by immigration.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
