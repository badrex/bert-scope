They determine the absorption spectra of oxidized and reduced cytochrome c and their compounds with ligands, and discuss the nature of these compounds in relation to their biological functions. The study also examines the thermostability and purity of cytochrome c, as well as the similarities and differences between yeast and mammalian cytochrome c.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
