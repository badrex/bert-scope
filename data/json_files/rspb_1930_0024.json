They describe how the tracheal tubes contain a variable amount of liquid, which moves based on the activity of the tissues and the demand for oxygen. The author provides experimental evidence using mosquito larvae to support their theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Physiology"}
