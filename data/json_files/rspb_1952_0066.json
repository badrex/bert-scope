The results show that diploid strains have a greater potential for growth than haploid strains, but this potential only manifests after the process of adaptation. The findings suggest that changes in the cell's organization and key structures may be gained or lost during mating or segregation, and that the more elaborate organization needed to exploit these potentialities may be more difficult to establish.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
