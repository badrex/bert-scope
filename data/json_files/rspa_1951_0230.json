The research shows that oxygen-using capacity of the added substance is crucial in determining the effect on the limit. The findings suggest that branching chain reactions and radical diffusion play a significant role in governing the limits of the flames studied.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
