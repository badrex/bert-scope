The authors use computer simulations and the Monte Carlo technique to analyze various parameters, such as the electron size, muon size, and depth of cascade maximum development. They identify the origin of these fluctuations and evaluate the correlations between different components of the showers and their longitudinal development. The findings can help improve the design of experiments aimed at determining the nature of high-energy primary particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
