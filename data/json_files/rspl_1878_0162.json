They explain how the uterus's walls bulge during inspiration, assisting in the movement of fluids within the uterus and improving circulation. The author also notes that moderate exercise can help expedite the flow of fluids in the uterine vessels, while sudden, severe actions can lead to vessel rupture and blood effusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Obstetrics"}
