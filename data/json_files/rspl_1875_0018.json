E. Thorpe and A. W. Rucker. They collected water from the Atlantic and conducted experiments to determine the law of thermal expansion of sea-water. The authors compared their results with previous studies and discussed discrepancies in the methods used in those studies. The article provides a table and directions for calculating the specific gravity of sea-water at different temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
