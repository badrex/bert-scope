James Cook conducted astronomical observations at King George's Island in the South Sea, as appointed by the Royal Society. They used an astronomical clock, an astronomical quadrant, and two reflecting telescopes to make precise measurements of the Sun's altitude and limb. These observations helped improve timekeeping and navigation techniques, and provided valuable data for the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
