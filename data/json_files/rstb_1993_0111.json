It explains how these models, based on atmospheric circulation fundamentals, helped understand major climate changes driven by continental movements. Despite their simplicity, these models have proven to be robust and useful in predicting climate patterns for different geological periods.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Palaeoclimatology"}
