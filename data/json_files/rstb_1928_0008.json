The study provides a detailed account of the species' embryonic stages, focusing on the differentiation of the germinal disk, gastrulation, and the formation of various body parts. The research also discusses the challenges faced in studying the development of Malacostracan species and the techniques used to overcome these obstacles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Arthropod Biology > Crustacean Biology"}
