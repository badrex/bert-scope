They found that minisatellite locus MS32 is monomorphic in great apes and monkeys, while minisatellite MSI shows extreme variability in humans. The results suggest that short minisatellites are stable within the genome, and the degree of polymorphism at a given locus can change dramatically over a short period of evolutionary time.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
