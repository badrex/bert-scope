The coelomic fluid contains various microorganisms and amoeboid cells that help the earthworm defend itself against parasites and pathogens. The cells exhibit amoeboid movements and can form plasmodia to combat these threats.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
