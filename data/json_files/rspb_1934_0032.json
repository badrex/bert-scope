This theory helps explain the chemical and physical behavior of amino-acids, and the author elaborates on the implications of this theory for titration methods, such as the alkalimetric formaldehyde, alcohol, and acetone titrations. The zwitterion theory provides a better understanding of the dissociation behavior of amino-acids and their titration constants.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
