The authors derive an approximate multi-dimensional transfer equation for heat radiation from Schwarzschild's equation and provide a unified approach to the problem of radiative heat transfer in natural convection. The solution curves for representative values of parameters are obtained and compared with previous publications, while also deriving asymptotic cases for large and small absorption coefficients.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
