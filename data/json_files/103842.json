This method allows for determining latitude without the need for the horizon, which is an inconvenience in calm weather. The spirit level is composed of a glass tube with scales of degrees, and it can be set on a limb of the quadrant. The instrument can be supported by a staff resting on the floor, and it can be used with a telescope or plain sights. This method is useful for marine navigation and can be acceptable for public use.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
