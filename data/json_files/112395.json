The authors found that the average maximum temperature of the day in young people is 99.8\u00b0F, with a 2\u00b0F diurnal variation. In older individuals, the diurnal variation is smaller or absent. Food intake does not affect these variations, and while cold baths can lower surface temperature, they do not impact the diurnal variation. Hot baths can raise body temperature but do not affect the diurnal variation either.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
