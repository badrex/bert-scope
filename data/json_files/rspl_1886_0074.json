The authors describe a new method to increase the sensitivity of these instruments by adjusting their zero point, allowing for more accurate measurements of smaller currents. This discovery led to the development of more precise and efficient electrical measuring devices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
