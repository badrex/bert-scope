They discuss zonal functions and their applications in solving problems related to the potentials of toroidal geometries under the action of electrified rings or points of electricity. The authors also provide formulas for the electrical capacity of anchors and toroidal geometries.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
