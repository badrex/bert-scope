They found that human foetal haemoglobin has a lower affinity for oxygen than maternal haemoglobin. The study also showed that dilution of adult haemoglobin significantly alters its oxygen dissociation curve, while foetal haemoglobin is less affected by dilution. This explains the reversed relationship between foetal and maternal haemoglobins when comparing dilute solutions and suspensions of corpuscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
