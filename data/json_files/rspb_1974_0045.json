The research focuses on the ultrastructure and changes that occur in the sperm cells during the spermiogenesis process. The findings provide insights into the complex structure of the sperm cells and the role of microtubules in the formation of the mature nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
