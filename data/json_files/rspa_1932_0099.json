They employed graphical integrations for a nuclear separation of atomic units to avoid unjustified series expansions. The sequence of the levels matched experimental findings, and the numerical values of the intervals between combining levels agreed well with the experimental data interpretation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
