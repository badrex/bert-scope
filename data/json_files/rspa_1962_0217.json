They found that the uninhibited pyrolysis of paraffins is more complex than previously thought, and the free-radical mechanism proposed by Rice provides a good quantitative account of the reactions. The study also highlights the importance of gas chromatography in analyzing reaction products and measuring reaction rates accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
