It explains how relaxation processes occur in various transport phenomena, such as heat conduction, diffusion, and viscosity, and how these processes are influenced by frequency. The author also explores the differences between shear and volume viscosity and their effects on momentum and energy flow in fluids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
