The theory is based on the concept of nearly free electrons scattered by the screened pseudopotentials of the assembly of ions. The author discusses the limitations and extensions of the pseudopotential approach and its applications to various disordered systems, such as liquid semiconductors, metallic vapors, and semiconductivity glasses.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
