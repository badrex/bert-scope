The authors found that the efficiency of hydrogen as an inert gas in this process is more similar to helium and argon. The results show that the removal of bromine atoms by the surface does not involve a simple diffusion effect, and the rate of reaction is influenced by factors such as pressure, concentration, and the presence of other gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
