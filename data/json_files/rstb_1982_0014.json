The author examines the factors affecting nitrogen fixation, such as nodulation, temperature, and the role of Rhizobium bacteria. The article highlights the importance of understanding and improving nitrogen fixation in grain legumes for sustainable agriculture and reducing the need for nitrogen fertilizers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
