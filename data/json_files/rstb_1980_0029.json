The dominant species, Scottia browniana, suggests a temperate to warm-temperate climate during the middle of an interglacial period. The fauna indicates a Hoxnian or earlier age, which agrees with the evidence provided by plants and vertebrates. The environment was likely a sluggish stream with a tendency to stagnation and vegetation overgrowth, with occasional floodings.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleontology"}
