The author, J. A. Longridge, presents new data and equations to better understand the relationship between air resistance and projectile velocity. The study concludes that the increase in resistance at high velocities is not due to the vacuum behind the projectile, but rather the condensation of air in front of it.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ballistics"}
