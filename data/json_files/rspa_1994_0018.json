The method involves developing a differential generator of infinitesimal renormalizations in the presence of anisotropy, which exhibits a crossover between the asymptotic behavior associated with different fixed points. This new formulation allows for a systematic perturbative calculation of crossover scaling functions and can treat systems with more than one fixed point within a globally defined renormalization group.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
