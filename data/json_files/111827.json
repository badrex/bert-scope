They conclude that liver cells are contained within a delicate tubular network of basement membrane, and the smallest biliary ducts are directly continuous with this network. The author also discusses the differences in liver structure and lobule arrangement in different animals, and provides a detailed method for injecting biliary ducts to better understand their arrangement and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy"}
