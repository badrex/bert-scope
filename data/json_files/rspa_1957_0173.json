They discovered that the fatigue strength of mild steel is significantly higher at 10 c/min than at 2000 c/min in the temperature range of 200-300\u00b0C. This behavior is attributed to strain-ageing. The study also highlights the influence of frequency on the fatigue strength of metals at different temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
