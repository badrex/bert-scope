The solution involves using geometry, trigonometry, and calculus to determine the dimensions and placement of the cylinders. The resulting formula allows for the exact calculation of the remaining surface and volume of the hemisphere after the cylinders have been removed.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
