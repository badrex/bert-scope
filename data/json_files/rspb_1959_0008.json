The results show that administering the drug before irradiation partially prevents the decrease in the population of primordial oocytes. The drug also prevents damage to some normal oocytes and reduces the occurrence of irradiation 'atresia'. The study suggests that the drug provides a 'dose-reduction' factor of 2 to 3 within the range of 100 to 215 r.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
