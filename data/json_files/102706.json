The phenomenon was similar to the Aurora Borealis in shape and color but was observed during sunset instead of the typical aurora occurrence. Derham suggested that the atmospheric conditions and the disposition of the air might have caused this unusual phenomenon, and he hoped that it could contribute to understanding the Aurora Borealis better.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Sky Observations"}
