They found that the magnetic field increased the rate of subsidence in nickel and decreased it in iron. The hardness of the metal and the effect of drawing and annealing on the wires were also studied, showing that the magnetic field's impact on internal viscosity depends on the metal's hardness.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Properties"}
