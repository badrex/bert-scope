They determine the transition matrix of the crack and explore the scattering by two cracks using a multi-centred matrix approach. The back-scattered longitudinal far field amplitude is computed in both frequency and time domains, highlighting the effects of multiple scattering.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanics"}
