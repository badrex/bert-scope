They observed five types of records, including fully established detonations and detonations with temperature steps during the flow period. The experiments were conducted using a shock tube with simultaneous measurements of gas pressure, shock speed, light emission, and the spectrum of emitted light. The results provide insights into the initiation and development of detonations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
