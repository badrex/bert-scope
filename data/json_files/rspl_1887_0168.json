They discovered that pearls have a different composition than mother-of-pearl, containing less water and more organic matter. The authors also discussed the hardness and solubility of pearls, explaining that they are denser and harder than mother-of-pearl and are not easily dissolved in vinegar.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
