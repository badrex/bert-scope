J. Bhabha and S. K. Chakrabarty present a more accurate theoretical treatment of cascade processes in particle physics, focusing on the effect of collision loss on the energy spectrum of electrons. They provide a mathematical solution that allows for energy distribution calculations for all energies, including those near and below the critical energy. This solution is valid for various depths and offers a quantitative insight into the impact of collision loss on the energy spectrum of cascade electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
