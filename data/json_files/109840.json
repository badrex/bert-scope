The Astronomer Royal's previous and current catalogs show an estimated error of not more than one-fourth of a second, with the greatest difference observable being two-tenths of a second. A comparative catalog of the stars' places in 1756, deduced from Dr. Bradley's observations, is also provided, along with a column of annual proper motions for each star.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrometry"}
