They found that positive and negative charges in thunderclouds affect the surrounding environment, with positive polarity clouds carrying negative charges to the earth and positive charges to the upper atmosphere. This discovery helps to understand the mechanism of the negative charge on the earth's surface and the behavior of lightning flashes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
