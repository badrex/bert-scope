They used the calorimeter to measure heats of mixing for pairs of liquids, such as carbon tetrachloride-chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, and benzene solutions of biphenyl in benzene. The results are examined in the context of current theories of solutions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
