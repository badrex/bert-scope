They discovered that stimulating specific areas of the cortex can cause inhibition and contraction of antagonistic muscles, a phenomenon they called \"reciprocal innervation.\" This finding sheds light on how the brain controls muscle movements and could have implications for understanding neurological disorders.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
