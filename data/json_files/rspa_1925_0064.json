They found that the decomposition followed a unimolecular law and that the unimolecular velocity constant was proportional to the concentration of the reaction product. The authors also investigated the influence of various factors, such as the carbon dioxide stream, the degree of dryness, and the presence of polar substances, on the reaction's velocity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
