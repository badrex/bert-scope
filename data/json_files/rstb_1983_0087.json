Bacterial products can also influence the balance between T helper and suppressor cells, as well as the secretion of factors that affect immune responses. The author highlights the importance of understanding these mechanisms for the development of new therapeutic strategies and the natural role of the microbial flora in regulating the immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
