They analyze the behavior of the changes in the magnetic field and the average diurnal variations on quiet and disturbed days. The study reveals the different zones of the disturbance field and the seasonal changes in the behavior of the disturbing vector in the horizontal and vertical planes. The results suggest that the main current producing the magnetic disturbance is located between the latitudes of Sodankyla and Fort Rae, with Eskdalemuir just to the north of the current line.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
