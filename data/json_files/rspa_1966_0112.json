They found that the oil film thickness was accurately predicted by the theory, providing strong evidence for a viscous surface layer about 1000 \u00c5 thick, which correlates with the \"lubricating power\" of the tested oils. This research contributes to understanding the lubrication of heavily loaded point contacts in engineering applications."}
