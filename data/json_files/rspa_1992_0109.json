They focus on the case of steady oscillation and constant thermal properties, providing a reduced temperature distribution that can be used to improve thermal diffusivity measurements and study the influence of periodic temperature changes during thermal treatments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer"}
