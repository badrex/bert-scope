The authors use asymptotic and computer-aided techniques from bifurcation theory to study the Young-Laplace equation that governs meniscus shape. They find that changes in these parameters can alter the connectivity of equilibrium families and affect the stability of the menisci. The study compares numerical and asymptotic results to predict the stability and behavior of rotating captive drops.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
