Researchers found that modifications in the structure of oxytocin led to changes in receptor binding and biological effects. The study also explored the role of magnesium ions in enhancing the binding of these analogues to the receptor. Additionally, the article highlights the development of a competitive inhibitor, methyloxytocin, which can block the action of oxytocin and vasopressin on the rat's blood pressure and vascular smooth muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
