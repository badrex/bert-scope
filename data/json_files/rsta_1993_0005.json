They use a melting model to show that the activity ratio in the initial melt may not be equal to the bulk source ratio, and that the extracted melt's ratio can vary depending on the rate of melting. The authors estimate the mantle Th/U ratios from available data for mid-ocean ridge basalts (MORB) glasses, finding a value lower than the bulk Earth and the sources of plume basalts from Iceland and Hawaii. This study helps to understand the circulation patterns in the mantle and the exchange of material between the upper and lower mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
