The instrument detects thermal emission from the constituents and uses a pressure modulator to selectively measure water vapor, a crucial component in the hydrogen system and a source of hydroxyl radicals. The first flight of the instrument successfully retrieved a water vapor profile in the range of 15-40 km.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Physics"}
