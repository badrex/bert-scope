The observations aimed to compare the values of secular change in declination, horizontal force, and inclination with those at Kew Observatory. The results show that the mean value of declination for the British Isles is 0.2 greater than at Kew, while the mean horizontal force change appears to be 3\u00b0 less. The study also highlights the differences in values between sea and shore observations and the need for further investigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
