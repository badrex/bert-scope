They found that microorganisms in both filtered and unfiltered river water can multiply rapidly at 20\u00b0C and even more so at incubator temperatures (35\u00b0C). However, over time, the number of microorganisms in unfiltered water tends to decrease. The author also observed that microorganisms in filtered river water multiply more quickly than those in unfiltered water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Microbiology"}
