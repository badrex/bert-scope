The authors explore the filament lattice of striated muscle and the role of actin and myosin filaments in muscle contraction. They also investigate the 'paramyosin' pattern in molluscan muscles and propose a model for the organization of 'paramyosin' in thick filaments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Contraction"}
