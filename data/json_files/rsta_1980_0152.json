It describes the seasonal variation of temperature in these layers, focusing on longitudinal and hemispheric differences. The study highlights the role of planetary waves in the general circulation of the stratosphere during winter and the impact of solar heating on temperature differences between the hemispheres. The article also discusses the transition from winter to summer circulation and the influence of the quasi-biennial oscillation on wind patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
