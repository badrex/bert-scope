They found that these retroviruses can be transmitted vertically from parent to progeny and horizontally as infectious particles. The study of these endogenous retroviruses and their genetic elements can help identify new genetic factors involved in neoplasia and the expression of retroviral genes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
