It reviews and compares the properties of compounds such as Krogmann salt (KCP(Br)) and bis(oxalato)platinate salts. The author explains the requirements for the formation of one-dimensional metals and the role of inter-stack interactions in their properties. The article also explores the metal-to-semiconductor transitions and the development of superstructures in these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
