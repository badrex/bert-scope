The study focuses on the mechanisms of creep in olivine, which helps understand the deformation and movement of the Earth's mantle. The authors discuss the effect of pressure on the creep rate and the importance of porosity-free deformation data for accurate predictions of the Earth's mantle behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
