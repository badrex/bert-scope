They found that neither the /3- nor the 7-ray activities of radium C, the active deposit, or the emanation suffer any change in amount of activity or rate of decay at high temperatures. The abnormal effects observed by other workers can be explained by changes in the distribution of active matter in the tube and the average path of /3-rays through the quartz tube.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
