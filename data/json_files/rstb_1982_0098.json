Their effects on industry and the environment arise mainly from acid production, hydrogen sulphide formation, and oxygen removal. The author surveys various industries and environments affected by these bacteria, including water pollution, metal corrosion, and mineral deposition. The article highlights the need for better understanding and management of these bacteria to minimize their negative impacts and harness their potential benefits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
