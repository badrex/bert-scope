The research finds that pine trees grew in different circumstances and their ages were asynchronous within and between the two areas studied. The findings challenge the Blytt and Sernander climatic scheme, which suggested that wet oceanic periods alternated with dry continental ones during post-glacial times. The study concludes that pine stumps cannot be taken as evidence in support of dry Boreal and sub-Boreal periods in the Blytt and Sernander climatic scheme.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Palaeoecology"}
