The research shows that peat formation in the area began during the late-glacial period and continued until recent times, with a brief interruption between 10,000 and 8,800 years ago. The late-glacial vegetation was gradually replaced by woodlands, which never developed a closed canopy. From 5,000 years ago, these woods were replaced by blanket bogs and grasslands on limestone. The presence of rare species in the area, such as Gentiana verna and Dryas octopetala, is confirmed through pollen analysis, demonstrating their persistence in the region throughout the post-glacial period.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleobotany"}
