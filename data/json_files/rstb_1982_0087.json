They identified nine types of bipolar cells, 27 types of amacrine cells, and 21 types of ganglion cells based on their dendritic branching patterns, morphology, dendritic tree sizes, and stratification in the inner plexiform layer. The orientation of these cells relative to the linear visual streak is discussed, and the findings are compared with other vertebrate retinas.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
