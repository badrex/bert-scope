They found the end-point of the normal beta-ray spectrum to be 2.32 million volts and discovered that high-speed beta-rays form a very small fraction of those emitted in the usual spectrum. The authors also discussed the methods used to find the maximum energies in beta-ray spectra and the relation between the maximum energy emitted in a spectrum and its disintegration constant.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
