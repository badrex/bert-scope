The device uses a dial to record the distance traveled, and the author explains its operation and potential uses, including determining the strength of tides for better navigation. The Marine Surveyor is tested and compared to the log, demonstrating its potential for improving marine navigation.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Navigation"}
