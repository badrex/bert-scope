The study reveals that the majority of follicle growth occurs after the oocyte reaches its maximum size, and that the growth of the oocyte is directly related to follicle size until a certain point. After this point, the oocyte growth becomes independent of the follicle, and the follicle continues to grow without significant oocyte growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
