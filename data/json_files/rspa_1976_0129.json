This method leads to induced representations in the nuclear topology and provides a more transparent understanding of Cantoni's construction. The authors also find the representation and decomposition for zero and negative mass squared cases, showing that the inducing procedure starts with a reducible representation of the little group.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
