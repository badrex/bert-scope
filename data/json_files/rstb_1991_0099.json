Leaf: A Study on Dicotyledon Angiosperm", "semantic_tags": ["'Plant Mechanics'", "'Leaf Toughness'", "'Vein Structure'", "'Fracture Path'", "'Dicotyledonous Leaves'"], "tldr": "The study investigates the fracture toughness of the dicotyledonous angiosperm Calophyllum inophyllum L. leaf, focusing on the role of veins in the fracture path. The research uses cutting, notched tensile, and punch-and-die tests to determine the leaf's toughness. The results show that the veins' combined toughness is higher than other tissues like mesophyll and epidermis. The study suggests that the thickening of smaller veins in leaves may serve as a defense against invertebrate herbivores.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
