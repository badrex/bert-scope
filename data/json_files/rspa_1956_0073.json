The reaction was studied over the temperature range of 440 to 520\u00b0C. The authors found that formaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide are formed during the reaction, and the overall activation energy of the reaction ranges from 29 to 41 kcal/mol. The results provide a more detailed understanding of methane oxidation and its implications for the more complex oxidation of other hydrocarbons."}
