These creatures emit light, which is more common in larger oysters and those with worm holes. The creatures are difficult to examine due to their fragility, but the author suggests using better microscopes for further study. The observations may contribute to the understanding of light and its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
