The study aimed to understand the physiology and anatomy of these organisms, with a particular focus on the contractile zones and the role of lithocysts in their movements. The author also compared and contrasted their findings with those of Dr. Eimer, a fellow researcher in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
