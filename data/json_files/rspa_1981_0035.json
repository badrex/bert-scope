The model used is typical of dielectric materials near exciton transitions and includes plasma screening. The Fourier integral for the field splits into three integrals, each corresponding to a mode of Cherenkov emission. The output of photons in each mode is evaluated, and the fields and output of a relativistic neutron are also considered for different orientations of its magnetic moment. The results show that there are only two cones in the neutron case, consistent with the fact that magnetic sources cannot excite the longitudinal plasma mode in a medium that is spatially dispersive only in its electrical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
