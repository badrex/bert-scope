They used a Galerkin finite-element scheme to calculate the forces and provide numerical solutions for the Poisson-Boltzmann and Navier-Stokes equations. The results show that electrostatic interactions play a crucial role in controlling the approach and entry of particles to pores, and can be controlled through processing conditions like ionic strength and operating pressure. This has applications in membrane fouling and fractionation of solutes with different surface potentials.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Membrane Separation Techniques"}
