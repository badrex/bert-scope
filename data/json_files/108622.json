The elephant's placenta combines both annular and diffused forms, which are typically found in distinct groups of mammals. This finding suggests that relying on placental characteristics alone may not accurately represent the true evolutionary relationships within the mammalian class.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
