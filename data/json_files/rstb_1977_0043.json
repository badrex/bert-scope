By altering the peripheral nerve innervating a skeletal muscle, the contractile behavior of the reinnervated muscle can be dramatically changed. The number and pattern of motor nerve impulses play an important role in determining the nature of a muscle fiber's contractile machinery. This plasticity can be observed through changes in the time to peak and half relaxation time of muscle contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
