The author extends the method, showing that previous conclusions must be amended. The study focuses on the behavior of the indices in the complex height plane and the coupling points, which play a crucial role in understanding radio wave propagation in the ionosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
