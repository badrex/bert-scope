They measured the atomic cross-section at various wavelengths and found that the absorption cross-section at the series limit is the highest among the metallic cross-sections determined so far. The authors also discussed the probability of radiationless transitions, the effects of auto-ionization on the absorption lines, and the need for further experimental and theoretical studies to understand these transitions better.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
