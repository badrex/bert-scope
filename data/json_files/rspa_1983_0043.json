The authors assess the mode of lubrication in various engines and analyze the influence of elastohydrodynamic action on film thickness, considering factors such as load, entraining velocity, and lubricant viscosity. They conclude that the combination of elastic deformation and pressure on lubricant viscosity enhances the minimum oil film thickness in the piston seal through elastohydrodynamic action.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
