The author reviews the design and testing of single-barrier tunnel structures as microwave detectors and describes recent work on double-barrier resonant tunnelling diodes as mixers at 94 GHz. The asymmetric spacer-layer tunnel (ASPAT) diode is introduced as a promising device that combines the advantages of the Ge backward diode and the GaAs Schottky diode.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electronics and Microelectronics"}
