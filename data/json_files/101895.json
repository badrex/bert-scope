He discovered that the steel ring compass, when touched by the poles of a strong loadstone, behaves similarly to a spherical loadstone, with one point always pointing north. This new compass could potentially help in navigating the variations of the magnetic needle at sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
