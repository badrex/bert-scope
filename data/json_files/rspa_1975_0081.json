The complex crystallizes in the monoclinic system, and its anisotropic electrical data are discussed in terms of the crystal structure. A band model approach to conduction is suggested, with phonon scattering of charge carriers within a two-dimensional TCNQ lattice.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
