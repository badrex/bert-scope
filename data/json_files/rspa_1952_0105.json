They analyzed the free-air, Bouguer, and isostatic anomalies and found that the results align with the existing knowledge of the Mesozoic geology of the Channel basin. An area of strong negative anomalies off the French coast must be explained by intra-crustal masses.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy and Geophysics"}
