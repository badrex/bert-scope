They found that the yield of ferric sulfate in the iron system decreased with increasing dose rate, while yields of hydrogen and hydrogen peroxide remained relatively constant. The results were interpreted based on inter-radical reactions that occur when reaction zones of neighboring clusters overlap.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radiation Chemistry"}
