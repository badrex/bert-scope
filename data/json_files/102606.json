Sloane describes the plants' remarkable adaptations, such as their ability to hold water in their leaves and roots, and compares them to similar mechanisms in European plants. He also suggests that studying these plants' natural habitats can help improve gardening and plant cultivation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
