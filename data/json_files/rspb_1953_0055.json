They found that foetal urine has a low osmolar concentration, with a large fraction due to sodium chloride and a small fraction due to urea. The study also showed that the kidney function before birth is not under the control of anti-diuretic, parathyroid, or suprarenal hormones.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
