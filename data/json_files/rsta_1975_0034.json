The researchers found that substantial pore-water tensions can control the mechanical behavior of unconfined clay samples, affecting their strength and brittleness. The results show a significant loss in strength when stress is released, and a dramatic change in brittleness due to high pore-water tensions. The findings have implications for soil sampling and testing in engineering projects.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Mechanics"}
