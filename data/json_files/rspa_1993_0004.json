By augmenting the initial temperature and adding fuels, they studied the combustion of AP below the critical limit. The model helps explain the criticality of deflagration in AP and AP/fuel systems, as well as subtle features like intermittent, plateau, and flameless combustion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
