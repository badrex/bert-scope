He discusses the various layers of earth, minerals, and coal found in these regions, and how they differ from other coal mining areas. Strachey also notes the unique characteristics of the red soil found on the surface of coal valleys and its transformation into various materials, such as Ruddle and Bole Armoniack. He mentions the support provided by coal pillars in the mines and the direction of hills and valleys in relation to coal deposits.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
