The results show that shortage of glucose and serial subculture lead to initial delays in the decline of bacterial populations, while aging the culture increases overall resistance. The findings contribute to understanding bacterial death rates and how they respond to different environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
