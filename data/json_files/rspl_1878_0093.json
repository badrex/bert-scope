They describe the design and use of a balance to compare two weights and determine the mean density of the Earth. The method involves minimizing external disturbances, such as temperature and air currents, and using a carefully designed apparatus to measure small differences in weight.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
