They found that calcium prolongs the contraction of frog muscles, while potassium salts shorten it. Barium produces a unique effect similar to veratria, which is also abolished by potash. The authors plan to discuss these findings and related substances in future papers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
