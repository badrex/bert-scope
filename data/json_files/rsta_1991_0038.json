The focus is on the ability to predict aerodynamic coefficients, stability derivatives, and distributions of external pressure and aerodynamic heating rate for typical orbital and sub-orbital hypersonic vehicles. The author discusses the capabilities of ground-based test facilities and the limitations of using perfect-gas wind tunnels for simulating hypersonic flight conditions with significant dissociation and chemical relaxation effects.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Aerospace Engineering"}
