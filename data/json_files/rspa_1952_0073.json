They observed small deviations from Raoult's law and calculated activity coefficients after correcting the data for benzene vapour imperfections. The results were compared with theoretical equations deduced by Orr and Guggenheim for mixtures of monomers and dimers. The study provides insights into the thermodynamics of hydrocarbon solutions and helps test statistical-mechanical theories."}
