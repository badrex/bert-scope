They demonstrate the algorithm's performance using computer simulated data from various gating models and explore its robustness to omission of brief channel events. The algorithm can be applied to records with only one channel present in the membrane patch and can be extended to include channel gating models with multiple conductance levels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
