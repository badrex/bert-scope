The authors describe the trapping of energy between a certain stratum and the ground due to tide-producing forces and discuss the types of free oscillations an atmosphere with a given temperature distribution may possess. They also present numerical calculations made with a differential analyzer to determine the extent to which the resonance theory restricts possible temperature variations in the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
