Applications to chromatographic separation phenomena, heat-transfer problems, and situations involving homogeneous, first-order chemical reactions are discussed. The analysis is applicable to various fields, including deep-bed filtration, hydrosol deposition in packed beds, transport in emulsions, and sedimentation of particles through porous media.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
