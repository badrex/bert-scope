He founded a school of marine biology that had a worldwide impact and was known for his determination and passion for science. Crisp's work focused on the physiology and ecology of marine invertebrates, and he developed methods to study oil pollution, the effects of toxins on marine life, and anti-fouling measures. His research on barnacles and other fouling organisms led to a better understanding of their distribution and breeding patterns, which helped in developing countermeasures against them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
