They found that the slipping coefficient, previously thought to exist, was not significant, and the flow of liquid through tubes was not affected by the alleged slipping. This conclusion was reached after conducting multiple experiments with different tubes and varying conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
