They discovered that thick filaments, consisting of myosin, are regular constituents of smooth muscle, and their preservation requires mechanical tension. The sliding filament model is valid for both smooth and striated muscles, suggesting that smooth muscles also consist of contractile units randomly distributed along the cell axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Smooth Muscle Physiology"}
