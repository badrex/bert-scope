The authors confirm the theoretical dependences of the absorption intensity on the frequency and derive values for the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients. They also compare the spin-lattice relaxation rates for the direct process with previous measurements, providing a deeper understanding of the material's properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
