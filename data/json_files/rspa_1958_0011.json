They found that about one-third of the reacted hexane forms higher-boiling products, mainly dodecane. The reaction rate and product distribution were analyzed using gas chromatography, providing insights into the processes occurring in thermal decomposition and other reactions of paraffins.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
