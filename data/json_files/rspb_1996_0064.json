They found that area V5 is located near the occipito-temporal border and responds to low spatial frequencies, wide temporal frequencies, and motion-contrast stimuli. These findings support the idea that area V5 represents a stage of processing within the magnocellular pathway.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Processing"}
