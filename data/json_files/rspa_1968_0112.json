The author analyzes these laws in Einstein's theory and the Maxwell and linearized Einstein theories, discovering that a stationary asymptotically flat gravitational field cannot become radiative and then stationary again after a finite time, except possibly if a certain quadratic combination of multipole moments returns to its original value. This indicates the existence of 'tails' to the outgoing waves, which destroys the stationary nature of the final field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Waves"}
