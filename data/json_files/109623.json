He discovered that wind direction significantly affected the barometer's readings, with certain winds causing the mercury to rise or fall. Flinders also discussed the differences in barometer readings between various coasts and offered explanations for these differences based on wind direction and coastal geography.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
