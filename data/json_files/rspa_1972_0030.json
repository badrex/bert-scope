The authors identify the critical temperature of scuffing and explain the phenomenon of additive interference. They also discuss the effects of retained austenite in metal pairs and the importance of chain matching between carrier and additives in lubrication.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
