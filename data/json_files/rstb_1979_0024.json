The research found that the tortoise population is concentrated in areas with low vegetation and 10% tree cover, providing both food and shade. The population on Grande Terre grows seasonally and is limited by shade factors, while the Malabar population grows continuously and has more abundant tree cover. The study concludes that the Grande Terre population is likely food-limited, while the Malabar population is less dependent on free-standing water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
