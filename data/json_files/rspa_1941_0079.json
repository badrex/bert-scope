They find that the lack of phase relationship in the diffuse-area pattern is due to thermal agitation, which causes individual molecules to be displaced randomly. The author also compares the patterns found by X-rays and electron diffraction, noting differences in their associations with molecular orientation and intermolecular forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
