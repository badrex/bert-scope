They describe the different functions of these structures, such as providing egg cases and forming a vascular connection with the embryo through the yolk sac. The author also discusses the secretion of a nutritive fluid by these papillae, which is either absorbed or ingested by the developing embryo.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
