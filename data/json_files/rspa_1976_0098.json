The research finds that formic acid forms multilayers at low temperatures and undergoes molecular transformations to formate ions. The decomposition of the formate ion occurs at different temperatures and activation energies for copper, nickel, and gold surfaces. The density of states near the Fermi level is studied, and no evidence of an electronic factor in the catalytic decomposition process is found.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
