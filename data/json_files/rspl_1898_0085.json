The author demonstrates that fertility is inherited from mother to daughter, and fecundity is inherited from both the mother and father. The study also shows that fertility and fecundity are inherited in all types of life, and likely follow the Galtonian rule of inheritance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
