The researchers found that a well-developed carotid rete is present in some species and is associated with the non-persistence of the internal carotid artery. The carotid rete's compact network of arteries has a possible haemodynamic significance, and its existence should be considered when studying problems related to the cerebral circulation in species with this structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
