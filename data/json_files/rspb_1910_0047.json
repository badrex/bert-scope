They found that multiple water injections can cause fever and continuous weight loss in both animals. The study also showed a slight increase in antitryptic values in the blood serum of rabbits after water injections, indicating a possible immune response.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
