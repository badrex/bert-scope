They found that each S allele produces a specific substance in the pollen that reacts with its specific antibody in the antiserum. The results support the theory that the incompatibility system in plants is controlled by a single gene with different alleles, each causing a specific reaction to pollen grains and styles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Genetics"}
