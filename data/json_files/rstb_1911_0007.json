The author found that gravity, combined with cohesive forces, causes the organisms to form networks or separate groups while remaining in an actively motile condition. The research also discusses the seasonal distribution and behavior of Euglena viridis, as well as its competition with other organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
