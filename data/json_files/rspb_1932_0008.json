They also discuss the separation of calciferol from other inactive substances and its biological activity. The authors found that calciferol has an antirachitic activity about twice as great as the preparation from which it was separated, and they provide a simple method for preparing the compound.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
