They found that the alloys' magnetic intensity and Curie temperature change with different annealing treatments, and they determined the equilibrium phase diagram using magnetic intensity measurements. This research helps understand the relation between irreversible changes and equilibrium conditions in these alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
