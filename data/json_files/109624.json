He described its physical and chemical properties, such as its color, reaction with acids, and its reduction to lead. Smithson suspected that the minium was produced by the decay of galena, a lead mineral, which might be a secondary production from the metallization of white carbonate of lead by hepatic gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mineralogy"}
