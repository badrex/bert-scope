They applied this method to various fuels, including methane, propane, and n-heptane, and found that the burning velocities are mainly dependent on reaction heat. The flat-flame burner was also used to determine the limits of combustion, revealing that lower limits are lower when determined using this method compared to the standard tube method.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
