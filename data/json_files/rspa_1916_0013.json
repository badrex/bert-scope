The authors successfully reduced chromium oxide to metallic chromium and titanium oxide to titanium. However, they were unable to reduce uranium oxide, thoria, zirconia, and yttria under the conditions tested. The research demonstrates the potential for using high-pressure hydrogen reduction to obtain pure metals and metal oxides."}
