The work functions are measured using a retarding potential method, which involves a low-velocity electron gun. The results show that the work functions of these metals are sensitive to the state of the surface used for the measurement, emphasizing the importance of reproducibility in these experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface Physics"}
