These differences can be attributed to the ear bones being almost \"normal\" to extremely hypertrophied, which also causes changes in the external features of the head. The study provides insights into the anatomy and morphology of these unique animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
