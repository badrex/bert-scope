They assume that the production occurs in a few angular momentum states and that the matrix element remains constant, except for factors due to final-state pion-nucleon and nucleon-nucleon interactions. The model successfully fits most of the experimental data on pion production, including total and differential cross-sections, up to 660 MeV.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear and Particle Physics"}
