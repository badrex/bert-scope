The authors propose that calcium ions may affect hormone release by inhibiting the formation of complexes between hormones and neurophysin, and by promoting extracellular extrusion of hormone-containing particles (exocytosis). The article also highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between hormone release and the ultrastructure of nerve terminals in stimulated neurohypophyses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
