They present evidence and examples to support the idea that telegony may result in offspring \"throwing back\" to the ancestors of the dam rather than the previous sire. The author also examines the case of Lord Morton's mare, which is often cited as evidence for telegony, and questions the reliability of the evidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
