They found that maintaining a fixed temperature leads to a stable average grain diameter, and the relation between grain diameter and temperature is represented by a specific equation. The study provides quantitative laws for understanding grain growth in metals of this crystal structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metallography"}
