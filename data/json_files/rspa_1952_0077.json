The results show a significant deviation from the simple Gamow theory of penetration through a Coulomb barrier, which can be explained by the contribution of waves with non-vanishing angular momentum. The findings provide insights into the role of spin-orbit coupling in the transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
