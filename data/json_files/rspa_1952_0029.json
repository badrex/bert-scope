They discovered that the Lorenz number curve for copper and sodium deviated widely from the theoretical curve, with no obvious physical basis for the discrepancies. The results suggest that further research is needed to understand the anomalous minimum in the electrical resistance and the absence of the predicted minimum of thermal conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
