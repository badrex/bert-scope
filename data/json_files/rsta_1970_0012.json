The anisotropic thermal-vibration parameters were analyzed, revealing a large independent out-of-plane vibration of the oxygen atom and affecting the thermal expansion coefficients. This research contributes to understanding the properties of pseudosymmetric and mixed crystals of small organic molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
