They discovered the existence of nuclear absorption and a new scattered radiation, which suggests that the nucleus might be left in an excited state or undergo disintegration after interaction. The investigation of excitation or disintegration potentials requires a continuous range of wavelengths, which can be secured by using a pressure ionization chamber and a sensitive Hoffmann electrometer for measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
