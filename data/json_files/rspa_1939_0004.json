The sliding process is not continuous, but rather proceeds by jerks, with the metallic surfaces sticking together until a sudden break occurs. The study also shows a correlation between surface temperature fluctuations and frictional changes, suggesting that metals do not slide uniformly and that intermittent clutching and breaking away of metal surfaces can occur.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
