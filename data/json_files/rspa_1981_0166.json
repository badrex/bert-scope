They focus on the Monge-Ampere equation and its elliptic properties, providing a boundary condition for reflector mappings. The theorem has practical applications in the design of single and offset dual reflectors for radar and communications purposes.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
