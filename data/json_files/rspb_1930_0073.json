They observed a variation in the effect based on the area irradiated and found that the threshold dose for a biological reaction varies as the area irradiated. The results suggest that a summation of stimuli from distant parts may follow an inverse square law when the area irradiated becomes small, indicating that the mechanism of remote action is not concerned with visible changes but with an intermediate stage following the absorption of quanta and the production of ionized atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Radiation Biology"}
