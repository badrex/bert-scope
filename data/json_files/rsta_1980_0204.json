The authors develop an algorithm to calculate equilibrium shapes and stability of three-dimensional menisci, focusing on rigidly rotating liquid held captive between two parallel, circular, solid faces co-rotating about their common axis. The findings have implications for the float-zone process of refining molten materials and producing single crystals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
