It explains how actin-rich networks in cortical cytoplasm generate directional forces for cell movement and shape changes. The article also describes the role of actin-binding proteins, such as gelsolin and actumenin, in controlling actin filament length and regulating the assembly state of the actin network.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
