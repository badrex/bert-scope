It explores the current profile, safety factor, and energy principle in relation to stability. The article also presents the stability diagram of a low ohmic plasma and examines the effects of pressure and toroidal field on instabilities. The main focus is on understanding the operational limits and potential energy changes in a tokamak fusion reactor to achieve stable confinement of plasma.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
