They applied Dalton's atomic theory and Berzelius's addition to analyze the combinations of oxidized bodies. The author also described their method for analyzing these acids, which involved decomposing the salts and determining the quantities of various elements present.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
