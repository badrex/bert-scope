They examined the formation of surface layers of these solids on platinum and the friction of these layers at elevated temperatures in air. The study found that the frictional behavior of these solids is dominated by the forces acting between separate crystallites, and their low friction properties are due to the low adhesion between the crystallites. The authors also discussed the importance of the hardness of the lubricant relative to the metal, as the lamellar solid may protect the metal by becoming embedded in the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
