They analyze neuronal branching patterns and show that merging sets of neurons can lead to increased wiring volume, which may be disadvantageous. The study suggests that keeping the volume of connections in the cortex as low as possible is an important evolutionary constraint on the design of the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain wiring"}
