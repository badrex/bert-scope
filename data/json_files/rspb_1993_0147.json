The authors found that the snail species occupy distinct microhabitats based on factors such as host plant species, plant part, and plant size. The number of species in a habitat is influenced by the density and size of the climbing pandanus plant, Freycinetia. The study highlights the importance of both interspecific interactions and colonization history in shaping the distribution of Partula species on Moorea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
