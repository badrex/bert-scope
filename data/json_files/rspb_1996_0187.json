Six out of 12 primer pairs revealed length polymorphisms, with between two and five size variants detected. The high level of polymorphism allows for the study of chloroplast variability at the intraspecific level, providing valuable information for plant population genetics and germplasm collection management.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Genetics"}
