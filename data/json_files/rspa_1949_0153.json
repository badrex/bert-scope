The author demonstrates how this simplifies the computation of solutions in various cases, including the use of previously computed solutions for incompressible fluids. The study also considers the effects of gravity on the flow and the applications of the findings in different scenarios, such as flow past a heat-insulated wall, wakes, and jets.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
