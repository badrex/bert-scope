He used a heavy glass called silicated borate of lead to demonstrate this phenomenon. The rotation of the light ray depends on the direction of the magnetic field and the position of the glass relative to the magnetic poles. This finding showed a direct connection between light and magnetism, paving the way for the study of electromagnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
