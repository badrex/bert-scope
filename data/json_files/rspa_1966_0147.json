They found that the rate of reaction is represented by the expression rate, and the activation energy of the reaction is independent of temperature. The study provides a direct measurement of the concentration of adsorbed species during the reaction, leading to a better understanding of the kinetics and mechanism of the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
