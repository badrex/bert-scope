They found that conjugants, or paired individuals, have a strikingly different type and variability compared to non-conjugants living in the same culture. The study also showed a high degree of assortative pairing, meaning that conjugants tend to have similar characteristics, particularly in length and shape.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
