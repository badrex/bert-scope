They derive an expression for the non-additive interaction energy, which includes both the quasi-static and long-distance interactions. The study is relevant to understanding the attractive forces between solid macroscopic bodies and the validity of the assumption of two-body interactions in molecular physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
