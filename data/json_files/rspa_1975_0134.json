They find two distinct time regimes in the relaxation process, with a fast initial transient involving internal redistribution of atoms and a slower phase leading to the equilibrium distribution. The ionization rate is related to the smallest eigenvalue of the relaxation matrix, and the rate-quotient law holds approximately.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
