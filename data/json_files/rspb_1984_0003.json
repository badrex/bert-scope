They discovered that a'shoulder' in the fluorescence kinetics is associated with the exponential increase in the rate of carbon dioxide-dependent oxygen evolution. The length of this induction period was influenced by various factors, such as storage, temperature, and the presence of certain metabolites.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
