They prove that these equations have a solution in -adic integers for every prime if the conditions are met, and are soluble in integers if certain conditions are satisfied. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of these equations, with implications for number theory and Diophantine equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Number Theory"}
