They discovered that the contralateral afferent nerve has a preponderant inhibitory effect on the flexor center, which can be observed through muscle contraction and relaxation. The intensity of the contralateral stimulus influences the type of effect, with weak stimuli often causing contraction and stronger stimuli leading to inhibition. The authors also found that the background stimulation and the intensity of the reflex contraction affect the inhibitory effect of the contralateral afferent nerve.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
