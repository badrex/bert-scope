The author develops formulae for the case where the circulation is small enough for two stagnation points to exist on the cylinder's surface, with the speed at infinity being subsonic. The article provides explicit solutions for the flow around a slightly distorted circular cylinder and discusses the shape of the cylinder for larger values of circulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
