They found that in argon carriers, radiative relaxation and collisional crossing into the state are the main paths for populating low levels of nitrogen. In nitrogen carriers, these processes are replaced by parallel collisional quenching processes. The results show that the populations of and have similar energy dependences, particularly in argon carriers where the collisional loss of excitation energy is slower.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
