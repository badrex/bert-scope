The researchers developed indices, such as scope for growth and oxygen-nitrogen ratios, to assess the animals' condition. They found differences in physiological responses between populations and observed a decline in the physiological condition of mussels in one estuary, possibly due to various environmental factors. This research highlights the importance of understanding the impacts of pollution on marine organisms and their ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
