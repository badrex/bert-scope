The research shows that the regenerating fibers can reform specific synaptic connections in a highly reliable manner, with responses first appearing at about three days after axonal section. The postsynaptic responses eventually become strong and regular, similar to the undamaged cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
