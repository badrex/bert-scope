The station uses interferometry to measure the direction and position of satellites as a function of time. The article explains the equipment, methods, and techniques used for tracking and resolving ambiguities in the direction of satellite signals. It also covers the calibration process and the performance of the tracking system.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Satellite Technology"}
