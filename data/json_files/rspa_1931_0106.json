They found that activated carbon monoxide molecules form on the vessel wall and that cyanogen inhibits the oxidation of carbon monoxide. The reaction is sensitive to adsorption equilibrium and surface conditions, and it is concluded that the primary change takes place on the surface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
