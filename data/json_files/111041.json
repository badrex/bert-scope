The author presents maps of magnetic declination and discusses the influence of iron on magnetic observations made on board ships. The author also proposes a new method for correcting magnetic observations and compares magnetic declinations computed by M. Gauss's general theory with those derived from observation.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Environmental Geophysics"}
