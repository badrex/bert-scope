They found that the energy of activation for diffusion varies with the crystalline state of the palladium. The experiments revealed that palladium acts as an inert support for the diffusion process. The authors also discovered that the energy of activation for diffusion of hydrogen and deuterium through palladium is unexpectedly high, and the rate of diffusion increases about 10-fold for a rise in temperature of 100 degrees Celsius."}
