The solution is shown to be uniformly valid throughout the plate, and the author explores the principles underlying such a proof by considering a simpler potential problem. The analysis includes an examination of the boundary-layer region and the use of orthogonal curvilinear coordinates.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
