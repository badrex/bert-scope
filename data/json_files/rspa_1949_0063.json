They use a variation method that takes into account the field acting on the electron near the defect, which depends on the electron's wave function. The study focuses on the ls optical excitation energies, thermal activation energies, and thermal dissociation energies for silver halides, indicating that -centres play a more significant role in photoconductive processes in these materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
