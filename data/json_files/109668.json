The wombat's stomach resembles that of a beaver, and its reproductive system is different from other animals in the opossum tribe. The uterus is double and can be impregnated on both sides. The author believes that the jelly-like substance found in the uterus is formed by the lateral canals, which are similar in form to the oviducts of birds, and is used to nourish the embryo without a placenta.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
