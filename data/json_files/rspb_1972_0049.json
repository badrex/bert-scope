They categorize resistance systems into constitutive and induced systems. Constitutive systems involve pre-formed compounds that are toxic to bacteria or a combination of adverse physiological factors. Induced resistance systems include the hypersensitive reaction and the protective response. The authors provide examples of these resistance mechanisms in bacterial stalk-rot of corn and bacterial wilt caused by Pseudomonas solanacearum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
