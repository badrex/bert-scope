It highlights the need for a closer synergy between work in AI and robotics, emphasizing the challenges and breakthroughs in areas such as planning, reactivity, uncertainty, purposive behavior, and emergent properties from interacting processes. The authors argue that the construction of artificial systems can provide fresh insights into the nature of intelligence and its evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Artificial Intelligence > Robotics"}
