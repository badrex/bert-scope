He made significant contributions to the understanding of heredity, plant physiology, and the concept of mutations. De Vries introduced the term \"gene\" and developed the Mutation Theory, which became a foundational aspect of modern genetics. His work with the plant Oenothera Lamarckiana led to the discovery of new forms and variations, furthering our understanding of plant inheritance and evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
