The engine works by compressing water through a tube, allowing for precise control and continuous water flow even when the pump's suction is raised. The device consists of a copper chest, a pump body, and a series of levers to control the suction. The water is forced through a tube and into a pot, creating pressure that propels the water with force when the suction is released. This engineering marvel made firefighting more efficient and effective during its time.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Hydraulics"}
