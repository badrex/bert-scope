They found that the commonly accepted belief that all oxygen gas can be converted into ozone by electrical sparks is incorrect. The authors also discovered that when oxygen is converted into ozone, a decrease in volume occurs. They tested various substances to see how they interact with ozone and found that some, like mercury and silver, can destroy ozone without changing its volume. The authors reserve their final conclusions on the relationship between ozone and oxygen for a future communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Reactions and Allotropy"}
