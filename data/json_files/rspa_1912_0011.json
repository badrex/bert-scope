They discovered that the gases behaved differently and found a relationship between voltage, current density, and the dark space length. The results showed that the gases in the helium group, such as neon, argon, krypton, and xenon, exhibited a primary dark space close to the cathode, which was previously discovered in helium and hydrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
