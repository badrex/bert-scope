The Nature Conservancy led the effort, identifying key sites of national and international importance for biological conservation in Great Britain. These sites were managed and researched to provide insights for the manipulation and control of plant and animal species and communities important to nature conservation. The research aimed to ensure the optimal circulation of energy through ecosystems and human beings, promoting human welfare and conservation in the broad sense.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Conservation Biology"}
