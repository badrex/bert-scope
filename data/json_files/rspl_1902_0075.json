They found that starving the host plant of specific nutrients affected the fungus's ability to infect the plant, suggesting that the fungus's adaptability to the host plant's nutrition plays a significant role in its parasitic success.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Pathology"}
