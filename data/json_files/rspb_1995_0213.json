The researchers found no significant correlation between song rate, symmetry of chest band plumage, and various ejaculate features. They also found that females paired to vasectomized males were not more likely to seek extra-pair copulations, providing no evidence for the fertility insurance hypothesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
