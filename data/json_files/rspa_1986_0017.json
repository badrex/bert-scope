A linear elastic fracture mechanics model is used to predict crack paths, determine crack growth stability, and estimate the tensile capacity of the anchor bolts. The findings provide a better understanding of the failure mechanisms and help improve design procedures for anchor bolts in concrete structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Civil Engineering"}
