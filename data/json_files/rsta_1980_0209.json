The authors analyze data from deep sea drilling projects and find that different segments of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge have produced basalts with distinct compositional ranges for tens of millions of years. They use rare earth elements to test various processes that may have influenced the composition of these basalts, such as open and closed system fractional crystallization, equilibrium partial melting, zone refining, and mantle mixing. The authors conclude that the chemistry of these basalts represents the net effect of multiple processes acting on the mantle sources during their evolution from the primordial mantle.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
