The process involves fusing the stone with boracic acid, decomposing it with nitric acid, and separating the resulting compounds using various chemical reactions. This method allows for the identification of specific elements within the stone, such as earths, metallic oxides, and aluminia.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
