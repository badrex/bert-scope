They discuss the unique unstable environment these beetles inhabit and the various respiratory adaptations they have evolved. The study also explores the irreversible evolution of respiratory systems and the persistence of non-functional structures in these beetles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
