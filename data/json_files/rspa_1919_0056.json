The authors study the adsorption of gases like helium, argon, nitrogen, carbon monoxide, methane, carbon dioxide, and ethylene by cocoanut charcoal. They find that the constants A and B are appreciably constant over a range of 200 degrees Centigrade, indicating that the range of cohesive forces is appreciably constant. This discovery provides a new method of placing values of the internal cohesion of gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
