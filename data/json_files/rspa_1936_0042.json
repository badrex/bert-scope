They found that polar liquids generally have higher absorption than non-polar liquids, which can be explained by the orientation of permanent dipoles in polar liquids. The authors also calculated the atomic polarization and relaxation time for various liquids, providing insights into their molecular properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
