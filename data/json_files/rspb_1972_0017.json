This tapetum is a lipid-based, diffusely reflecting layer located in the pigment epithelial cells. The reflecting material is composed of small spheres with a diameter of about 0.4 \u00b5m, which scatter light to enhance night vision. The lipid material is mainly composed of triglycerides and a specific fatty acid, tridocosahexaenoin. This tapetum is different from other known tapeta in its location and properties, and its presence may help seatrout adapt to low-light conditions in turbid inshore waters.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Biology"}
