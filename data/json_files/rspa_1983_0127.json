The author demonstrates that a global concept of twistor space exists at spatial infinity for radially smooth space-times with asymptotically electric Weyl curvature. Global conservation laws for energy-momentum and angular momentum are obtained, and the ten conserved quantities are shown to be invariant under asymptotic coordinate transformations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
