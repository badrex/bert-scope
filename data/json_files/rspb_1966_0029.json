They proposed the replicon model, which suggests that each DNA structure, or replicon, controls its own replication. This model explains the efficiency of genetic transfer in bacteria and provides insights into the relationship between DNA replication and cellular growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
