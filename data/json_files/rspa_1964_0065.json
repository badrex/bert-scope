It describes the essential features of bubble-chambers, the production of homogeneous particle beams, and the analysis of the millions of stereo-pictures taken at CERN in the last two years. The article highlights the importance of international collaboration and the challenges faced in beam definition, data analysis, and automatic measurement of pictures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
