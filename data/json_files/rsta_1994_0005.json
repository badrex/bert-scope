The author also explores the possibility of alternative explanations for the solar neutrino problem, such as the presence of weakly interacting massive particles or an aspherical solar core, before concluding that further research is needed to determine the true nature of neutrinos.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
