They found that dividing the nerves of a deer's horn reduced its heat, while obstructing the femoral artery in a human leg did not affect temperature. This demonstrates the importance of nerve function in regulating body heat and provides insights into aneurism treatment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
