He discovered that the electric organ of the Torpedo has a continuous circulation of electricity and retains its electromotive properties even after being detached from the living fish. Matteucci also found that the action of the nerves on the electric organ is similar to the operation of a secondary pile, and that the organ's activity is renewed through the influence of the nerves. This research contributes to a better understanding of animal electromotive apparatus and muscle electromotive power.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Electrophysiology"}
