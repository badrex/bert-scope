He discovers that the electric current decomposes water into hydrogen and oxygen gases, and the amount of gas produced is proportional to the amount of electricity passed through the water. Faraday also distinguishes between primary and secondary results of electrolytic action and explains the importance of understanding these concepts in the study of electrochemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
