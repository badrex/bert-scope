The researchers found that short exposure to bright light can cause significant retinal damage, especially in dark-adapted eyes. Longer exposure to lower light intensities also causes damage proportional to the intensity. The findings are important for understanding the impact of fishing practices on the vision of this commercially important species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
