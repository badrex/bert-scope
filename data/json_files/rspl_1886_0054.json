They used a thermopile to measure the transmission of light through water with added mastic and alcohol, confirming Lord Rayleigh's formula for light scattering. The authors also discuss the importance of using a uniform suspension of particles in the water to avoid discrepancies in their measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
