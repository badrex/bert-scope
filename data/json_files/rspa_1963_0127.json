The authors observe different types of tracks in crystals like silver cyanamide, silver thiocyanate, and mercury thiocyanate. They propose a thermal mechanism for the damage, attributing differences in the amount of damage to variations in the range of electrons in different materials. The observed damage is not enough to cause an explosion, supporting the conclusion that fission fragments would not induce an explosion in a heat-sensitive material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
