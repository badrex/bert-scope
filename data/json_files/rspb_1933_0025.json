The authors found that there is a delay of about 10 minutes before the kidneys begin to respond to a large volume of water intake. They also discovered that absorption of water is a rapid process, and the early increases in gaseous metabolism following water ingestion are related to an early and rapid absorption of water from the small intestine. The findings provide insights into the transport of water in the body and the factors affecting the response of the kidney to water ingestion.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
