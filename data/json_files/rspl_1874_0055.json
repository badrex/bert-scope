B. N. Hennessey and Prof. Stokes. They used various instruments, including an altazimuth and an equatorial, to determine the time and coordinates of the event. The authors also discuss the phenomenon of a fringe of light observed around the limb of Venus during the transit, and they compare their findings with other observers' accounts.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
