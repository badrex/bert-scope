It explains how the synthesis of oligosaccharide chains of glycoproteins occurs within the intracellular membrane system and how dolichyl phosphate plays a role in regulating this process. The article also provides evidence for the asymmetric synthesis of chitobiosyl phosphate at the luminal face of the rough endoplasmic reticulum.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
