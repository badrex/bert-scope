The article explores the benefits of heterojunctions in surface passivation, monolithic multijunction devices, devices with semiconductors of only one conductivity type, and low-temperature fabrication techniques. It also highlights the importance of lattice match and interface structure for efficient solar cell performance.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
