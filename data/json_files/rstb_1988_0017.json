It highlights the different climatic regimes during the Matuyama and Gauss chron periods and explores the possible tectonic connections behind these changes. The study focuses on non-isotopic indicators, such as oxygen-isotope ratios, continental detritus, and sea-surface temperature, to analyze the impact of ice sheets on the climate.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
