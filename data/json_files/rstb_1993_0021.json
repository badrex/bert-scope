The authors describe the development of transgenic tomatoes with reduced ethylene levels, resulting in delayed fruit ripening and extended shelf life. Additionally, they explain the creation of transgenic potatoes with increased starch content, which adds value to the crop by increasing yield and reducing oil absorption during frying.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
