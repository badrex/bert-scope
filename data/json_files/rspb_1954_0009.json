They found that collagen and reticular fibres are structurally identical and that their argyrophilic properties depend on the complex of ground substance and fibres. The authors demonstrated that collagen can be given the argyrophilic properties of reticulum by providing the fibres with a suitable milieu, such as hyaluronic acid, blood plasma, and blood proteins. This study provides a better understanding of the nature of argyrophilia and the composition of connective tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology and Histology"}
