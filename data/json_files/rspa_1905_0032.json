Using this new apparatus, they redetermined the visual sensation curves and found that the previously proposed fourth sensation in the violet is unnecessary. The study also provided a more accurate determination of the inherent white in the green sensation and the blue sensation in the yellow and green part of the spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
