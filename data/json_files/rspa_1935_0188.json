The authors compare the dependence of entropy on superlattice order and explore the relation between the free energy of the alloy and the quantities in previous treatments of the problem. They also review the assumptions involved in existing calculations and discuss possible modifications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
