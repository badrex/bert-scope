These systems generate cumulative person or family records from data on events or processes occurring to individuals at separate times and places. They help provide accurate morbidity rates, measure the outcome of illness and medical care, and identify unexpected associations between disorders. Linked record systems can also be used for family record linking, which has significant potential for research.", "scientific_discipline": "Social Sciences > Health Sciences"}
