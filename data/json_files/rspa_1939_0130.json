They discovered that the blue-grey phase, known as a CuA^, is an intermediate phase that forms during the aging process. This phase is closely united to the aluminum matrix and undergoes a polymorphic transformation, which indicates that the existence of a CuA12 at low temperatures is metastable under these conditions. The study also found that the rate of transformation of a CuA12 to a CuA^ is accelerated at higher temperatures, such as 300 'C.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Alloy Analysis"}
