They found that many organic substances, such as amine salts, acid amides, and certain alkaloids, were readily soluble and formed conducting solutions. The molecular conductivity of these solutions increased with concentration, and the dissolved substances, rather than the halogen hydrides, carried the current, undergoing electrolytic dissociation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
