They prove that finite equations for the motion of point-particles can always be derived and show that it's possible to modify the energy-momentum tensor to make the flow of energy and momentum into a world tube finite. This work contributes to understanding the behavior of particles in relativity and quantum mechanics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity"}
