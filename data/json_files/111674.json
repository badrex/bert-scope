The shower lasted about three minutes and consisted of irregular-shaped pieces of solid ice, up to the size of half a brick. The incident occurred during a squall with heavy rain, three flashes of lightning, and a sudden shift in wind direction. Although several people were struck and some were knocked down, no one was seriously injured. The weather preceding the squall was cloudy with a thick atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
