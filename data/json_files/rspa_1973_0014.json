They found three distinct types of movement and discussed their relation to plastic flow and twinning in real body-centered cubic metals. The movement of the dislocation core can be rationalized in terms of the relative stresses needed to create generalized stacking faults on {110} and {112} planes.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
