This theory addresses the limitations of the spinning electron model and provides a better explanation for the doubling of energy levels in atoms. The author also develops general formulae for the intensities of spectral lines and the magnetic moment, and discusses the implications for the motion of electrons in magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
