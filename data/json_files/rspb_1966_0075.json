The frequency of the melanic carbonaria decreases rapidly from 97% in Liverpool to less than 10% in North Wales. The authors argue that the typical form is not at an advantage in terms of visual predation, and the increase in carbonaria frequency is explained by a compensating non-visual disadvantage. The study provides evidence for the relationship between industrial pollution and the frequency of melanic forms in the moth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
