They argue that the acromion, a key structure in the pectoral girdle, is homologous to an anterior process of the scapular blade in pareiasaurs rather than the anterior coracoid of basal amniotes. This finding supports a gradualistic interpretation of the turtle's unique body plan.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
