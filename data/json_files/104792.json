The orrery demonstrates the inclination of Venus's axis and its impact on the planet's climate and seasons. This model helps to understand the differences between the Earth and Venus, as well as the effects of the Sun's quick and great declination on Venus's globe.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
