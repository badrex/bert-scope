They also studied the action of light and heat on iron carbonyls, finding that the reaction induced by light is reversed in the dark and that the reaction rate is affected by the solvent used. This research contributes to the understanding of the physical and chemical properties of iron carbonyls.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
