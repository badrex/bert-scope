They discover the domain structure and complex stacking sequences within single crystals, revealing compositions and structures not found by X-ray methods. This research provides insights into the ultramicrostructure of these materials and helps understand the ordering forces in their crystal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
