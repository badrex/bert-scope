Brooke, explains the necessity of automatic temperature-compensation in force magnetometers for accurate results. He proposes a mechanism using zinc tubes and a glass rod to adjust the interval between suspension lines based on temperature changes. This ensures the ratio of expansion to distance is equal to the temperature coefficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Instrumentation"}
