The authors discovered a variation of this process where an impinging positive ion causes an adsorbed atom on the surface to come off as a negative ion. They conducted experiments using argon, nitrogen, and mercury vapors, analyzing the negative ions produced and their mass numbers. The results showed a strong peak of negative ions with mass number 24 in all cases, with additional peaks at various mass numbers. The authors also studied the effect of oxygen on the process, finding different negative ion spectra compared to other gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Gas Discharge Physics"}
