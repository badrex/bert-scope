The authors identify a region of parameter space near critical Bond and Froude numbers where there are infinitely many distinct multi-troughed solitary waves of depression. They use a Hamiltonian formulation and center-manifold technique to study these waves and their dynamics, providing insights into the behavior of gravity-capillary waves for various parameter values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
