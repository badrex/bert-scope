They examined the surface equation of state for the amphoteric amino-acid copolymer and discussed the effects of electrical charge on molecular unfolding. The study also explored various techniques for measuring interfacial tension and provided insights into the behavior of proteins and polymers at air/water and oil/water interfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
