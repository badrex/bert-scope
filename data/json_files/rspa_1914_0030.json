The meteorite is mainly composed of iron and nickel with some carbon, phosphorus, and silicon. The iron is present in two forms: large ferrite crystals and an iron-nickel alloy. The meteorite's structure consists of ferrite crystals separated by alloy plates and eutectoid crystallites disseminated throughout the ferrite. The author also discusses the mechanical properties and heat-tinting of the meteorite.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteoritics"}
