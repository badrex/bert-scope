They discovered that certain metals, not typically considered spontaneously oxidizable, could be oxidized when exposed to specific electrolytic fluids and aeration plates. This research led to the development of electromotors and provided insights into the behavior of metals in various chemical environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
