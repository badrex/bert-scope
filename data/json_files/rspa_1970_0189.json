The authors propose a new approach to describe random packings by replacing the array of points with an equivalent array of Voronoi polyhedra. They demonstrate the reproducibility of certain metrical and topological properties of these polyhedra and their correlations over larger elements of volume. This descriptive method can be applied to various problems in physics, engineering, and science.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
