The method uses a spaced frame direction-finding system combined with a twin-channel amplifier and cathode-ray tube to determine the phases and amplitudes of the electrical signals in the aerial system. The equipment is made applicable to pulse transmissions using an echo selecting device, allowing for the study of rapid changes in polarization and direction. The technique is applied to various types of ionospheric echoes, including short-lived scatter echoes, and helps to improve our understanding of ionospheric irregularities."}
