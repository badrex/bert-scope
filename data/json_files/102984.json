Hauksbee conducted an experiment at a Royal Society meeting to study the effect of air rarefaction on sound propagation. He placed a bell inside a receiver and observed that as the air pressure decreased, the sound became weaker and more distant-sounding. When the air pressure was restored, the sound became clearer and more audible. This experiment demonstrated the relationship between air pressure and sound propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
