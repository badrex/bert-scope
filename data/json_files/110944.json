Stevenson, challenges the modern theory of water composition, arguing that water is a simple body that forms hydrogen by combining with the electric fluid, which he believes is the same as the phlogiston of previous chemists. He cites the opinions of Priestley, Cavendish, and Watt to support his views.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
