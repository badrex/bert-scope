He explains how these lines can be used to study magnetic phenomena and introduces the use of a moving conductor to indicate the presence and direction of magnetic force, providing a new method alongside the magnetic needle for studying magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
