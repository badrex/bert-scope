The authors show that these flames can be acoustically represented as a collection of monopole sound sources in the combustion zone. They develop an optical technique to measure the rate of consumption of combustible gas mixture in the flame, which is proportional to the rate of volume increase during combustion. The results confirm the acoustic model and support the wrinkled laminar flame concept of turbulent propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Combustion and Flame Studies"}
