They describe the order in which the skeletal elements appear and provide detailed accounts of the development of spines, sphaeridia, pedicellariae, tube-foot discs, and the rudiments of the lantern of Aristotle. This study contributes to the understanding of echinoderm development and the formation of their unique skeletal structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
