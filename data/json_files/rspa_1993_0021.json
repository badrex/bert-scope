The author modifies Biot's original theory to include multiple chemical species in the pore fluid and discusses the implications for stress-strain relations, fluid pressure, and the behavior of shale in drilling operations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomechanics"}
