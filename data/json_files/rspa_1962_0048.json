They used a spin-Hamiltonian to analyze the data and determined relevant parameters, providing insights into the behavior of cobalt ions in cubic crystalline fields. This research helps improve our understanding of the interactions between transition metal ions and their surrounding environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
