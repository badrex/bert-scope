The device works by using a hydraulic revolution to measure the ship's progress, which is then communicated to a dial on board. The Marine Surveyor also helps in discovering the forces of tides and currents. This invention aims to improve ship navigation and prevent errors that may lead to accidents at sea.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Marine Technology"}
