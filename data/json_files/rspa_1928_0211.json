The authors used previous work on optical rotatory power and recent measurements of wave-lengths to derive the equation. They also provide a table comparing calculated and observed refractive indices for 18 lines in the visible and ultra-violet spectrum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
