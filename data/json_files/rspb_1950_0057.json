They explore the use of mathematical models and equations to describe growth and analyze the challenges in disentangling growth curves from size frequency distribution curves. The authors also examine Huxley's allometric growth equation and its application in studying differential growth rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Growth Modeling"}
