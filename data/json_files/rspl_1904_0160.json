They find that when the rate of diffusion is much greater than the observed reaction-velocity, the concentration at the surface of the particles is maintained at a level close to the average concentration in the solution, making the effect of convection negligible. This suggests that the observed reaction-velocity depends only on the diffusion and convection of the reacting material to the boundary, supporting Nernst's hypothesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
