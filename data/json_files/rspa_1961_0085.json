They identified and estimated the yields of peroxides in the combustion products of various hydrocarbons. The results suggest that peroxides play a significant role in the oxidation process, with chain branching due to homogeneous peroxide decomposition being important up to around 350\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
