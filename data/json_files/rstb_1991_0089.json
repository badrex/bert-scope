It highlights the importance of selecting appropriate sequences for alignment, commonality of function, taxonomic breadth, and appropriate rates of evolution. The authors suggest that focusing on molecules with long lengths of homogeneous secondary structure and correcting for superimposed nucleotide substitutions can improve the resolution of molecular clocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
