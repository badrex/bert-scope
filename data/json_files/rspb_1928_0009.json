The results showed that the treated insects had a higher proportion of melanistic individuals, suggesting that manganese chloride played a role in the induction of melanism. Further breeding experiments confirmed the inheritance of melanism in the treated insects.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
