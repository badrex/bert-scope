They conducted experiments with soft iron horseshoes and copper wire coils, finding that the soft iron could hold a magnetic state for an extended period. This challenges the common belief that only hardened steel has the ability to retain magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
