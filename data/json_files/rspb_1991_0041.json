Capsaicin blocks activity in C-fibers, a type of nerve fiber that is sensitive to pain. This finding helps explain why the receptive fields of cortical neurons expand after peripheral denervation, such as in the case of amputation or local anesthesia. The study provides insight into the role of C-fibers in masking inhibition and the organization of the body-surface representation in the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Sensory Perception"}
