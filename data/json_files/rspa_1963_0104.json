It examines the boundary conditions imposed by the expansion of the universe and investigates whether the phase relations between sources can eliminate the divergence. The study focuses on the Einstein-de Sitter and steady-state models, considering their implications for the behavior of retarded and advanced potentials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cosmology"}
