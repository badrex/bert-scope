They discovered that the flash photolysis of sulfur dioxide results in the temporary disappearance of its spectrum, which then slowly regains its original intensity. The isothermal flash photolysis of sulfur trioxide also produces vibrationally excited SO, and the primary photochemical step in this reaction is discussed. The findings contribute to the understanding of the properties and behavior of these molecules under specific conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy and Photochemistry"}
