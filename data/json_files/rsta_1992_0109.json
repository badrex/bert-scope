This method involves the adaptive movement of nodes to reduce the number of nodes needed to solve the problem, making it applicable to non-stationary flow problems with moving regions of rapid change. The method minimizes an error measure containing a function of the time derivatives of the solution to obtain a matrix equation for node velocities. This approach allows for more accurate and efficient solutions to complex problems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
