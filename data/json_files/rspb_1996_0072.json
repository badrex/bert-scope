The results reveal genetic divergence between clones with different breeding systems, suggesting an ancient origin of asexuality. A linked DNA marker is identified, which can be used to diagnose the breeding system and further study the gene(s) controlling the mode of reproduction in aphids.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
