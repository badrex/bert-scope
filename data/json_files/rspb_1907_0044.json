They discovered a new alkaloid called \"Cygnine\" and analyzed other toxic substances such as Cygnose, Gastrolobic Acid, and Gastrolobin. Their findings contribute to understanding the toxic properties of these plants and help in mitigating the losses caused by them in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alkaloids and Plant Toxicology"}
