It explores the approximation of attractors, large eddy simulations, and multiscale methods, as well as the connection between the conventional approach of Kolmogorov and the dynamical systems theory approach. The study focuses on two-dimensional flows and three-dimensional flows that remain smooth, providing insights into the behavior of small and large eddies in turbulent flows.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
