He discovers that crystals can point in a specific direction when placed in a magnetic field, due to their magnecrystallic axis. This phenomenon is not caused by attraction or repulsion but is related to the crystalline structure of the material. Faraday also explores the effects of magnetism on various other materials, such as antimony, iridium, osmium, and sulfates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism and Electromagnetism"}
