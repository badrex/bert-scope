They used two techniques, isomerization of cis-to-butene-2 and sensitized phosphorescence of biacetyl, to determine the ratio of intersystem crossing. The results showed that reaction (5) of the mechanism was not a significant mode of disappearance for excited ketone molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
