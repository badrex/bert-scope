The authors construct thermo-mechanical models to understand how changes in plate velocity can induce magmatic activity. They find that temperature adjustments occur in the asthenosphere after a plate velocity change, which can lead to significant geological events such as metamorphism, magmatism, and epipyrgeny.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Plate Tectonics"}
