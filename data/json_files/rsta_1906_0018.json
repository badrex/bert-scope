They analyze two problems: determining the figures and secular stability of two liquid masses without relative motion, and Roche's problem, where one mass is replaced by a rigid sphere. The study uses ellipsoidal harmonic analysis and reveals that limiting stability occurs when the masses are close together, challenging the previous understanding of the Roche limit.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
