These cells are found in various regions of the cortex and contribute to the processing of facial images. They are sensitive to different views of the head and play a role in recognizing familiar individuals and analyzing social interactions. The study also suggests that these cells may signal where other individuals are directing their attention, providing information for social attention analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Social Attention"}
