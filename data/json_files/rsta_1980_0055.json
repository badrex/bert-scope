The authors describe a new approach using liquid crystalline spinning solutions, which allows for the direct spinning of fibers with highly oriented, extended chain configurations. These fibers, such as Kevlar, have tensile strengths of 2.8 GPa and moduli ranging from 65 to 126 GPa, making them ideal for various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
