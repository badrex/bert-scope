Neutron diffraction and X-ray diffraction studies reveal that the molecule undergoes intramolecular proton exchange at room temperature, and the structure of naphthazarin C is compared to its polymorphs A and B. The findings contribute to the understanding of intramolecular hydrogen transfer in solid-state chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
