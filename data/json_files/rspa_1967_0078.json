The study examines the effect of different halides and solvents on the polymerization process and provides a detailed understanding of the initiation mechanism. The compound is found to be a highly active initiator, functioning at room temperature, and does not exhibit inhibition at high initiator concentrations, making it suitable for a full kinetic study.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
