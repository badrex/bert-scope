Blood specimens were collected from 75 Yemenite Jews and 121 Kurdish Jews, who were also subjected to various physiological tests. The gene frequencies show that these two Jewish populations differ significantly from one another, with the Yemenite Jews closely resembling Yemenite Arabs, while the Kurdish Jews have a higher incidence of glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency. The results provide valuable information for understanding the genetic makeup of these populations and their connections to other regional groups.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anthropology and Population Genetics"}
