The research examines the effects of intermolecular forces, association, dissociation, and compound formation on the magnetic susceptibility of various mixtures. The findings show that magnetic susceptibility is a property that can help identify changes in liquid mixtures, and it can be influenced by the electronic orbit systems of the constituent molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
