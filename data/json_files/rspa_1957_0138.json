The authors propose that the color centers are associated with vacancies in the diamond lattice and that the observed band is due to electronic transitions coupled with the vibrational motion of the lattice. The study focuses on isolated vacancies and provides a theoretical model for their electronic properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
