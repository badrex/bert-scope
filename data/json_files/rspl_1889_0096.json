Frankland and Grace C. Frankland, conducted experiments to isolate the nitrifying organism and study its behavior. They discovered that the nitrifying organism is a type of bacillus that refuses to grow in gelatin but thrives in broth. This discovery helped in understanding the process of nitrification and its role in soil science.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
