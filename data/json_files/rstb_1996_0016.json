It discusses the role of 1-phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI 3-kinase) in this process and the involvement of various protein kinases. The study also highlights the connection between insulin resistance and diabetes mellitus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Genetics"}
