The author explains the screening effect of metal plates and electrolytes on induced currents, and discusses the relationship between the thickness of the plate, the rate of current reversal, and the specific resistance. The author also explores the time of vibration of electrical systems, such as a straight wire connecting two spherical balls, and provides insights into the propagation of rapidly alternating disturbances through conductors and dielectrics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
