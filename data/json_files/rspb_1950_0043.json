They found that a considerable mechanical change occurs during this period, making the muscle less extensible. This change begins halfway through the latent period and is accompanied by an increase in transparency, which may indicate a change in the molecular pattern of the muscle's protein constituents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
