They explain the limitations of Lodge's experiments and introduce a new method using electrolytic jellies to observe the velocities of ions more accurately. This method avoids various sources of error and provides better confirmation of Kohlrausch's theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
