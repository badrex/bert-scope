They applied these results to low-frequency acoustic modes, finding that the force acting on an ion due to the polarization field is comparable to the force of interaction with other ions. However, the frequency remains unaffected by the polarization field for low-frequency acoustic modes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
