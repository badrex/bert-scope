The authors identify different oxides formed during the oxidation process and discuss the growth mechanisms of oxide films on iron. They find that the growth rate of oxide films follows a parabolic law at higher temperatures and a logarithmic law at lower temperatures, suggesting different growth mechanisms for each case.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
