He discovered that the gouty substance found around joints is composed of alkaline salts, similar to those found in other parts of the human body. This suggests that the cause of gout is a volatile, corrosive, alkaline salt that damages the membranes around joints, causing the pain associated with the condition.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Medical Chemistry"}
