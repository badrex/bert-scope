The author used various methods, including the \"minimal effective stimulus\" and flicker photometry, to determine the potency of different parts of the spectrum. The results showed that the green part of the spectrum was the most potent when the eye was dark adapted, while the yellow was the most potent when the eye was light adapted. The study also discussed the nature of the flicker effect and compared the results obtained using different methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
