They discovered that when blood is mixed with a solution containing morphine and incubated, blood platelets develop bright red spots similar to those found in leucocytes. This vacuolation is evidence that blood platelets are cells, supporting the theory that they are fragments of leucocytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
