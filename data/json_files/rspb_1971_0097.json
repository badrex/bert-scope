Contrary to previous theories, the first teeth were produced in seemingly random positions, and the development of a row of alternating teeth initiated from the back to the front of the jaw. A new model is proposed to explain the sequence of tooth initiation in reptiles, which involves the sphere of inhibition around developing teeth ensuring they are evenly spaced. This investigation challenges the significance of Zahnreihen and odontostichi in tooth replacement patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
