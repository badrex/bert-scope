It describes how, at a sub-critical bifurcation, the unstable manifold of the resonant saddle becomes tangled with the stable manifold of a remote saddle, creating a fractal boundary between two remote attractors. This situation leads to unpredictable outcomes and cannot be predicted even with infinitesimal noise. The article provides an example of a nonlinear oscillator subjected to harmonic parametric excitation and discusses the behavior of a one-degree-of-freedom mechanical oscillator with inertia, linear viscous damping, and time-dependent nonlinear stiffness.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
