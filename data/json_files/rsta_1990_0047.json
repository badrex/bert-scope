The authors discuss the impact of climate fluctuations on the distribution and abundance of ancient hunting groups, particularly in extreme northern latitudes. They also examine the spread of the Arctic Small Tool Tradition, which originated in northeast Siberia and extended to North America, and its connection to climate changes during the fourth and fifth millennia BP.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Palaeoclimatology"}
