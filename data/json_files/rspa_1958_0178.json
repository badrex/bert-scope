They found that the wave function's principal maximum is inside the shell, and it is appreciable at the surface of the sphere, participating in bonding. The binding energy of an electron in the wave function is rydbergs in the configuration as given by the Hartree-parameter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
