They found that the an and ft forms of polypeptides exhibit different solubilities in non-polar liquids, which is consistent with their proposed structures. The an form has intrachain hydrogen bonds, while the ft form has interchain hydrogen bonds. The authors also investigated the effect of formic acid treatment on the polypeptides and their solubility in benzene.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
