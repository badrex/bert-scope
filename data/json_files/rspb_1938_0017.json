The mutation is linked to two factor pairs, black-eyed versus pink-eyed yellow and normal versus lethal. The research shows that the lethal mutation affects growth, development, and respiratory systems, leading to various symptoms and eventually death. The study provides insights into gene action and pleiotropy in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
