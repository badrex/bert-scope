He discovered that these substances exhibit double refraction and polarization, similar to doubly refracting crystals like Iceland spar. This phenomenon occurs due to the laminated structure of these minerals and the alternating refractive and dispersive powers within them. The author also found that realgar and chromate of lead have higher refractive powers than diamond and that phosphorus is next to diamond in refractive power.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
