This approach treats recursion operators and their inverses on an equal footing, allowing for efficient techniques to construct non-local symmetries of differential equations. The new formulation also unifies the construction of generalized and non-local symmetries.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
