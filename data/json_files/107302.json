He discovered that by combining the earths with mercury, he could obtain amalgams that could be preserved and later decomposed to obtain metals. This research expanded the understanding of the properties and potential of alkaline earths and their metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
