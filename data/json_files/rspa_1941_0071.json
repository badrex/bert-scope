The author explains how to solve the perturbed Fock functions and calculate the perturbation energy of order. The method is applied to the case of zero resultant spin, and the perturbation equations for the n-electron problem are derived. The author acknowledges the valuable advice of Professor M. Born and Dr. K. Fuchs."}
