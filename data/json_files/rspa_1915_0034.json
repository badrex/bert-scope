The author uses the generalized Rydberg formula to represent these series and finds that the doublet separations tend to zero at the limits of the series. The findings support the conclusion that the heads of the bands in the band spectrum of Goldstein and Curtis follow ordinary line-series laws.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
