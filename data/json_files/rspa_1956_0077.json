The authors find that the friction is proportional to the area of deformation, suggesting that contact occurs at a few asperities, possibly just one. This provides an explanation for the dependence of friction on load and fiber diameter. The deformation behavior of polymers is neither purely elastic nor purely plastic but intermediate over a range, which can be expressed by a single law.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
