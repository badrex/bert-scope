The authors measured the apparent extinction of the incident light beam and the angular distribution of scattered light intensity over a wide range of wavelengths in the visible and ultra-violet region and a range of temperatures above the critical point for nine selected liquid mixtures. The results showed two distinct classes with specific temperature and wavelength dependencies, and an asymmetric angular distribution of scattered light. This research provides a deeper understanding of the mechanisms behind critical fluctuations in binary liquid mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
