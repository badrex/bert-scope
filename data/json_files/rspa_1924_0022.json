The results show that higher pollution levels are associated with increased potential gradients, suggesting that pollution has a significant impact on atmospheric electricity. The authors also calculate the potential gradient for a hypothetical perfectly clean day, highlighting the importance of reducing pollution for better understanding and predicting atmospheric phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
