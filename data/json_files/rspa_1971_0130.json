They found that with carefully defined experiments, stable interfacial potentials can be obtained, and the factors affecting their stability were identified. The results provide a better understanding of the behavior of monolayers at polar oil/water interfaces and help clarify the contradictory data found in previous studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
