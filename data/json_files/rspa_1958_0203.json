The authors found that water attaches to negative ions in the halides through hydrogen bonding. They also discovered unique bands associated with the positive ions of the body-centered cubic lattice, which suggest bonding through the oxygen of the water. The study provides insights into the effect of crystal ion size and electronegativity on water bands and the behavior of water in different environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
