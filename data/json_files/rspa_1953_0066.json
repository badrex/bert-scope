This method provides qualitative information that can guide numerical calculations of the solutions. The author discusses reducible non-linear equations, including Emden's equation, which is important in astrophysics, and Blasius' equation, which is relevant to boundary-layer theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Equations"}
