Dislocations emitted from sources at or near the crack tip help shield the most vulnerable parts of the crack, preventing failure. The model accounts for the strain-rate dependence of the transition temperature and predicts a dependence of the transition on dislocation density.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography and Fracture Mechanics"}
