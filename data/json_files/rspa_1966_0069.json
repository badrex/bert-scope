The authors used stroboscopic flash photography to directly measure the growth rate of disturbances and investigated the dispersion curve for disturbances on the jet. They also examined the effects of viscosity on the instability using glycerine-water solutions, finding good agreement with Chandrasekhar's calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
