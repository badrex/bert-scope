They analyze the percentage of reciprocal and non-reciprocal incompatible matings between different genotypes in a diallel matrix and find that a three-gene sporophytic system best fits the data. This study helps to understand the genetic and biochemical control of incompatibility in plants.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Genetics"}
