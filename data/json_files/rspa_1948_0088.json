The authors conducted laboratory experiments using various methods of water supply to control the swirl and observe the reduction in discharge due to vortex formation. The results demonstrate the types of instability caused by weak vortices and the significant decrease in discharge when vortices are present.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
