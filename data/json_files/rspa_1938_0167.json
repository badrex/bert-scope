The authors conducted experiments to examine Gurney and Mott's theory on latent image formation. They found that at low temperatures, there is no reciprocity failure, and the sensitivity of photographic materials does not significantly decrease. This suggests that only an electronic process occurs at low temperatures, with electrons freezing in and the ionic process following upon warming up."}
