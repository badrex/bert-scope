They analyze the relation between axial load and axial deformation, considering a rigid-plastic model for the strut. The study reveals that the dynamic jump is governed by the interplay between strain energy, work absorbed at the plastic hinge, and kinetic and potential energies of the applied load. The authors suggest an energy method for analyzing the magnitude of deformations involved in dynamic jumps in practical cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Analysis"}
