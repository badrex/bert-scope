Frankland, explores the creation of a new series of organic compounds containing boron. By replacing oxygen in boracic anhydride with ethyl, he synthesizes boric ethide, a colorless liquid with a pungent odor. The compound is insoluble in water, spontaneously flammable in air, and reacts with concentrated nitric acid. This discovery expands the field of organometallic compounds and offers new insights into the chemistry of boron.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic compounds"}
