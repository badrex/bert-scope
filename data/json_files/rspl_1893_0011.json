The authors found that stretching the wires caused a temporary alteration in their specific resistance, but no permanent change unless there was permanent stretching. The study concludes that mechanical treatment does not significantly affect the electrical properties of the tested metals, while even a small impurity in the metal can cause a greater change in conductivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
