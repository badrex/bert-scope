They found that the osmotic pressures were not accurately represented by the initial formula due to atmospheric pressure. After modifying the formula to account for this, the authors concluded that the membrane established the full theoretical osmotic pressures, verifying thermodynamic relations at high pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
