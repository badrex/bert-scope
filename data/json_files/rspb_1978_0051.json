The research focuses on the development of immature and mature gametocytes, their activation, and the behavior of microgametes. The findings provide insights into the life cycle of the parasite and contribute to understanding the biology of malaria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
