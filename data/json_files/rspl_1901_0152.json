They also present findings on the action of magnetized electrodes on electrical discharge phenomena in rarefied gases. The research was conducted with the help of several collaborators and involved taking photographs, visual observations, and detailed examinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
