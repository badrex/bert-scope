The tree has two types of flowers with different stamen and stigma heights, ensuring that only compatible pollinations occur. The author discovers that the tree's anther arrangement and stamen movement play a crucial role in effective pollination, and that the pollen transport system is safe and efficient despite the tree's unusual morphology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
