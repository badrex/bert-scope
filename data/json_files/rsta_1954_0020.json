They develop a method to prove the existence of solutions with asymptotic expansions and demonstrate that these expansions are uniformly valid with respect to the complex variable. This work expands on previous theories and provides new insights into the behavior of differential equations in various cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
