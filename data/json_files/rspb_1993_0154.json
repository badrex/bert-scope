It found a positive correlation between fluctuating asymmetry and the number of antler points, but did not support the hypothesis that asymmetry in sexual traits signals the quality of the possessor. However, a partial correlation analysis revealed a negative relation between fluctuating asymmetry and carcass mass when controlling for antler size. The results suggest that older bulls are more capable of coping with environmental stress during antler development, and thus, for a given antler size, age can be signaled through fluctuating asymmetry. This implies that quality signaling by antler size and asymmetry could be an additional component of sexual selection in moose.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Animal Behavior"}
