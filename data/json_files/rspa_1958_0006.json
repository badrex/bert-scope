The authors find that the integral heats of adsorption are greater for nickel films than for nickel powders, suggesting that the enhancement is related to the degree of disorder in the metal specimen. The results also show that the behavior of nickel films approaches that of powders at high coverages of chemisorbed gases or after sintering.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
