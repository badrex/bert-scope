The authors conducted Meyer analyses on various silver alloys containing different elements, such as cadmium, indium, tin, antimony, zinc, magnesium, aluminum, and gold. They found that the ultimate Meyer hardness increases as the grain size of the specimens decreases. The results are discussed in terms of lattice distortion, showing that for a given atomic percentage of solute, the increase in hardness is proportional to the square of the lattice distortion for solutes in the same row of the Periodic Table.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
