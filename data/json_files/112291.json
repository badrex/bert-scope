When treated with magenta, blood corpuscles became transparent and expanded, revealing their nuclei and dark-red specks on their periphery. Tannin caused the formation of bright, highly refractive projections on the surface of the corpuscles, which were more pronounced in fish blood. These observations provided insights into the structure and function of blood cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
