The authors found that removing surface films caused a significant increase in friction, while introducing a small amount of oxygen or water vapor reduced the friction. Both physical and chemical adsorption play a role in the frictional behavior of these materials. The results provide insight into the frictional properties of non-metals and the importance of surface films in their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
