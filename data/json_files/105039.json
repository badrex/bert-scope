He described their appearance, behavior, and the construction of their nest, which is made of multiple layers of coverings. Harrison also compared the wasps to hornets and honeybees, discussing their life cycle and survival strategies. The wasps' nest was later dismantled, and Harrison sent it to Peter Collinson, F.R.S., for further study.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
