H. Moseley's explanation of glacier motion, arguing that Moseley's theory based on thermal expansion and contraction is flawed. Forbes emphasizes the plasticity of glaciers and the importance of gravity as a moving force. He also disputes the effectiveness of temperature changes on the massive ice structures, stating that the expansion of ice by heat and cold is impossible due to its freezing point.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
