The author uses a method of obtaining monochromatic light from the spectrum to examine the sensitiveness of these salts to various rays. The results show that a mixture of iodide and bromide of silver gives rise to a double maximum of action, with a minimum occurring at Gf, where the iodide is mostly affected. The author also explores the effects of varying exposure times and compares the results with those of other salts and combinations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photometry"}
