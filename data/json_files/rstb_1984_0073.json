It discusses the consequences of acidification on fish populations and aquatic ecosystems, and evaluates the available evidence from field comparative studies, laboratory experiments, and field experiments. The authors conclude that acidification has led to the loss of fish populations and reduced the overall health of aquatic ecosystems, and suggest further research to better understand the long-term impacts of acid deposition on these environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Aquatic Ecology"}
