The authors explore various research approaches, including synthetic modifications of natural product models, development of metabolic disrupters or enhancers, and innovative bioassays. They focus on the extensive investigation of juvenile hormone agonists and antagonists as examples of biorational aspects in discovering highly selective insecticidal agents.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Pesticides and Agrochemicals"}
