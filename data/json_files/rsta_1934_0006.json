The analysis is generalized to include unsymmetrical solutions and provides formulae to solve any problem of stress within the specified boundaries. Two important special cases, corresponding to pure bending-moment and bending-moment with shear, are worked out in detail. The results can also be applied to the slow motion of a viscous fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
