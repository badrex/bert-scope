They investigated the loss of energy in a vibrating wire and the effects of factors such as temperature, magnetic fields, and fatigue on the loss of energy. The results showed that the loss of energy due to internal friction in metals does not follow the laws of fluid friction but rather those of external friction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
