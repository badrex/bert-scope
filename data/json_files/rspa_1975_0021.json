The experiments reveal that the existing linearized theory of wave growth in this system is inadequate, and a preliminary theory for large amplitude waves is presented. The findings provide insights into the behavior of thin liquid sheets and the role of surface tension in maintaining their motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
