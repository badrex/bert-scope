Acidic deposition can have both a fertilizer effect due to the deposition of nitrogen and sulfur compounds and an acidification effect caused by increased leaching of base cations. The increased acidity can lead to shortages of essential plant nutrients like magnesium, as well as increased mobility of aluminum and other metals, which may result in toxic concentrations. The author concludes that while acidic deposition may increase forest growth in some areas, it can also have negative impacts on soil and vegetation health.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Ecosystems"}
