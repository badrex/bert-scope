The author derives equations for calculating the flow and discusses various applications, including aerodynamics, electrostatics, and cable capacity determination. The theory is illustrated through several examples and has numerous practical applications in engineering and physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
