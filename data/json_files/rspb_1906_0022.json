They discovered that the fungus reproduces through a unique process where the female nuclei in the ascogonium fuse in pairs, rather than undergoing fertilization by a male nucleus. This finding sheds light on the diverse reproductive processes within the Ascomycetes group.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Mycology"}
