They had a unique periderm structure made of collagenous increments, which allowed them to adapt to automobility and evolve into streamlined, active superindividuals. This study examines the evolution of graptolites from sessile, colonial animals to automobile superindividuals, discussing their unique periderm structure and the factors that contributed to their extinction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
