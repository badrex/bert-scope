They also discovered a partial Paschen-Back effect analogue, where the initial terms of complex fine structures tend to fuse and form the normal Stark effect characteristic. This phenomenon is similar to the appearance of the Paschen-Back effect in high magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
