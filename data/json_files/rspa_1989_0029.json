The research predicts and explains the different reaction modes, including oscillatory cool flames, two-stage, and multiple-stage ignitions, in a non-adiabatic, well-stirred flow reactor. The findings provide insights into the origins of complex oscillatory waveforms for cool flames and help establish a comprehensive understanding of the non-isothermal phenomena in ethanal oxidation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion Chemistry"}
