They discuss the evolution of the family and its distribution in relation to recent palaeogeographic reconstructions. The study includes a list of current generic assignments for known species and a review of the relations between phylogeny and ontogeny.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
