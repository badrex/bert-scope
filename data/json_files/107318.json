The comet had a large nucleus surrounded by faint chevelure and a very faint tail. The author analyzed the comet's physical construction, comparing it to a planetary body and discussing its atmosphere, transparency, and the nature of its light. This study provided valuable insights into the understanding of comets and their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
