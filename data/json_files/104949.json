He discovers that heating milk to a scalding temperature and ventilating it effectively removes the ill taste. Hales also suggests a stove system to heat milk without imparting a smoky taste. The author's experiments show that ventilating stinking water can improve its smell and taste.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Water Treatment"}
