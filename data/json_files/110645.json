He examines the decomposition of water and the transfer of matter between electrodes without the decomposition of transported compounds. Daniell establishes the fundamental principle that the force measured by its definite action at one point of a circuit cannot perform more work at another point. He concludes that only the electrolyte, the sulfate of soda, yields during electrolysis, forming sulfuric acid and soda.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
