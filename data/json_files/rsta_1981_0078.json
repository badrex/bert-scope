It explores the storage of flare energy in the solar magnetic field and the impulsive release of this energy, as well as the dispersion and dissipation of high-energy particles produced. The article also considers the theoretical modeling of flares and the limitations imposed by current observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
