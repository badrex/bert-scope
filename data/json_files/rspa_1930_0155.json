They found that the resonance wavelengths of the inert gases fall below the spectral region covered by a quartz-spectrograph. The study provides insights into the unique and fundamental frequency associated with resonance frequencies in metal films and the absorption of light by different states of xenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
