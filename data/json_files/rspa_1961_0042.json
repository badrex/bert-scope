They found hysteresis in the adsorption isotherm and different types of adsorption sites on the Vycor glass. The results indicate a redistribution of adsorbate molecules before reaching equilibrium and provide insights into the dielectric properties of adsorbate-adsorbent systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
