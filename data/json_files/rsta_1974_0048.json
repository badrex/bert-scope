They determined the stretching fundamentals and force constants for both the ground and excited states of the ion, providing a test of the Renner-Pople-Hougen theory of vibronic coupling. The study also compared the force constants and bond distances of the ion with those of the neutral molecule and correlated the states of the ion with possible dissociation products.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
