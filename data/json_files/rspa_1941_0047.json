They discovered that the rate of double-bond migration and hydrogenation were both proportional to the square root of the butene pressure and the square root of the hydrogen pressure. This research supports the theory that the catalytic exchange between olefins and deuterium occurs through the formation of an associative complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
