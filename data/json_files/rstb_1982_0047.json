It highlights the importance of understanding natural variations in populations and the need for long-term data to assess the impact of pollutants. The author provides examples of various marine populations, such as Arcto-Norwegian cod, and emphasizes the role of recruitment fluctuations in determining changes in adult fish stocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
