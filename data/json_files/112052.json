The experiments were performed in glass bulbs filled with air, carbonic acid, hydrogen, oxygen, and nitrogen gases. The results showed that low organisms were found in most cases, except when meat was enclosed in a bulb filled with nitrogen. This study contributed to the understanding of the conditions required for the development of organic life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
