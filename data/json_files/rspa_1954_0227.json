It explores the combination of relaxation and hydrodynamics, focusing on sound absorption and the second coefficient of viscosity. The author highlights the importance of additional thermodynamic parameters and kinetic assumptions in making the system determinate again.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
