The authors found that the excitability of sensory nerves follows a course similar to that observed in motor nerves, with the make excitation being increased by the kathodic influence of the polarizing current. The study also found that the after-effects of the galvanic current on sensory nerves include an increase in excitability, both after anodic and kathodic influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
