The author discusses the challenges in studying these processes due to the complexity of molecular mechanisms involved and the lack of clear experimental protocols. The article highlights the need for further research to understand the molecular pathways and the role of phytochrome in post-translational modifications of enzymes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
