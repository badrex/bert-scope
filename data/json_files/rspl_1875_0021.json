M\u00fcller's Experiments", "semantic_tags": ["Electrochemistry", "Electrical Discharges", "Spark Length", "Battery Cells", "Terminal Shape"], "tldr": "In this article, Warren De La Rue and Hugo W. M\u00fcller study the length of sparks produced by different numbers of rod-chloride-of-silver cells in a battery. They also investigate the phenomena accompanying the electrical discharges, such as the glow surrounding the terminals and the peach-like bloom deposited on the positive terminal. The authors find that the length of the spark is influenced by the shape of the terminals and the number of cells in the battery, and they confirm a law stating that the length of the spark is dependent on the square of the number of cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
