They examined the atom emissions and associated vibrational sidebands using a variable temperature liquid helium cryostat and photoelectric recording. The results showed that the electronic transition is split into three zero-phonon lines, and the vibrational sidebands appear with an intensity distribution resembling phonon-induced electronic transitions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
