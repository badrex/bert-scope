They find that the interband Faraday rotation is mainly determined by a competition between transitions from heavy and light valence states. The study provides a better understanding of the behavior of semiconductors like Ge, GaSb, InAs, and InSb in the presence of a magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optoelectronics"}
