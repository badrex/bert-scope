The results show that the temperature coefficient is too small and requires correction. The authors also discover that a higher concentration of iodo-acetic acid is needed to poison a muscle at a lower temperature for a given duration of stimulation. This research contributes to our understanding of muscle physiology and heat production during muscle contractions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
