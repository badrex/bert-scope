It discusses the effects of blood flow, platelet aggregation, and the interaction between platelets and the vessel wall. The authors also analyze the growth rates of thrombi and the activation delay time of platelets in different blood flow rates. This research provides insights into the understanding of hemostasis and thrombosis processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
