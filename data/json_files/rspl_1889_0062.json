The authors expose the internal capsule through a horizontal section and use a minimal stimulus to record the movements. They find that the movements are arranged in the same way as observed in the cortex, with the representation of extension situated in front of flexion for the upper limb segments and toes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
