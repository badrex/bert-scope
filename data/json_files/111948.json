They discovered that when heated together, iodine is released and a heavy oily liquid distills. The reaction produces iodide of hexyl, which is further analyzed and confirmed to be hexylic alcohol. This research contributes to the understanding of the hexyl group of compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
