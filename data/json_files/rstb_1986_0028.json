It compares the growth of fungal and streptomycete hyphae and their similarities in morphology. The article also explores the growth in lower green plants, particularly algae, and the question of whether coenocytic algae are modular or not.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
