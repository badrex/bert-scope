They discovered that all three gases have bright, well-defined lines in their spectra, with neon having the most striking orange and red lines. Krypton and xenon have two spectra, one with a direct discharge and another with a Leyden jar and spark gap. The second spectra for both krypton and xenon are more complex, with krypton having a sky-blue color and xenon having bright green lines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
