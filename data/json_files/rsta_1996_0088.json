They discuss the warping energy required to form closed-shell fullerenes, open hyperbolic schwarzites, and other carbon structures. The model accounts for the relative self-energies of most curved graphitic networks, suggesting that many proposed allotropes of carbon can be treated as two-dimensional warped layer-structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
