The results showed that the 210Pb parameters were similar to protected forest lakes with no land-use activities, indicating almost exclusive atmospheric inputs. The sediment accumulation rates increased over the past century, but 210Pb parameters did not show strong signs of enhanced land-use activities. This may be due to more efficient preservation of sediments under more acidic conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleolimnology"}
