The authors compute these coefficients for a potential derived from the Lennard-Jones potential by replacing the inverse-power repulsion with an exponential term. The tables cover a range of parameters and temperatures, and the results can be applied to various substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical mechanics"}
