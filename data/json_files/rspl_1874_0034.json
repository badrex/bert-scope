They also studied the phenomenon of Venus transit and its effect on the solar spectrum. The observations suggest that Venus's atmosphere might affect the solar light, causing a shaded annulus around Venus. The author also noticed that the white lines in the solar spectrum changed color and became less visible at lower altitudes.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
