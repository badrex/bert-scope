The wire was part of a night-bolt, and after the lightning strike, it was found to be drawn straight and tight, producing a musical tone. The author also mentions a similar case where lightning passed through two wires without damaging them, but the single wire was partly dispersed into smoke and melted into globules. The author discusses the effects of lightning on metal properties and shares their findings with the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
