They found that certain properties reach a maximum deviation from their theoretical values between 30% and 45% alcohol by weight. The authors also discovered relationships between specific heat, heat produced by mixing, boiling point, and capillary attraction in these mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
