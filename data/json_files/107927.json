He used a kite to collect atmospheric electricity and connected it to a solution of sulphate of soda and syrup of violets. The experiment resulted in the separation of hydrogen and oxygen bubbles and the change in color of the liquid, providing insights into the electrochemical theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
