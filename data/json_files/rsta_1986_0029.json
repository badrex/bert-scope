The research reveals that the Gulf of Suez and the northern Red Sea rifts are the result of intracontinental deformation during Neogene times. The initiation and development of the rift are controlled by four main trends of faults, a zigzag faulting pattern, and two main tectonic events. The study suggests that the complex structure of the rift cannot be the result of a simple extensional model and implies the reactivation of inherited discontinuities in the Miocene stress system induced by the northern convergent boundaries of the African and Arabian plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Rift Tectonics"}
