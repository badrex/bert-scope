They investigate the possibility that chlorophyll is a glucoside, a type of organic compound, by analyzing its behavior when exposed to acids. The author finds that chlorophyll decomposes into two substances, phyllocyanin and phyllo-xanthin, when treated with acid, and that it may be accompanied by a glucoside-like substance in the plant cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
