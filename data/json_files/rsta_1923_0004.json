They discovered new series and classified lines in the spectrum, providing insights into the atomic structure and the application of quantum theory. This work contributed to the understanding of the structure of atoms and the analysis of other complex spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
