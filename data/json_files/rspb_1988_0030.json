The researchers found that these channels open in bursts and clusters, and they analyzed the shut-time and burst duration distributions for glutamate, aspartate, and NMDA. The study provides insights into the relation between single-channel openings and whole-cell current noise in these neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
