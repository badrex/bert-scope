The authors use Landau's two-fluid model to study the effects of viscosity, heat conduction, and other properties of helium. They non-dimensionalize the equations and choose a suitable limiting process to formulate the linear problem, which will be extended to include higher-order effects in a later paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
