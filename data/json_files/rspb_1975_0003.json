The research found that the rate-controlling factor was the rate of replenishment of nitrogen as nitrate or ammonia. Approximately 26% of the oil was degraded based on oxygen uptake, with the remaining portion likely consisting of soluble organic compounds. The findings suggest that a minimum of 4 parts of available nitrogen are required per milligram of oil oxidized.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Ecology"}
