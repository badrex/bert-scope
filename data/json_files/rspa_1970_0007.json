The authors use a non-uniform electric field to induce an unstable configuration of surface charge and electric field intensity at a planar interface, leading to cellular convection in the plane of the interface. They develop a simple model to predict the flow pattern, voltage required for incipience, and the velocity of the cellular motion, highlighting the competition between viscous and electrical stresses in the fluid layer.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
