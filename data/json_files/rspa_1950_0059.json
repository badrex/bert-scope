They find that separation can only occur if a specific singularity exists at the separation point. The study also reveals that the boundary layer equation remains valid even after separation, with the velocity decreasing after separation. The authors compare their results with Howarth's calculations, showing a rather good agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
