The researchers found that these channels have different conductance and properties in labour tissue compared to non-labour tissue. The large-conductance K+ channels may play a role in suppressing myometrial activity during gestation, while other K+ channels may provide a Ca2+-independent K+ conductance that allows cytoplasmic Ca2+ levels to rise without activating a counteracting current. This suggests that K+ channels may have an important role in determining the functional activity of the myometrium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
