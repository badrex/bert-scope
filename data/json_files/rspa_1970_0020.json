The author discusses the use of these definitions in defining the center of mass and presents a special case study of motion in a de Sitter universe. The article also introduces the concept of dynamical rigidity and its relation to the mass constant and the total rest energy of a body.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gravitational Dynamics"}
