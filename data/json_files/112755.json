By comparing the ratios of the areas of these orifices, the author discovers a constant law that applies to healthy human hearts and possibly to the hearts of many animals. This law can be useful in estimating the amount of contraction or dilatation of the orifices in cases of heart disease.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
