They adapt the 'profile' methods of boundary-layer theory to study various flame scenarios, such as contact of semi-infinite burnt and unburnt gas masses, contact with an adiabatic catalyst, and immersion of finite slabs in large gas masses. The methods provide accurate results and are relevant to steady-state flames as well.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
