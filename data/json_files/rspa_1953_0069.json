They found that the exchange reaction occurs through two mechanisms, producing different compounds. The energies of activation and frequency factors for the reactions were determined, and the results showed that tungsten and palladium have lower activation energies compared to other metals. The authors also discussed the effect of inhibiting gas on the frequency factor of a catalytic reaction and the catalytic activity of iron films for this reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
