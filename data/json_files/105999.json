De Luc's method for measuring heights using a barometer and thermometer, which is more accurate than previous methods. The technique involves using a syphon-barometer, correcting for temperature changes, and accounting for the density of air and quicksilver. This method allows for determining heights with an error of 10-15 feet, making it a valuable tool for altitude measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
