They discovered that light exposure reduces the amount of diastase in plants, suggesting that it may play a role in protecting the plant from damage caused by light. This research provides insight into the complex relationship between light and plant growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
