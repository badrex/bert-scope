Savory, examines the structure of red blood corpuscles in oviparous vertebrates and concludes that they are structureless and without a nucleus when alive. The appearance of a nucleus after death is due to changes in the corpuscle and the surrounding blood. The study also highlights the importance of quick and careful examination methods to observe the cells accurately.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
