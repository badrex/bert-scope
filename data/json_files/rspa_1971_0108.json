They found that the stiffness of the interface depends on the linear dimension of the contact, rather than its area. This technique can be used for non-metal materials and is less affected by surface oxide films. The study confirms that the true area of contact is determined by the geometry of the surfaces and the way the asperities are deformed.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
