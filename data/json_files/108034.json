The study also explores the influence of atmospheric pressure on tide heights, finding a correlation between low barometer readings and high tides. The author suggests further research into the effects of wind and atmospheric pressure on tides.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
