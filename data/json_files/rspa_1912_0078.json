They used two methods to measure the number of particles and found that radium B emits slightly more than one beta particle, while radium C emits slightly more than half a beta particle on average. This research helped improve the understanding of radioactive decay and the properties of beta particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
