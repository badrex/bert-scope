He discovered that the notches in a razor can tear out hair at the root, causing pain during shaving. He also studied the muscles of a codfish and found that their particles are even smaller than human hair, revealing the complexity of their composition. This research helped him understand the limitations of razors and the intricacies of muscle structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microscopy and Histology"}
