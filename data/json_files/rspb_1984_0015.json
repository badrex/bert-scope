The researchers discovered two through-conducting systems: a nerve net and a slow conduction system. They also found a 'local conduction system' in the tentacles and oral disc, which plays a crucial role in controlling local, asymmetrical parts of the feeding behavior. This local conduction system allows the radial spread of excitation from tentacle to mouth or mouth to tentacle, but does not allow excitation to spread around the oral disc."}
