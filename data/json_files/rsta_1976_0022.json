The model examines the influence of various parameters on the direction of rotation of the current field and force surface, focusing on the equilibrium tide and its response to different tidal constituents. The study is relevant to understanding the behavior of tides in bodies of water like lakes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
