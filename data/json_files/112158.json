The author, Benjamin Ward Richardson, conducted experiments using various methods to suspend animation, such as chloroform, carbonic acid, and drowning. He analyzed the experimental evidence and concluded that the process of restoring life is similar to relighting a taper, with the animal body's combustion being the source of life. Richardson discusses three natural steps in the inquiry: fanning the animal fire, introducing new blood, and understanding the affinity of oxygen for combustible substances in the blood. He also explores artificial respiration, circulation, and the effects of temperature on the body in his experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Physiology"}
