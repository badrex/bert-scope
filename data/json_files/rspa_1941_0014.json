They find that exchange can be very important and may help resolve discrepancies between theory and experiment for other elements. The results can be used to determine interstellar electron densities and improve our understanding of stellar atmospheres and ionized layers in the Earth's upper atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
