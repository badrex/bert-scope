They found that the affinity and heat of intercalation for nitrogen were considerably higher than for argon. The crystals behaved as energetically homogeneous sorbents for certain cationic forms. The study provides insights into the role of dispersion, repulsion, polarization, and quadrupole interactions in the sorption process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Zeolites and Catalysis"}
