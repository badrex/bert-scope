The analysis confirmed the tuatara's primitive status and suggested that monotremes are the sister-group of birds, while squamates form the sister-group of a bird + monotreme assemblage. The study also indicated that the tuatara has a close relationship with turtles, making it the most primitive amniote except for chelonia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
