They develop a method to express a Fourier superposition of plane waves as a linear superposition of cylindrical waves and analyze the singular behavior of the linear operator in each case. This work has applications in scattering theory and the analysis of small surface defects.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
