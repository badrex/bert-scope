The author, Thomas Hornsby, analyzes the observations made by various astronomers and concludes that the uncertainty in the Sun's parallax has been resolved. He calculates the mean parallax to be 8.78 arcseconds, which leads to a mean distance of the Earth from the Sun of 93,726,900 English miles. This research helps to confirm the accuracy of previous observations and provides a better understanding of the Solar System's dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
