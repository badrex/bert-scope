He describes his methods for observing these phenomena, including using microscopes and copper plates. His findings challenge previous understandings of sugar's structure and reveal new insights into the circulation of blood in eels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microscopy and Crystallography"}
