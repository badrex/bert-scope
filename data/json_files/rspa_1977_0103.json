The authors use mass spectrometry to analyze ion abundances and determine the rate constants for the reactions involved. The results provide insights into the processes of electron attachment and detachment in flames, which can be useful for reducing electron density in rocket exhaust plumes and improving combustion systems for electricity generation."}
