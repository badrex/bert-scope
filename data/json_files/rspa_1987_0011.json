The authors focus on the dominant contribution from Bragg-Compton double scattering events and explore the effects of incident beam energy, sample thickness, orientation, crystal structure, and atomic number on multiple scattering. They propose ways to reduce or overcome the challenges posed by multiple scattering in experimental work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
