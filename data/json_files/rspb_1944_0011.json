It shows that estrogen can prevent the rapid fall in ovary weight and stimulate the proliferation of the membrana granulosa, leading to an increase in the number of larger follicles. The results suggest that estrogen may play a role in ovarian development and function, even in the absence of the pituitary gland.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
