Darbishire and J.B. Farmer to study the effect of ancestral contributions on heredity in plants. They crossed different varieties of yellow peas with an extracted green pea and observed the proportion of yellow and green seeds in the offspring. The results showed that the proportion of green seeds remained consistent, regardless of the distribution of characters in the parent plants, supporting the theory of ancestral contributions in heredity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
