They used a microcalorimetric bead technique to measure reaction rates and temperatures. The results showed that palladium is more active for the oxidation of higher alkanes and cycloalkanes. The oxidation process involves the interaction of hydrocarbon from the gas phase with palladium oxide, followed by the rapid desorption of carbon dioxide and the slower desorption of water. However, the catalyst's activity is inhibited by large concentrations of water vapor, which may form palladium hydroxide.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
