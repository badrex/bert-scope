The author examines apospory in ferns, describing its cellular features and the conditions required for its occurrence. They also discuss the absence of sporangia or sorus in the plants studied and the role of prothalli in aposporous growth. The article highlights the similarities between apospory and apogamy and suggests that there is no reduction in chromosome count during the transition from sporophyte to gametophyte generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
