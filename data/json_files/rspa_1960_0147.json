The study investigates the thermal and magnetic properties of these alloys, providing insights into their phase diagrams and the behavior of their constituents. The findings contribute to the understanding of the relationship between the number of holes in the d-band of transition elements and their properties upon alloying.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Alloy Chemistry"}
