They also show that under certain assumptions, the equality of matter and charge densities and the relation between them can be deduced from the field equations. The study has implications for understanding the behavior of charged dust in equilibrium and the field in empty space outside charged dust distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
