The research found that the effects of subsonic and supersonic aircraft emissions were not linearly additive, and the optimum latitude for operating a one-dimensional model was recommended for the Northern Hemisphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
