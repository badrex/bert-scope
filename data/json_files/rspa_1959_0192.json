This shell model accounts for the frequency-wave number relations of germanium's normal modes of vibration with only two disposable parameters, providing a better explanation for the elastic constants' behavior. The model also gives the atom the property of polarizability, which helps to understand the lattice vibrations and induced electric fields in the crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
