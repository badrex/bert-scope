The authors discuss the correlation between the chemistry and crystallography of these materials, as well as the progression from tetragonal to orthorhombic symmetry. They also examine the ordered structure of these materials and the presence of defects in their formation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science"}
