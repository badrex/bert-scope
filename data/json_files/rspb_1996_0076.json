Both point localization and line orientation exhibit high performance in the hyperacuity range and are considered as primitives with their own neural processing mechanisms. The research shows that there can be perceptual dissonances or visual illusions when these mechanisms do not always operate similarly.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Perception"}
