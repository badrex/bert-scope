Winn's Observations of Lightning on a Conductor on a Ship", "semantic_tags": ["Lightning", "Conductor", "Electrical discharge", "Ship safety", "Benjamin Franklin"], "tldr": "Capt. J.L. Winn describes his observations of lightning appearing on a conductor fixed on a ship's mast. He noticed a pale bluish light and sparks coming from the conductor, which he confirmed as the source after covering the binnacle with his cloak. The chain conductor broke during the incident, but luckily, it did not fall into the water or separate beyond the attracting distance. This observation contributes to the understanding of lightning and its effects on ships, building on Benjamin Franklin's work on conductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
