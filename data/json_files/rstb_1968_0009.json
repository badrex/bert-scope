The research explores the influence of visual selection by birds and climatic factors on the snail's color and banding patterns. The findings show that visual selection is consistent with the overall distribution of morph frequencies, while climatic factors, such as local temperature, may also play a role in the snail's variation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
