They use bispherical coordinates and the method of separation of variables to solve Laplace's equation, providing a more accurate solution than numerical relaxation techniques. This solution can help improve the design of electrostatic lenses in particle accelerators and other applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical and Electronics Engineering"}
