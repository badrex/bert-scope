It demonstrates that a chemical substance produced by mature males can accelerate the maturation of young locusts. The substance is released through olfaction and contact, and its presence is indicated by a vibration reaction. The corpora allata, endocrine glands in males, control sexual maturation and related processes, such as the production of the accelerating substance and color change.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
