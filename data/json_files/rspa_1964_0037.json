They found that the decomposition process involves the formation of an intermediate and is dependent on the nature of the bonding between the metal atom and the cyanamide radical. The study also examined the decomposition of sodium, thallous, and lead cyanamides, providing a basis for comparing their thermal stability and structural properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
