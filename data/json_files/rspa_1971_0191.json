They found that the equilibrium constants for tight and loose pairs are independent of the solvent, while the dissociation constants are affected by the solvent's nature. The authors investigated two systems, sodium biphenylide and naphthalenide, and their respective parent hydrocarbons, and sodium naphthalenide and triphenylenide, over a wide temperature range in three solvents. Their experimental and mathematical approach can be applied to both electron-transfer and acid-base equilibria.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
