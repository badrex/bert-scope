These experiments used rocket-grenades to study wind and temperature structures in the upper atmosphere. The authors explain the method and instrumentation of the experiments, and present results from the first four successful firings. The data collected helped determine wind speed and temperature from the speed of sound, and provided pressure and density profiles that closely matched the COSPAR International Reference Atmosphere, 1961.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
