They investigated the pyrolysis of bromobenzene, 1-bromonaphthalene, 2-bromonaphthalene, 9-bromophenanthrene, and 9-bromoanthracene. The results showed that the primary and rate-determining step of the pyrolysis was the C-Br bond dissociation. The authors determined the activation energies and frequency factors for the unimolecular decompositions and discussed the effect of molecular structure on the C-Br bond dissociation energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
