The authors develop a theory applicable to ions and atoms with velocities lower than the orbital electrons of the atoms they collide with, providing a detailed analysis of the impact of two atoms and the cross-section for excitation of the state of the system by the impact.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
