The degradation of the polymer results in molecular weight changes, which are followed by viscosity, osmotic pressure, and ultracentrifuge measurements. The photochemistry of aldehydes and ketones has been extensively studied, and this research contributes to understanding the photodegradation of polymers and their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer chemistry"}
