They prepared the films using thermal evaporation and examined their structures using electron diffraction and microscopy. The results showed that the Faraday effect in these films was significant, with specific rotations ranging from 79,000 to 97,000 degrees per centimeter. This research contributes to the understanding of the properties of ferromagnetic materials and the potential applications of nickel films.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
