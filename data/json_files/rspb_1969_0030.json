It explores host varietal differences, resistance to infection, and the role of genes in determining the ability of legumes to form nodules and fix nitrogen. The study also highlights the importance of understanding these processes for improving crop yields and sustainable agriculture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
