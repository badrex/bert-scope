They found that there is a significant net transfer of positive electricity from the earth to the atmosphere, and that most shower-clouds and thunder-clouds observed were bipolar clouds of positive polarity. The results provide insights into the exchange of electricity between the earth and the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
