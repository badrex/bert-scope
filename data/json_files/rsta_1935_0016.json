The authors study the effects of heating the films under controlled conditions and find that many irregularities in previous results are due to uncontrolled heating during film preparation. The research provides information on local variations of structure and reveals alignments of crystalline particles that are characteristic of the supporting surface, which can help explain the weakness of natural crystal lattices.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
