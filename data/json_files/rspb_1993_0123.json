They find that children are more susceptible to the disease when they are younger and more malnourished. However, it remains unclear whether immunity to the disease is always acquired through infection. The study highlights the importance of addressing malnutrition and its impact on the prevalence of parasitic diseases in vulnerable populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
