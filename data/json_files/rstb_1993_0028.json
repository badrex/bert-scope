Chaperonins form stable binary complexes with non-native protein states, preventing aggregation and arresting spontaneous folding. The release of target proteins in a state committed to the native state requires chaperonin-10 and ATP hydrolysis. The mechanisms of chaperonin-facilitated folding vary depending on the target protein, highlighting the complexity and unity of these processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
