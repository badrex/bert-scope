The author develops a mathematical model to simulate the twister's operation, focusing on the action of the storage cylinder, over-run plate, and balloon-control cylinder. The model demonstrates the essential nonlinear nature of the free balloon problem and shows how the yarn balloon controls tension in the thread line.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Textile Engineering"}
