The high-temperature reaction was found to be autocatalytic, involving degenerate chain branching with formaldehyde playing a significant role. The main products of the reaction were carbon monoxide, water, and methane, with minor amounts of other gases and peroxides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
