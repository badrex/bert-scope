They find that phosphine decomposes into phosphorus and hydrogen under the influence of light from a mercury lamp. The rate of decomposition is affected by the presence of hydrogen, which acts as a deactivator of excited mercury atoms. The results suggest that the mechanism of the immediate stretch is different from that of the (3-flow, which is connected with a rotation of crystallites to a final position.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photochemistry"}
