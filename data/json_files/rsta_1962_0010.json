The authors analyze various contributions to the crystal potential and discuss the symmetry properties of the lattice. They determine the Fermi energy and describe the shape, dimensions, and topological properties of the Fermi surface. This study provides a solid foundation for interpreting experimental data on the electronic structure of magnesium."}
