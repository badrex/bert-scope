They found that the bacterium was present in the diseased hair and that treating the skin with a method to destroy bacteria could arrest the disease's progress. This finding suggests that bacterial infection may play a role in alopecia areata.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Bacteriology"}
