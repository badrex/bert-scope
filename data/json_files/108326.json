They discovered that the kidneys excrete a significant amount of sulfur and phosphorus in an unoxidized state. The author also found that in cases of diabetes, the amount of unoxidized sulfur in urine is higher than in healthy individuals. Further research is needed to determine the compounds containing these elements in urine.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Metabolism"}
