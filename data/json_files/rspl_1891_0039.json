B. Macallum and Dr. H. Newell Martin, conducted experiments to demonstrate the presence of iron in chromatin using microchemical methods. They found that chromatin in various cells contains iron, which is bound to a protein called nuclein. This discovery expanded the understanding of iron distribution and its role in cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
