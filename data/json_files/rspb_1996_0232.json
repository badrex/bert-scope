Female zebra finches given a high-quality diet before pairing produced larger eggs, larger clutches, had higher hatching success, and fledged more young. The research highlights the importance of nutritional factors in clutch determination and female fitness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ornithology"}
