He found that when potassium reacts with ammonia, a part of the ammonia disappears, and a quantity of hydrogen is evolved. The results suggest that a decomposition of nitrogen has been effected, and further research is needed to understand the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
