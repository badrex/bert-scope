They found that fowls could be infected by the bites of laboratory-bred and laboratory-infected Glossina palpalis, but they were unable to transmit the virus to clean laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis. This suggests that domestic fowls may not play a significant role in the transmission of sleeping sickness.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology and Disease Control"}
