They found that mercury increases the ratio of resting to moving components in the hydrogen spectrum, indicating a decrease in the proportion of the hydrogen spectrum excited by neutralization of protons at the cathode. The authors also observed differences in the behavior of mercury on aluminum and nickel electrodes, with aluminum electrodes showing a stronger mercury spectrum at lower partial pressures of free mercury vapor.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
