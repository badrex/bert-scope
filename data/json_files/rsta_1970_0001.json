The authors analyze the behavior of lubricants under extreme conditions, such as high pressures, temperatures, and shear rates, which are typical in heavily loaded bearing surfaces. They explore the connection between frictional traction and the viscoelastic properties of lubricants, using a new model of a viscoelastic liquid to explain the experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Tribology"}
