F. Baxter conducted experiments to determine if any electrical currents were present during the lacteal absorption process in living animals. Using a galvanometer, Baxter found that the chyle, or lymphatic fluid, had a positive charge, indicating the presence of a current during absorption.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
