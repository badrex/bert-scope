They found that increasing pressure to 70 atmospheres had no mechanical effect on the blood circulation. However, when decompressing, gas bubbles formed in the blood vessels, causing impaired circulation and convulsions. This research suggests that rapid pressure changes can lead to gas embolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
