They found that the simple Mendelian theory cannot explain the inheritance of these colors, as the chance of getting a chestnut foal from a chestnut mare varies among different sires. The author suggests that the inheritance of coat color in horses can be better explained using Galton's hypothesis of dominance.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
