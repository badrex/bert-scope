It explains how Rubisco adjusts photosynthesis according to the concentration of carbon dioxide and how it can either limit or regulate the rate of photosynthesis. The article also explores the effects of Rubisco regulation on the pool size of ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate (RuBP) and the relationship between Rubisco activity and the rate of electron transport in photosynthesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
