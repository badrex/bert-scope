Pertussis toxin increases inward current and membrane conductance, while cholera toxin blocks light responses and induces an outward current and decrease in membrane conductance. The results suggest that the G-protein linked to the cGMP cascade in on-bipolar cells may have structural homology with transducin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
