They used a delicate pressure gauge designed by Professor A. P. Chattock and Mr. J. D. Fry to measure the pressure and velocity of the fluid. The results showed that the critical velocity occurs when the mean velocity is about 4 per second, and above this point, the velocities increase with an increasing discharge.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
