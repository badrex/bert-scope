The researchers found that while normal animals deprived of binocular visual experience still developed a pattern of intertectal connexions that approximated the normal pattern, visual experience may play a role in refining the organization of these connexions. The results suggest that visual function is necessary for the reorganization of intertectal connexions that occurs after larval eye rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
