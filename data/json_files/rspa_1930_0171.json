The authors propose that the luminescent center consists of a definite number of solvent molecules associated with one molecule of the activator. They develop a theory and provide experimental evidence to support their findings, which can help explain the existence of an optimum concentration for luminescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Material Science"}
