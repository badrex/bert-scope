The authors discuss the effects of the valence electrons on the atomic core and the perturbation of the core by the valence electrons. They also compare their results with the Thomas-Fermi field and highlight the challenges of applying the self-consistent field method to heavy elements like Hg.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
