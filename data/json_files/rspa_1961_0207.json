They discovered that the initial alcohol-oxygen ratio and temperature have little effect on the early stages of reaction, mainly affecting the extent of further oxidation of primary products. The study provides insights into the reaction mechanisms and the role of different products in the oxidation process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
