The authors developed a calorimetric bomb and a detonator to measure the heat of detonation and analyze the gases produced. They found that the heat of detonation varies greatly with changes in conditions, and the composition of the gases depends on the density of the explosive and the type of detonator used.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemistry of explosives"}
