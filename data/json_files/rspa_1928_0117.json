They found that the structure of the germanium spectrum is in agreement with theoretical predictions based on the Periodic Table and quantum mechanics. The study provides a deeper understanding of germanium's atomic structure and its place in the periodic table.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Physics"}
