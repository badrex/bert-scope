The authors discovered two distinct ignition systems, with the lower system developing at higher initial pressures in the temperature range where cool flames are typically observed. They also found a new phenomenon of green flames propagating between 330-365\u00b0C, which is unique to ether-air mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Combustion and Flame"}
