The authors found that slip bands form and grow with increasing strain, and that slip occurs on multiple crystallographic planes. At higher temperatures, slip bands are less well-defined. The results have implications for understanding the mechanical behavior of silicon iron and other materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography and Deformation Mechanisms"}
