The main conclusions are that echidnas have the lowest level of warm-blooded animals, while ornithorhyncus has a fairly constant body temperature. Marsupials show evidence of utilizing variations in heat loss to a greater extent than ornithorhyncus but less than higher mammals. The paper also discusses the evolution of warm-blooded animals and their mechanisms for varying heat production and loss.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
