It shows that elements of the -matrix, formed by using appropriately chosen expansion functions, are precisely the coefficients of a representation of the Green function in terms of these same expansion functions. The linear independence of these functions and the invertibility of several infinite-dimensional matrices and their finite-dimensional approximations are crucial to the -matrix approach.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Linear Algebra and Functional Analysis"}
