The study involved analyzing 1325 oriented samples collected from various terranes, including the Lhasa Terrane, Qiangtang Terrane, and Kunlun Terrane. The findings suggest that these terranes may have accreted to Eurasia and remained in a southern position until the convergence of India drove them northward through tectonic shortening and/or displacement of continental crust.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
