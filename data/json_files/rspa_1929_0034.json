The authors studied the distribution of ozone in cyclones and anticyclones using spectroscopy and found that ozone is situated at an average height of about 40 to 50 km. They also addressed various criticisms and factors affecting the accuracy of their observations, such as solar radiation, exposure length, photographic plates, and haze.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
