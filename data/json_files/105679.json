Watson explains that lightning accumulates in the masts and can cause significant damage to the ship. By connecting a wire to the masts and grounding it in the sea, the lightning can be safely discharged, preventing damage. This method has been successful in protecting buildings and cities from lightning strikes, and Watson believes it can be equally effective for ships.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
