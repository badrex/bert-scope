They found that stimulation of the cerebellar cortex inhibits ipsilateral antigravity muscles and augments contralateral antigravity muscles. The cerebellar effect is an inhibitory recruitment, and the inhibition has a longer latency and shorter duration than the excitation of the motor cortex. The study provides insights into the complex motor control mechanisms of the cerebellum and its role in regulating muscle tone and posture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
