They express the Coriolis contribution to the rotatory ether drag coefficient through the Faraday effect constant and find that it has a value approximately equal to the dispersion term but with the opposite sign. This additional term, which they believe is the last one to be considered, is due to the Coriolis force acting on electrons in a rotating coordinate frame, which imitates an equivalent magnetic field. This results in an additional contribution to the rotating ether drag, which has been overlooked in previous theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
