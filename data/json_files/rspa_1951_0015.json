They discovered that polypeptides can exist in a folded (a) and an extended (P) configuration. The findings on the a-form are consistent with the presence of a twofold screw axis in symmetrical polypeptides, leading to a value of about 5.5 \u00c5 for the true fiber repeat distance. The transformation between the a and P forms is influenced by the medium from which the peptide is regenerated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
