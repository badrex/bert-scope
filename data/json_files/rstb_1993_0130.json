CD4 and CD8 proteins function as coreceptors with the T cell receptor in binding MHC class II or class I molecules, respectively. The interactions of CD4 with MHC class II molecules, T cell receptors, and p56 are crucial for the function of CD4 in the immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Immunology > T cell receptors and MHC class II molecules"}
