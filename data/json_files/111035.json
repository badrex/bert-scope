De la Rive's theory on the physical explanation of the causes that produce the diurnal variation of magnetic declination. The author points out that De la Rive's theory fails to accurately represent the facts it claims to explain and is inconsistent with the phenomena observed at St. Helena and the Cape of Good Hope. The author suggests that the observed phenomena may be related to proximity to the line of least magnetic force, which separates the northern and southern magnetic hemispheres."}
