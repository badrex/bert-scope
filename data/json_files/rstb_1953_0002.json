They discovered that melanocytes are highly branched cells that lie in the basal layer of the epidermis and are responsible for skin pigmentation. The authors argue that the branched cells in the superficial layers of the epidermis are effete melanocytes that participate in the outward movement of epidermal cells and are eventually shed at the skin surface. This conclusion is supported by evidence of their structure, mode of branching, relationship to neighboring cells, position in the epidermis, correspondence of number, and distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
