The authors describe their experimental setup and data-logging system, which enables long integration times to be combined with rapid coverage of a suitable range of electron energy. The results show that the polarization falls rapidly above the threshold, and light from the 2p to 1s transitions is unpolarized at all energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
