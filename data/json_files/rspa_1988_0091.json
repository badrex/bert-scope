They find that these temperatures are much higher than previously assumed, with carbon diffusion being the rate-determining process. The revised theory is confirmed through experiments that produce phase-transformed material as a result of a single rubbing contact.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Metallurgy"}
