The author develops an approach to remedy the deficiencies in the elementary theory of bending, providing accurate predictions of stress and displacement near loading sections. The study compares the results with other recent work on the subject and presents experimental work on mild steel beam specimens, showing good agreement between predicted and experimental stress distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Structural Engineering"}
