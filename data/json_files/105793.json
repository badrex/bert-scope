He explains the process of making phosphorus, its properties, and various experiments conducted with it. The phosphorus can be used to represent celestial objects and can be activated by heat or light exposure. The author also discusses the nature of light and its connection to phosphorus.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
