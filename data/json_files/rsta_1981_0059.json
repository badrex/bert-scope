The author reviews existing coal processing plants and explores the potential benefits of coalplexes, including capital savings, flexibility, and energy conservation. The article also highlights the importance of optimizing coalplexes in the context of energy availability and use, and suggests a possibly significant role for synthesis gas in these systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
