The research analyzes the skeletal and soft structures of various sea-star species, including the extinct Oegophiurida, to understand their relationships and the development of key features such as growth gradients, tube-feet, and ampullae. The findings suggest that all star-shaped echinoderms, or Asterozoa, are part of a single phylogenetic stock and are related to pinnulate pelmatozoans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinodermata"}
