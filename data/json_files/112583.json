They introduced the oxalyl radical, which exists in nearly every known organic acid, and explained its connection to cyanogen. The authors classified lactic acids into eight divisions based on their general formula and structure, and demonstrated how these acids relate to the acetic and acrylic series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
