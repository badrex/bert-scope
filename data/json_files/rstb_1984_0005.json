The author explores the effects of hydrostatic pressure on the central nervous system, the mechanisms of adaptation and acclimation to high pressure, and the potential for genetic factors in the evolution of deep-sea animals. The article also examines the relationship between pressure and temperature in affecting biological processes and the potential for pressure acclimation in mammals."}
