Sextactic points are points on a curve where a sixth consecutive point lies on a specific conic. The author provides a detailed analysis of the equations and their applications, contributing to the understanding of the geometry and properties of plane curves.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
