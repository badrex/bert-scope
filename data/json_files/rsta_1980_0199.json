They found that most metal particles were in the 10 pm size range and had compositions in the low Ni-low Co range. No high Co metal particles were encountered. The study provides insights into the composition of lunar soil and its potential relation to meteoritic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
