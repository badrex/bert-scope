They found that the classical eddy current theory underestimates the measured losses, especially at low frequencies. The results agree with the predictions of a domain theory that considers the spread of domain wall restoring forces in iron. This research contributes to understanding the behavior of ferromagnetic materials in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
