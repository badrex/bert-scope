This representation involves a parabolic cylinder function and allows for the evaluation of the integral for complex values of its variables. The asymptotic behavior of the integral is analyzed for large values of the variables, providing insights into its properties and potential applications in mathematical physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Complex Analysis"}
