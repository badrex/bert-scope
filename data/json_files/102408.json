The insects were particularly problematic due to their large numbers, aggressive behavior, and ability to reproduce rapidly. Molyneux also observed that certain environmental factors, such as weather conditions and smoke, could help control the insect populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Entomology"}
