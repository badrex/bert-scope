They discovered that the ionosphere exhibits both rapid and slow changes in direction, which they attribute to large-scale, random tilts in the ionosphere. These tilts affect the accuracy of high-frequency direction finding and can be caused by wave interference within the downcoming radio waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Physics"}
