The authors conducted experiments using differential and density gradient centrifugation techniques to study the composition of these particles. They found that the ATP concentrations, relative to catecholamines, are different in splenic nerve storage particles compared to adrenal chromaffin granules. This may indicate that ATP does not play a significant role in the binding of noradrenaline within the storage particles of sympathetic nerves. The authors also discovered a bimodal distribution of noradrenaline in splenic nerve terminals, which has implications for understanding the relationship between axonal and terminal noradrenaline-containing particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
