They discovered that monofunctional and bifunctional compounds caused different inactivation patterns, with monofunctional compounds breaking down more rapidly. The results provide insights into the biological response to alkylating agents and their potential relevance to cancer research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
