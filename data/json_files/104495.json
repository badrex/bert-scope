He found that the specific gravity of East India diamonds was very close to that of Brazilian diamonds and that the differences between them were not as significant as previously thought. Ellicot also discussed the possible sources of error in the experiments, such as the quality and temperature of the water used, and concluded that the results were accurate and reliable.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
