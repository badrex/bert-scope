They analyze the effects of the tunnel walls on the aerofoil's performance and provide methods to minimize errors. The study focuses on the interference experienced by an aerofoil in an elliptic tunnel, with the goal of improving wind tunnel design and aerodynamic testing.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
