They found that sodium isovalerate behaves as a completely fluid melt above 260\u00b0C, while molten sodium w-butyrate remains fluid throughout its entire mesophase range. The test provides insights into the mechanical properties and fluidity of these organic salts, which have complex melting mechanisms and unique characteristics.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Fluid dynamics"}
