They found that the flutings were produced by a compound of titanium with oxygen, and not by the metal itself. This discovery provided evidence of the presence of oxygen in Antarian stars and indicated that the source of the fluted absorption in these stars is at a temperature low enough to form chemical compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
