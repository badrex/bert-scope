They discovered that the primitive aortae are paired trunks that differentiate into the systemic aorta, the ventral part of the aortic arch, and the iliac and hypogastric arteries. This research provides a detailed understanding of the development and morphology of the vascular system in mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
