They found that the energy release occurs in a single peak, which corresponds to recrystallization. The energy release is accompanied by changes in hardness, electrical resistivity, and density. The results suggest that the release of energy prior to recrystallization in nickel and arsenical copper is due to the rearrangement and annihilation of dislocations and the disappearance of vacancies produced during deformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Metal Annealing"}
