The author compares different experiments and suggests that further research is needed with a more pure and homogeneous form of beryllium to determine its atomic weight accurately. The author also debates the classification of beryllium within the periodic table.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Weight and Periodic Table"}
