The authors found that water immersion causes resin swelling and shrinkage, which weakens the bond between the resin and glass fibers. The use of coupling agents improves the bond life, but debonding still occurs in hot water due to osmotic pressure, interfacial shear stresses, and resin shrinkage. The findings highlight the importance of understanding and mitigating water damage in these materials for their practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
