Mutations in these genes can lead to \"undead\" cells that survive and are incorporated into the adult organism without any negative consequences. The study examines the nature of these undead cells, their similarities and differences, and their potential to replace functioning neurons in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
