The author, Karl Pearson, introduces the concept of frequency curves and their importance in understanding the variation and evolution of species. He also presents a method for dissecting abnormal frequency curves into components, which can help estimate the number of contributing factors and the odds of an element's persistence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
