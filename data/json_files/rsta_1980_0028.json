The author emphasizes the use of Doppler tracking for surveying and highlights the importance of a global, Earth-fixed, geocentric coordinate system for accurate positioning. The article also contrasts the basic elements of traditional surveying techniques and Doppler techniques, and explains the need to consider the geopotential model as part of the Doppler datum definition.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Satellite Navigation"}
