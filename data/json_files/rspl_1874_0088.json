They discovered that injecting defibrinated arterial blood into the portal system of a dog led to a significant increase in sugar levels in the urine. This finding supports the idea that oxygenated blood plays a role in the transformation of amyloid substance into sugar in the liver.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
