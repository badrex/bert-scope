The author highlights discrepancies between laboratory measurements and ionospheric conditions, suggesting that the earth's magnetic field may play a role in the discrepancies. The article also explores the possibility of a satisfactory theory based on a different form of the interaction equation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
