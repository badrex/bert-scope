They discovered that the motion of solids in a rotating fluid differs from that in a fluid at rest, with spheres and cylinders being deflected in a predictable manner. The author also verified theoretical predictions about the motion of vortex rings in rotating fluids, finding that they move in a curved path opposite to the direction of rotation. These findings provide insights into fluid dynamics and the behavior of rotating liquids.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
