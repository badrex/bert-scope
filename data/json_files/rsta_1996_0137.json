The authors develop a weak shock theory and consider various practical examples, such as dredged river sections, sediment slug propagation, and the effects of sediment blocking and extraction. The study provides a comprehensive understanding of the flow dynamics and helps in addressing problems related to floods, droughts, and environmental damage caused by pollutants transported along river beds.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydraulics and River Dynamics"}
