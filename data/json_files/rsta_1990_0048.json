The analysis reveals the influence of climate on vegetation and the impact of human activities on the environment. The study provides evidence of temperature variations, the expansion of different plant species, and the effects of human actions such as agriculture, deforestation, and land use changes on the Mediterranean ecosystem.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Paleoclimatology"}
