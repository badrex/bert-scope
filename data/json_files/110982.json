The author collects data from various navigators and observes that the tides in the central Pacific are too small and anomalous to trace their connection. The diurnal inequality, which is the difference between the two tides of the same day, is found to be significant in the North Pacific and Indian seas, affecting the tidal patterns and causing confusion in estimating the \"establishment\" of a place.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
