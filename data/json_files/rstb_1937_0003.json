The research describes the differentiation of the inner layer and the formation of the coelomic cavities in the head, thorax, and abdomen. The development of various organs and the role of the mesoderm in the formation of blood cells are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
