The results show that although chick size has the strongest effect on proximity, hunger level also plays a role. When chick position is controlled, parents respond to other cues, such as posturing and calling behaviors, when allocating food.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
