They found that bacteria appeared in sealed flasks containing organic infusions, and discussed the importance of understanding the life-history and life-conditions of these organisms before considering the hypothesis of spontaneous generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
