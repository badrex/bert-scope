They discovered that different cell components, such as the nucleus, osmiophilic platelets, plastidome, pseudo-chondriome, and vacuome, have different specific gravities and are displaced accordingly. This research helps to clarify the structure and components of plant cytoplasm.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
