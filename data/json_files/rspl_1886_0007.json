The body exhibits characteristics of both peptones and albumoses, suggesting a unique classification within these groups. The study contributes to the understanding of nitrogenous metabolism in plants and the identification of proteid bodies circulating in plant latex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
