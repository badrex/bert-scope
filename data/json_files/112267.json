He also discusses the role of barometric elevation in creating dispersion of descending currents and the appearance of a calm center with radial currents. Galton suggests that polar cyclones would have a direct rotation, and that the existence of an intermediate area of direct rotation would make the movements of the entire system correlative and harmonious.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
