They found that the visual brightness of the corona varied within relatively narrow limits and that the actual brightness of the corona was probably not very different from the previous eclipse in 1886. The haze and opalescence in the air contributed to the sky illumination during the eclipse.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
