He observes that quicksilver behaves differently in various climates and suggests that changes in atmospheric pressure may affect human health. Lister also explores the role of temperature in the behavior of liquids and solids, and how this might relate to the healthfulness of different seasons.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
