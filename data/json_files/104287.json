The phenomenon resembled an aurora borealis but was stationary and did not have a nucleus. It extended from Gemini to Leo and lasted about an hour before dimming and separating into two parts. Bevis could not find a similar occurrence afterward, and the phenomenon remains unexplained.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational astronomy"}
