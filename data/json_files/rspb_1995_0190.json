In the field, chimaeras grow rapidly, reach large sizes, and produce many eggs, while in the laboratory, they grow slowly, shrink, and fragment. The phenomenon of resorption, where tissues of one genotype are consumed by the other, occurs mainly in the laboratory environment and not in the field. These findings show the importance of understanding life history patterns in chimaeras to predict their evolution and adaptability.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
