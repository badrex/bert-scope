They found that the reaction is a simple bimolecular process, first-order with respect to both the sulphide and hydroperoxide. The reaction rates vary according to the solvent acidity, and adding stronger acids acts as a catalyst. The oxidant is a cyclic complex between the hydroperoxides and a hydrogen-donating molecule, with oxygen atom transfer promoted by a synchronous hydrogen atom exchange process within the complex. The authors report energies and entropies of activation for the oxidation under various conditions and discuss their significance.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
