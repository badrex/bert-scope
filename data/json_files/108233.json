These corpuscles undergo changes in form and may be involved in the process of blood cell division. The author also discusses the presence of a second form of corpuscles in various animals and their possible connection to the so-called \"lymph-granules.\" The study contributes to the understanding of blood cell morphology and cell biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
