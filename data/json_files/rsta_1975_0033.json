They found that the Rockall Plateau is a microcontinent, isolated during the sea floor spreading evolution of the North Atlantic Ocean. The study revealed a complex stratigraphic and tectonic history, with three distinct phases of sea floor spreading that structurally isolated the Rockall Plateau. The authors discuss the factors that have influenced the geology and geological history of the area, including regional warping, subsidence, and epeirogenesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
