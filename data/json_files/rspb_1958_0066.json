It is found that the acrosome becomes detached from living spermatozoa during passage through the female reproductive tract, allowing the perforatorium to expose and enable the spermatozoon to pass through the zona pellucida. The acrosome's function is likely to be the carriage of hyaluronidase, which helps the spermatozoon pass through the cumulus oophorus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproduction"}
