The authors found that moisture promotes combustion at non-sputtering cathodes and retards combustion at freely sputtering cathodes. The study suggests that moisture's role in combustion is almost entirely subordinated to sputtered metal atoms at freely sputtering cathodes. The findings provide insight into the mechanism of cathodic combustion in moist gas mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
