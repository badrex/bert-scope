The authors demonstrate that ignition occurs when the net branching factor attains a value determined by the sum of two quantities, one proportional to the thermal capacity and the other proportional to the thermal conductivity. The theory explains the effects of vessel diameter, surface condition, temperature, and concentrations of sensitizer, reactants, and foreign gases on the explosion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
