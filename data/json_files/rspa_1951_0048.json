This method, called the equivalent orbital method, can be applied to any saturated molecule with a singlet ground state. It uses ionization potentials rather than total energies and offers a more accurate approximation to molecular orbitals compared to the linear combination of atomic orbitals method. The authors demonstrate the method's application on methane and ethane molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
