The authors investigate the effects of test conditions and variables, and provide a guide for selecting materials based on their erosion resistance. The study aims to help engineers reduce the negative effects of cavitation erosion in hydraulic machinery and steam turbines.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
