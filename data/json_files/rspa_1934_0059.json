They develop the theory on classical lines, without touching the quantum theory, and argue that the new electrodynamics is a consequence of the general principle of invariance. The authors believe that the new field theory can provide a deeper foundation for the understanding of the natural laws and may help explain the existence of elementary particles, nuclear construction, and particle conversions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Field Theory"}
