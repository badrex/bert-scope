The authors found that X-rays have a lethal effect on bacteria, with the mean lethal dose being independent of intensity and temperature. They also discovered that X-rays cause the production of abnormally long bacterial forms, which could have implications for understanding bacterial growth and survival.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
