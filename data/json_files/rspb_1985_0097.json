It explains how variational principles can be used to solve early vision problems and how specific electrical, chemical, or neuronal networks can be derived for tasks like edge detection and visual motion computation.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Computational Methods in Vision"}
