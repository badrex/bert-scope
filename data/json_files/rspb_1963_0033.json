They determined the optimum culture conditions for pigmentation and analyzed the structure of ferroverdin and its degradation products. The study suggests that ferroverdin is the ferrous complex of the p-vinylphenylester of 3-nitroso-4-hydroxybenzoic acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
