Jaques Paul Babin, observed the unusual behavior of the Euripus, a narrow strait in the Aegean Sea, and its connection to the Moon's phases. He found that the water's flow changes its course depending on the Moon's position, with a regular pattern for 20 days each month and irregular patterns for the remaining 10 days. The author also noted the differences between the Euripus and ocean tides, such as the height of the water and the direction of the flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
