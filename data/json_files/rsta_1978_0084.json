The authors develop expressions for important parameters like peak curvature in terms of discrete ordinates and the correlation function. They also introduce a new statistical model of the surface that can be used for various types of engineering surfaces. The study focuses on the effects of sampling interval and uses a three-point model to simplify the measurement of complex parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Surface Analysis and Tribology"}
