The event was followed by a trembling that lasted about 3 seconds and a distant thunder-like noise. Clare initially thought the building near him moved, and a watering pot nearby was knocked over. He later discovered that a brick from the house was thrown off by the shock. This observation might be of interest to the scientific community.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Seismology"}
