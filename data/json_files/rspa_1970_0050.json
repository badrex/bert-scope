The model takes into account the continuous spectrum of obstacle sizes and the role of regelation and creep mechanisms in glacier sliding. The author calculates the drag force, the dependence of drag on scale, and the overburden pressure necessary to suppress cavitation. The theory agrees well with observations of glacier thickness."}
