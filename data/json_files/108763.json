They find that the particle velocity and density of the fluid are connected by an invariable relation, and that there are two types of sound waves: positive waves of condensation and negative waves of rarefaction. The author also discusses the resistance to sound waves in different gases and the formation of bores in sound waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
