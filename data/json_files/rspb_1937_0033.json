They found that both lyo- and desmo-glycogen can induce neural tissue in embryos. The induced neural tissue, however, lacks regional organization and does not form specific body structures. This suggests that the evocator-glycogen complex plays a role in early developmental processes but may not be responsible for the formation of specific body parts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
