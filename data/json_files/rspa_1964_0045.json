Both models have limitations in the zero-order approximation, but they provide a useful classification of spectral bands. The localized-orbital model is better for calculating energies, while the iso-conjugate-hydrocarbon model is more suitable for molecules with partial delocalization of electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
