Acetylcholine and adenosine 5'-triphosphate (ATP) act in opposing ways on these cells via receptors found in different fluid compartments of the organ of Corti. Cholinergic receptors are localized at the basal region of the cells and activate a rapidly desensitizing hyperpolarizing K+ current, while purinergic receptors are found at the apical surface and activate a depolarizing non-selective cation current with inward rectification and no desensitization. These findings suggest that ATP may modulate the mechano-electrical transduction process in the cochlea.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
