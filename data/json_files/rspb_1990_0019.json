They found that the fertilization current, calcium wave, and contraction wave occurred in the same direction and that a region of elevated calcium persisted at the animal pole. These findings provide insights into the early events of fertilization and development in ascidian eggs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
