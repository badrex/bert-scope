The authors conclude that desensitizers act during exposure by reversing the photochemical reaction, and they provide experimental evidence supporting this theory. They also discuss the role of desensitizers in emulsion-making and the potential for catalytic action in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photographic Chemistry"}
