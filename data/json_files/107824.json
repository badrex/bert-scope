The author explores the effects of gravity and temperature on vapor tension, and introduces the force of homogeneous attraction as a factor in condensing vapors. The author also provides examples of experiments with camphor and crystallization to illustrate these concepts.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
