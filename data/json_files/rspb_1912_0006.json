The authors found that waterbuck, bushbuck, and reedbuck can be infected with a human strain of the parasite, and that laboratory-bred Glossina palpalis flies can transmit the virus to susceptible animals. The study also shows that antelopes can remain infected for a year and that a duiker, another species of antelope, can also be infected with the same strain of T. gambiense.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
