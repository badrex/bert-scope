They found that the magnetic susceptibility follows Curie's law, and the specific heat is mainly due to magnetic interactions between ions. The spin-lattice relaxation time is shorter than in most other paramagnetics, which explains the failure to detect relaxation in earlier experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
