They show that Wolbachia can easily be lost from populations and discuss possible tests of this model. The study also highlights the complex mesh of unidirectional and bidirectional incompatibility in mosquitoes, which does not simply correspond to the presence or absence of Wolbachia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
