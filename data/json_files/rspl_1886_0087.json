They found that there is a definite relation between the two, which can be used to improve astronomical observations and measurements. This research also highlights the importance of considering factors such as exposure time, altitude, and the chemical composition of the photographic film in obtaining accurate results.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophotography"}
