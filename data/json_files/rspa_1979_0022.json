The research compares different methods of sound velocity measurements and finds that acoustic thermometry provides two independent cross-checks on gas thermometry. The results are in agreement with the recent gas thermometry of Berry (1978) if the \"old\" value of the gas constant is used, but disagree with the recent value of Quinn, Colclough, and Chandler (1976). The study concludes that the gas constant should be based on Batuecas's value, and the results are quoted in terms of Kelvin to facilitate recalculations as new information on the gas constant becomes available.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
