They found that the amount of unfolding during alpha-beta transformation can be determined by measuring the maximum reversible extension. The results showed that these proteins have varying behaviors, with some showing perfect elasticity, while others exhibit internal slipping and supercontraction. The study provides insights into the structure and properties of fibrous proteins, which can help in understanding their functions and potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
