They introduce a new definition of the piezoelectric limiting speed and use the piezoelectric interfacial impedance tensor to show that a maximum of two subsonic Stoneley waves can occur. A definite existence criterion for a single subsonic piezoelectric Stoneley mode is given, and a numerical scheme for finding Stoneley modes is presented.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
