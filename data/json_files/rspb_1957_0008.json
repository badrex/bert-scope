The results show that excess vitamin A induces mucous metaplasia in the epidermis, leading to the formation of a mucin-secreting membrane. This transformation is reversible when the explants are transferred to normal medium. The findings provide insights into the role of vitamin A in tissue development and differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
