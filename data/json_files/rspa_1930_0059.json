They used an improved experimental method to measure ion mobilities and found that water vapor causes a significant narrowing of the negative ion band, mainly due to the disappearance of ions with a mobility of 1.5. There is also a shift of the band towards lower mobility values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atmospheric Science"}
