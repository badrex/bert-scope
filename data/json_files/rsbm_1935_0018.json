His work included establishing the density of electric charge near the vertex of a cone, solving the torsion problem in elasticity, and developing Macdonald's theorem. Macdonald's research on elastic waves in crystals and his critique of Maxwell's electromagnetic energy function are among his most notable achievements.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
