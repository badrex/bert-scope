They focus on the facial area and discover precise localization for movements of individual facial parts, even half of the lower lip. They also discuss the specialization of tongue movements and some degree of unilaterality in soft palate and pharynx movements.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
