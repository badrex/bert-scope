The results yield an inverse square law of gravitation with a \"gravitational constant\" proportional to the time reckoned from the natural origin of time. The analysis incorporates the expanding universe and explains the general spiral character of galaxies and certain features of the motions observed in our own galaxy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
