Haemoglobin is found in the blood and eggs of these crustaceans, and its quantity varies greatly depending on factors such as oxygen levels and nutrition. The author also explores the potential role of haemoglobin in parthenogenetic development and its function in Daphnia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
