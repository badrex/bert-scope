The researchers found that these tapeta contain a compound consisting of oligomers of 5,6-dihydroxindole-2-carboxylic acid combined with decarboxylated-adenosylmethionine. The tapetum lies in the retinal pigment epithelium and is enclosed within tapetal spheres. The study also discovered a red pigment in the pigment epithelium of some characins, which is apparently the same as New Zealand parrotfish red pigment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Anatomy"}
