The authors derive an evolution equation for these waves and study its properties, finding that nonlinear effects can either stabilize or destabilize the wave amplitude. The research focuses on a model problem for dispersive waves, considering an incompressible isotropic elastic plate under hydrostatic pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
