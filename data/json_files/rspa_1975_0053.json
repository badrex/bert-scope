The authors develop a non-classical plate theory that accounts for this dependence and apply it to two problems: the static response of an infinite plate on a Winkler foundation and the propagation of plane waves in a system of a liquid layer and a floating ice plate. The results show that the effects of the Poisson ratio's dependence on brine content are negligible for both fresh water ice and sea ice, making it difficult to detect this dependence experimentally.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
