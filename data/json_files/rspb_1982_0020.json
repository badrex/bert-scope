They are involved in intense RNA synthesis, with their structure consisting of chromomeres and lateral loops. Although their functional significance remains a topic of debate, lampbrush chromosomes have contributed to understanding DNA organization and the C-value paradox. They are present in various animal species, including invertebrates and chordates, and are essential for studying oocyte biology and meiosis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
