The authors use perturbation methods to derive expressions for criticality and transition in systems with arbitrary Biot numbers, focusing on the infinite slab, cylinder, and sphere geometries. The study applies to general circumstances and can handle temperature-dependent reaction rates. Numerical results are provided for the important case of Arrhenius kinetics at a transition point.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Heat Transfer and Fluid Dynamics"}
