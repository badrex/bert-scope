They found that the membrane potential varies continuously with the concentration of the system and that the equilibrium membrane potential is determined by the buffer solution. The results provide insights into the chemical nature of the membrane and its influence on the diffusion of ions across it.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
