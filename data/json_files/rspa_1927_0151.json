They found that the crystals' optical activity is due to special arrangements of atoms within their unit cells, rather than pseudo-symmetrical intergrowths of biaxial lamellae. The study provides insights into the true nature of optically active crystals and the role of X-rays in revealing their structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
