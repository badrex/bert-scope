The authors collected samples from crevasses and ice grottoes, and analyzed the samples using optical crystallography to understand the transition of firn into glacier ice and the internal structure of glaciers. They found that glaciers flow like highly viscous fluids, and their findings contribute to the understanding of the internal mechanism of glacier flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Glaciology"}
