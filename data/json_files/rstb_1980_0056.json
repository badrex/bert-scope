They observed the concentrations of various metabolites, such as 2,3-diphosphoglycerate, ATP, and inorganic phosphate, and monitored the transport of small molecules into cells. NMR allowed them to examine the behavior of molecules inside intact cells, providing valuable insights into cellular processes and interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
