They found that 7 Cygni's spectrum is the connecting link between the spectra of Aldebarian stars and a Cygni stars. The study also revealed a close resemblance between the spectrum of 7 Cygni and the chromosphere, indicating similar temperature and electrical conditions. The authors claim that most lines in 7 Cygni's spectrum, and thus the chromosphere, are due to metallic vapours rather than rarer atmospheric gases.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Stellar Spectra"}
