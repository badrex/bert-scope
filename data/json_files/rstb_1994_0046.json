Contrary to expectations, the insect fossil record shows no high extinction rates during this period. The constancy of species and communities of species can be demonstrated for at least the last million years. The author discusses the implications of these findings for estimating present and future extinction rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
