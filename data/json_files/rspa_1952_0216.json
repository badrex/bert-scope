They found that the material behaves as a positive-hole conductor at lower temperatures and as an electron conductor at higher temperatures. The results help to clarify the discrepancies in previous research and provide insights into the behavior of semiconductors under different conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Semiconductors"}
