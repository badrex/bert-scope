The authors found that the stress required to initiate yield increases with a fall in temperature, and the mechanism of deformation changes from normal slip to the formation of Neumann lamellae at a critical temperature. The critical temperature is higher under dynamic load, and the formation of Neumann lamellae plays a role in initiating fractures in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
