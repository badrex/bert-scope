The authors tabulate the spin-orbit interaction matrix elements using group theoretical methods to help assign values to energy levels observed in neodymium salts. They also discuss various Zeeman effects and provide a simple explanation for one feature of the spectrum of neodymium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
