They found that the bacillus was present in some cases but not in all, and its absence in many cases did not support Koch's views on its causal relation to the disease. The authors also discussed the pathology of cholera, the possible role of the comma bacillus in premonitory diarrhea, and their findings on protective inoculations and other related topics.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Epidemiology and Infectious Diseases"}
