They derived distributional properties of various types of sojourn times when a given number of channels are open in a system containing a specified number of independent channels in equilibrium. This research helps in understanding the probabilistic structure of a superposition of single-channel processes, assisting in the analysis of data and extending insights into the link between molecular and macroscopic membrane phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
