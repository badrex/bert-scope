The author found that these insects are attracted to trees with dry and sick barks, which have less moisture and greenness. The insects lay their eggs in the channels, and the hatched larvae create more channels to grow. The author also noticed that the insects are attracted to trees with thick, sweet sap, which is a result of poor tree health. The author suggests that these insects may play a role in the decline of elm and ash trees."}
