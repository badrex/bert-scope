This theory explains the displacement of new leaves without the need for physiological repulsions, as previously suggested. The author also describes the development of axillary buds and seedlings and the asymmetries of leaves in relation to this new interpretation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
