The study finds that sperm size is independent of the risk of sperm competition, and only sperm numbers increase with this risk. The findings challenge previous models that assumed constant and unimportant sperm size in determining fertilization success.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
