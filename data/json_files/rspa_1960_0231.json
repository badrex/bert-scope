The author focuses on viscous flow under a pulsating pressure gradient and finds that the Taylor diffusion coefficient contains terms proportional to the square of the amplitude of the pressure pulsations. However, the coefficients of these terms tend to zero rapidly, and the effect of pulsation rarely contributes more than (the ratio of the amplitude of pressure gradient pulsation to mean pressure gradient)^2 to the total dispersion coefficient.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
