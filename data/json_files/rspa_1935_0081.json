The author uses a general method to calculate the lift coefficient and discusses three cases: a fully laminar boundary layer, a fully turbulent boundary layer, and a boundary layer with both laminar and turbulent portions. The results provide a theoretical determination of the circulation in the irrotational flow past the cylinder, which is essential for understanding the lift coefficient."}
