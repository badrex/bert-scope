Fowler and H. L. Callendar, discovered a new series of lines in the spectrum of magnesium. They found that these lines constituted a regular series associated with the stronger series described by Rydberg. The new series, along with the two well-known subordinate series of triplets, were found in the arc spectrum of magnesium. This discovery added to the understanding of the atomic spectra of elements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
