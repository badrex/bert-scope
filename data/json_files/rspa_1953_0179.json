They found that the space group is P2Ja, and the unit cell contains two planar, centro-symmetric molecules. The structure was refined using double Fourier series methods, revealing variations in carbon-carbon bond lengths. The results showed good agreement with theoretical predictions and provided insights into the arrangement of molecules in the crystal.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
