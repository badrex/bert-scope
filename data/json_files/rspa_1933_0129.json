They identified these ions by determining their mobility in nitrogen gas, showing that the mobility of an ion gives an unambiguous measure of its mass. This method offers a means of determining the mass of positive ions in a gas at high pressures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Mass spectrometry"}
