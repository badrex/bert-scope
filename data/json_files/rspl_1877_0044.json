They used a guarding condenser and an electrometer to compare the capacity of glass samples with that of solid paraffin. The results showed that the quotient of electrostatic capacity and density for these glasses lies between 2.0 and 2.3, and did not support Prof. Maxwell's conclusion about the relationship between refractive index, electrostatic capacity, and magnetic permeability.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrostatics"}
