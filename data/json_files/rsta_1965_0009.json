The study considers a simplified model of a continental shelf, taking into account bottom friction and the Coriolis force. The research applies the theory to storm surges on the west coast of the British Isles, showing that these surges are generated by wind fields associated with moving depressions acting over the sea of the continental shelf south of Ireland. The observed surge at Milford Haven is successfully reproduced using the theory in two cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
