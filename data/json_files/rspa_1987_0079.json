The authors develop a leading-order expression for the reactor's behavior and perform numerical calculations to assess the validity of their analytical results. The findings show that the time-to-ignition follows a universal formula, indicating that the critical point of ignition is a bifurcation point of the limit type.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Chemical Engineering"}
