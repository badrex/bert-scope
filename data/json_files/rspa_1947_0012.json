They discovered that high temperatures, around 480\u00b0C, are necessary for the explosion of nitroglycerine, which can be reached on rubbing surfaces under moderate conditions of load and speed. This provides evidence that frictional hot spots play a significant role in initiating explosive reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
