The authors use stroboscopy to study the modes and frequencies of these oscillations and develop a theory to explain the observed phenomena. They find that surface friction and air drag play a significant role in determining the mode and frequency of oscillations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
