They found that the plastic zone needed to accommodate a given plastic displacement at the root of a notch is about 1000 times larger than the plastic displacement and about five times longer than the notch. The distribution of plastic-elastic strain in the yielded region can be represented by an inverted pile-up of dislocations. This research helps in understanding the problem of notch-brittleness in steel and provides insights into the conditions required for fracture.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics > Plasticity"}
