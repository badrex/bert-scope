They found that the initial compaction of these materials is not governed by the sliding of particles into new equilibrium positions. Sodium chloride compacts through plastic deformation of individual particles, while sucrose and coal compacts through particle fracture. The use of a scanning electron microscope provided detailed insights into the behavior of particles within compacts under applied stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Material Science > Powder Compaction"}
