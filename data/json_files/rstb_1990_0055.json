It explains how bombesin binds to specific receptors on the cell surface, triggering a cascade of molecular events, including the activation of protein kinase C, elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate, and expression of proto-oncogenes c-fos and c-myc. These findings contribute to understanding the molecular mechanisms of cell growth and differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
