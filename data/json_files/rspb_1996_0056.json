The research suggests that the high levels of mitochondrial DNA variation could be due to the population structure of pulmonates, which favors the persistence of ancient haplotypes. This discovery has implications for understanding the genetic variation and evolution of these species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
