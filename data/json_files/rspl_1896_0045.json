They discovered that the eel undergoes a transformation from a Leptocephalus larva to its adult form. The study also provides insights into the reproduction and development of other Muraenoids, as well as the migration patterns of these species in the ocean.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
