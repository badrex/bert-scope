It discusses various physical and chemical processes that occur in shocked gases, including collision-induced dissociation, electron dissociation, and chemical reactions. The article also explores the chemistry of specific regions of the interstellar medium and the importance of molecular observations as a diagnostic probe of shock environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Astrochemistry"}
