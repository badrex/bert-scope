They used a specially designed apparatus to measure the angular distribution of electrons scattered at different energies. The results confirmed the validity of the method and showed that electron exchange effects can be neglected for heavy atoms. This study provides a foundation for further investigations of electron scattering by other metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
