The authors found that certain properties, such as specific heat and heat evolved during mixing, reach a maximum deviation from the mean in mixtures of the same strength. The relationship between these properties is complex and likely interconnected, suggesting a deeper understanding of the underlying mechanisms is needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical chemistry"}
