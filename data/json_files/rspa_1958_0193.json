The wave functions, energy, and initial slope parameters for these atoms are presented with the accuracy justified by the physical approximation. This study is significant for understanding atomic structures and their applications in fields like X-ray crystal analysis, solid-state physics, and optical studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
