The study provides insights into magma generation in the upper mantle and the formation of oceanic lithosphere. The research suggests that crystallization takes place at depths of less than 60 km and that the nature of the basalt erupted depends on the rate of upwelling and crystallization in the diapir.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
