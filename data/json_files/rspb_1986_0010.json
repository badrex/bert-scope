The results show that cord transection is followed by restoration of the ascending dorsal column in a stage-dependent manner. This research provides insights into the restoration of axon pathways in the central nervous system of amphibians and other vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
