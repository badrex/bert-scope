The authors explore the variations in trace element contents and inter-element ratios of deep-sea basalts and their possible causes, such as sampling inadequacy, submarine alteration, and low-grade metamorphism. They also suggest that variations in the trace element contents of mantle material at the levels of basaltic genesis may exist, and that geochemical provinces can be found in oceanic areas, similar to continental regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
