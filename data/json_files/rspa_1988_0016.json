Each storm consists of a circular rain region that moves with random velocity and disappears after a random time. The model helps study the properties of rainfall intensity and provides insights into the covariance function and storm duration at a single site.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Hydrology"}
