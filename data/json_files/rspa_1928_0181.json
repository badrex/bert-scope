They derive an expression for the thermionic current density in the presence of an electric field and discuss the modification of the Schottky effect at high fields. The study shows that the effect of a surface charge is to decrease the thermionic work function, and the potential difference between the surface and the interior of the conductor diminishes as the electric field increases.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
