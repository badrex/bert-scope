The authors use radio-frequency methods to determine the variation of the adiabatic susceptibility and the magnetic specific heat of the enhanced nuclear system. The results are in good agreement with values deduced from optical and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
