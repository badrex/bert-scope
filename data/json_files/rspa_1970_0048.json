The authors determine the rotational constant and -doubling parameters and find evidence for a tensorial interaction between the electron spin and magnetic field. They also observe hyperfine structure from the 77Se isotope and determine the hyperfine coupling constants. Finally, the authors analyze the effect of an electric field on the spectra and determine the electric dipole moment.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Physics"}
