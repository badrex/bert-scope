They demonstrate that the total, kinetic, and potential energies can be obtained to the order from a knowledge of only the -order wave function. They also suggest a combination of variational and perturbation methods as the best approach for calculating small disturbances. The authors apply these methods to various problems and discuss their results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
