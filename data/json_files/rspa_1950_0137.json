The results provide insights into the hydrodynamics of the superfluid component and challenge the concept of a critical velocity in the flow of liquid helium. The findings suggest that the flow of the superfluid component may not be truly frictionless, and there may be small dissipative forces at play.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
