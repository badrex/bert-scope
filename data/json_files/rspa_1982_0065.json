They found nonlinearity in the shear-stress-shear-strain-rate relation when the stress exceeded about 3 MPa, supporting the Eyring theory of viscous flow. This technique allowed them to study the nonlinear properties of fluids at high shear stresses without the influence of viscous heating.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
