He discusses experiments conducted by other scientists and his own, which demonstrate that nitrogen is released during plant growth and that the proportion of nitrogen to oxygen is influenced by sunlight. Rigg also explores the differences in seed germination and plant growth in shaded and sunny conditions, attributing these differences to the influence of nitrogen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
