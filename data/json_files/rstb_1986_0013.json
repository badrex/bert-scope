They found that the giant synapse has a unique structure and is one of the few neuro-neuronal synapses where it is possible to insert microelectrodes into both presynaptic and postsynaptic fibers. The study provides insights into the structure and function of the giant synapse, which has been used for research on the mechanism of transmitter release and the role of various ions in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
