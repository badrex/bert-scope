They explore the mathematical methods and properties of steady motion, symmetrical vibrations, and the formation of hollows within the vortex rings. The research provides insights into fluid dynamics and the behavior of matter in the context of the vortex theory.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
