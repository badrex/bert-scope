They found that rocks at depth possess weak but uniform magnetization, which is crucial for accurate magnetic survey results. The study also discusses the effects of oxidation, weathering, and cross-magnetization on the magnetic properties of rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
