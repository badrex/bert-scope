The author analyzes experiments conducted by Lord Rayleigh and compares them to previous theories, concluding that recombination is responsible for the long duration of the Balmer spectrum. The findings have implications for understanding the luminosity of hydrogen in various environments, such as galactic nebulae and laboratory discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
