The author analyzes the data to understand the annual and diurnal variations in terrestrial magnetism and discusses the impact of secular changes and irregular disturbances on the observations. The findings provide insights into the behavior of the Earth's magnetic field and its variations over time.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
