He explains how the encroachment of the sea and the subsidence of land have led to the dissolution of the islands and the disappearance of ancient inhabitants and their artifacts. Borlase also discusses the possible reasons for these changes, such as the continuous advances of the sea and the shifting of sands, which have exposed ruins and walls.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
