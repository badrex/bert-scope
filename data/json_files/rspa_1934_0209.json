They discovered that the reaction is mainly unimolecular and does not show a significant decrease in the rate of reaction at pressures down to 10 mm. The authors also determined the energy of activation for the reaction and discussed the molecular statistics involved in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
