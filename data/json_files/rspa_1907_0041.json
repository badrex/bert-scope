They observed striking effects of heat and cold on the gold leaves, which were repelled or attracted by hot and cold bodies. The authors also found that thermal radiations could cause significant disturbance of the gold leaves, and constructed a specialized electroscope to further investigate these phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
