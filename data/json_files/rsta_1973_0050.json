The distortion of the Earth's gravitational potential field by the ocean tide has been calculated, accounting for both the elastic deformation of the Earth and the self-potential of the water. The potential field generated by the ocean tide is significant and may have a considerable influence on the tidal motion. The study of Earth tides and ocean tides is crucial for understanding their effects on the Earth's geophysics and oceanography.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
