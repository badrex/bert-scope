They found that some of these compounds have significant antiseptic and trypanocidal activity, with varying degrees of effectiveness and toxicity. The compounds with a dimethylamino group in the benzene nucleus were found to be inactive against trypanosomes, while others showed promising results. The authors also observed that these substances can have a prolonged prophylactic effect due to their persistence in the subcutaneous tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Drug discovery"}
