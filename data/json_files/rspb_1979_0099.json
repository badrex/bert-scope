They discovered that these antigens are present in some transformed human cells, suggesting a possible role in the host-parasite relationship of human pregnancy and cancer. The selective localization of these antigens at the interface of the mother and fetus indicates that they may play a biological role in maintaining the successful relationship between the mother and the developing fetus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
