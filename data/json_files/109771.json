Due to unfavorable weather, he could only obtain eight observations of the sun. The deduced obliquity of the ecliptic at the late solstice was 230\u00b0 27' 471\"35. The small discordance with the summer solstice could be resolved by modifying Bradley's refractions, but the Astronomer Royal needed more data before making any corrections.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Earth's Seasons"}
