They found that the rate of appearance of CS has been measured, and in some cases, they were able to follow the rate of appearance of S2 and the rate of disappearance of CS. The results provide insights into the decomposition process and the excited electronic states of CS.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
