They also discovered that the addition of phosphate to the yeast juice affects the fermentation rate, with an optimal concentration for maximum fermentation. The authors also observed that fructose can induce rapid fermentation in glucose or mannose when a large excess of phosphate is present.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
