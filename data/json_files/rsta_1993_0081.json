The authors focus on the application of oxygen isotopes in quartz cements and noble gas isotopes in crustal fluids to understand the processes involved in diagenesis and fluid circulation patterns. These techniques help to trace the origins of fluids and quantify their interactions with the Earth's crust and mantle."}
