Norman Lockyer, discusses the advancements in solar spectrum analysis, enabling the study of the chemical composition of the Sun's atmosphere. He confirms the presence of elements such as Sr, Pb, Cd, K, Ce, and U, and suggests the possible presence of other elements. The research also explores the relationship between stars and nebulae, as their spectra can be difficult to distinguish.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar Physics"}
