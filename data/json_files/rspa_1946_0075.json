The author demonstrates that the probability of certain multiple scattering processes can be large, including the possibility of a photon dividing into multiple photons in the presence of an electron. This supports the existence of photon showers where quanta are emitted simultaneously, contrary to previous beliefs.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetic Theory"}
