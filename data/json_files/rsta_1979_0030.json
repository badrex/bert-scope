They found that uranium enrichment occurred in areas with basement disrupted by magmatism or deep faulting. The study's findings can help establish exploration targets and improve understanding of uranium mineralization in the region.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
