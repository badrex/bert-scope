The study finds that the reflected shock is made up of straight segments and a curved portion, with the pressure being lower in the region of non-uniform flow between the segments. The findings may have implications for understanding and mitigating the effects of blast waves on buildings and infrastructure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
