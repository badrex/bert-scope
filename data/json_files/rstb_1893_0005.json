The brain has a simple structure, similar to the brains of embryos of higher mammals, and has a unique decussation or commissure above the anterior commissure. The author also discusses the differences in brain structure between non-placental and placental mammals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
