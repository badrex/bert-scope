The researchers found that a significant decline in fertility occurs below a density of 10^4 spermatozoa per cubic centimeter, suggesting that a higher number of spermatozoa is necessary for successful fertilization. The findings contribute to understanding factors affecting fertility and sterility in normal breeding.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
