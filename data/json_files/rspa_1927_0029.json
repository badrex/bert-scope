They discovered that lead, nickel, and iron exhibit passive properties due to the presence of an insoluble, electrically conducting coating of higher oxide. The study also revealed that valve metals, such as antimony and tantalum, have unique charging and discharging behavior, suggesting the presence of a condenser made up of the electrode and the electrolyte.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
