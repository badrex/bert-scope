The iridescence is caused by the corneal endothelial cells containing arrays of oriented lamellae, which are derived from endoplasmic reticulum. The fish's cornea reflects light due to an interference system, with the reflecting plates being located in the corneal endothelial cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Anatomy and Physiology"}
