They discover that the grains consist of hemialbumose, globulins, and crystalloids, which have varying solubility in water, salt solutions, and after treatment with alcohol. This research provides insights into the complex composition and behavior of aleurone-grains in seeds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biochemistry"}
