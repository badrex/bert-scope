They find that these organisms primarily use viscous forces for propulsion, and their movement can be explained by the propagation of disturbances along thin flagella or tails. The authors develop a mathematical model using Stokeslet and doublet distributions to describe the velocity field and predict the velocity of propulsion for these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology and Biomechanics"}
