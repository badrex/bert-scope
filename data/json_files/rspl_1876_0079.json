The author extends previous methods to explore these systems further and introduces a classification of systems based on their formation of thirds. Additionally, the article delves into the transformation of generalized keyboards and provides a rule for arranging key-boards of higher orders.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Music Theory"}
