The authors found that the emission of dust from the nucleus is sporadic and localized, rather than continuous, and that the dust and gas content of the coma change in parallel. The observations provide valuable information for understanding the composition and behavior of comets in the Solar System.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Solar System Studies"}
