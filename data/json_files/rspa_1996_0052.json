The authors found that CO2+ ions are the first to form in these flames, followed by O2+ ions. They also determined the rate constants for the forward and reverse steps of the reactions involving these ions. The study provides a better understanding of the chemical processes occurring in oxygen-rich flames and their applications, such as in internal combustion engines.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction dynamics"}
