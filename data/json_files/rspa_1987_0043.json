They found that the ratio of dehydrogenation to hydrogenation rates did not match the expected values based on standard thermodynamic free energies of formation. This suggests that reaction products may separate and segregate on the platinum surface, affecting the reaction rates. The results highlight the importance of understanding the chemistry of catalytic sites on platinum surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
