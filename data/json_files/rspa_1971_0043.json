Their approach combines the integral method of Campbell and Slattery with the differential momentum equation, leading to a straightforward solution that can be expressed in closed form. This method is useful for engineering design and can be extended to fluids with varying temperature and viscosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
