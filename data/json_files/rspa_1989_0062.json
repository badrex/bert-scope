The method uses a weighted average of the flux function over the entire structure of the solution of the Riemann problem, resulting in higher accuracy without the need for solving generalized Riemann problems or adding an anti-diffusive term. The method is second-order accurate for model equations and provides oscillation-free results for nonlinear systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Numerical Analysis"}
