It explores the relationship between covert attention movements and eye movements, and how attention can be drawn from external sources or moved according to internal expectations. The study also examines the balance between orienting of attention and sensory inhibition, and its implications for cognitive function.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Attention control"}
