He also explores the effects of different wire thicknesses and arrangements, and the influence of magnets on each other's forces. Faraday concludes that coalescing lines of force from different magnets does not increase the total force and that the analogy between magnets and voltaic piles is perfect.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
