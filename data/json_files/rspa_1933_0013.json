The authors develop a general theory and apply it to calculate excitation probabilities for hydrogen and helium atoms. The results provide insights into the behavior of electrons during inelastic collisions and help explain observed angular distributions of scattered electrons.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
