The results show that elements such as Si, K, P, S, and Cl are spatially organized within the macrohairs during different stages of silicification. The changes in the inorganic content of the macrohairs are related to a silicification process associated with cellular activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
