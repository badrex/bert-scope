They proposed a theory that recognizes that intersystem crossing must become reversible at low pressures, and that the dependence of intersystem crossing rates on the density of states and energy of excitation must be taken into account. This research has implications for understanding photophysical processes in the gas phase and their relevance to theories of radiationless conversion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
