They found that different metals produced different initial distributions of deutero-ethanes and determined the activation energies and frequency factors for the reactions. The results provide insights into the efficiency of metals in catalyzing the reaction and the underlying mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
