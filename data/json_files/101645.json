They noticed that certain lakes never freeze, while others freeze quickly, and that the steam rising from one lake, Loch Ness, seems to keep the surrounding area warm and plants thriving. They also discussed the possibility of the water turning holly into a greenish stone and its potential uses.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Weather"}
