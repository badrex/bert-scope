W. Hofmann, discusses his research on the isomerism of diatomic compounds, specifically focusing on poly-ammonias. He describes experiments involving diethyloxamate of ethyl and its transformations, as well as the separation of ethylated ammonias using oxalate of ethyl. Hofmann also mentions the formation of new organic bases containing both ethylene and oxalyl, which will be the subject of a future communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
