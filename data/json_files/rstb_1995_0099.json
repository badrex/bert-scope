They found that both marine and terrestrial dietary sources influenced the fatty acid isotope composition, and the differences in values between marine and terrestrial organisms were passed on to individual fatty acids. This information can help understand the nutritional dependence of arctic foxes on different food sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Environmental Science"}
