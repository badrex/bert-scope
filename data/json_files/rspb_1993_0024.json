They found that the levels of heterozygosity and allelic diversity reflect each population's history and reveal substructuring within the indigenous British population in Wales. This study provides valuable information for understanding the genetic health of the red kite populations and their conservation efforts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
