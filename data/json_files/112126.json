They demonstrate this through experiments involving the combination of various salts and the observation of crystal formation under a microscope. The results show that the quantity of matter affects the rate of disintegration and the formation of new crystals, providing insights into the processes of chemical reactions and crystal growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Bonding and Reaction Mechanisms"}
