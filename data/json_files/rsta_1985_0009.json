The authors explore the role of anion order in inducing superconductivity and provide guidelines for synthesizing new highly conducting anionic derivatives of TMTSF and ET. They also analyze the crystal and molecular structures of these systems, highlighting the importance of understanding these structures to modify their electrical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic chemistry"}
