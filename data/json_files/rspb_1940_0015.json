The researchers found that the pituitary gland, specifically the anterior lobe, plays a crucial role in controlling the eel's melanophores and their response to different lighting conditions. The study also discovered that the pituitary gland produces two hormones, W and B, which work together to control the eel's coloration. The findings provide insights into the hormonal regulation of color changes in eels and other animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
