They show that the structure of the space-group operations that commute with the Dirac Hamiltonian is determined by the point-group of the crystal field. The authors also discuss the three cases of time-reversal symmetry in the context of the Dirac equation and provide a more straightforward proof of Wigner's theorems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
