The device uses four electromagnetic horns and can measure wavelengths in air, allowing for the calculation of phase velocity in vacuo. The study focuses on diffraction correction, errors from wave-front distortion, and random scattering of micro-wave energy. The interferometer shows potential for high-precision velocity measurements at higher frequencies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
