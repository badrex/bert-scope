They analyzed foraminifer, mollusc, and pollen samples from the area and found that the marine sediments were deposited under both temperate and colder conditions. The findings suggest that the temperate stage at Bramerton represents a new stage in the East Anglian Pleistocene succession, called the Bramertonian, while the subsequent cold stage is equivalent to the Pre-Pastonian substage of the Norfolk coast.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology", "sub_discipline": "Stratigraphy and Paleontology"}
