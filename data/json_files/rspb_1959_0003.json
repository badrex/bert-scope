The older roots have a higher concentration of cytochromes b and b3, but their reduction is almost abolished. This suggests that the changes in respiratory oxidations in older barley roots are not due to the disappearance of the cytochrome system but rather to its dysfunction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
