They found that the quantum yield and the ratio of variable to maximal fluorescence increased from May to August and decreased in September. The results showed a linear correlation between the quantum yield and the fluorescence ratio, and the efficiency of light-energy conversion to dry matter by the crop was correlated with changes in the quantum yield during the growing season.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
