The research focuses on the low Mach number regime, where it is shown that slow waves in a Rankine vortex in a cylindrical container and in an unbounded vortex are due to a discontinuity in the gradient of the radial component of the disturbance velocity. The study clarifies uncertainties regarding the existence of waves in an unbounded Rankine vortex and provides a simple analytic expression for their growth rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
