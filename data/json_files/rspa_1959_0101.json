They found that fatigue-hardened copper specimens have a higher yield stress and a greater temperature dependence than work-hardened specimens. The study suggests that point defects play a significant role in the hardening observed during fatigue tests at room temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Mechanical Properties"}
