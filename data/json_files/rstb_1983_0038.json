It focuses on the phosphorylation of myofibrillar proteins, such as tropomyosin, troponin I, and the P light chain of myosin. The study highlights the importance of these phosphorylation processes in modulating the contractile response in striated muscle and the activation of actomyosin ATPase in vertebrate smooth muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology and Biochemistry"}
