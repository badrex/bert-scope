The authors demonstrate that strong crosslinking of the antigen receptor induces apoptosis of mature B cells, while weaker crosslinking activates them. They also discuss the molecular mechanisms involved in the rescue of B cells from apoptosis through CD40-mediated signaling, which is essential for the immune system's response to foreign antigens.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
