They discovered that negative electricity is dispersed more rapidly than positive, and that atmospheric conductivity is affected by weather patterns such as wind direction and strength. This study provides valuable insights into the relationship between atmospheric electrical charge and weather phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
