The authors used a pendulum chronograph to measure the time taken for sound waves to travel through various gases, such as nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and methane, at different temperatures. The results provided insights into the specific heat of gases and the ratio of specific heats, which is essential for understanding gas dynamics and thermodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
