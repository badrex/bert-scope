By employing a new measurement algorithm that utilizes two-wavelength interferometry, they were able to overcome the limitations of previous experiments and obtain accurate results for the anomalous dispersion corrections in zirconium.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics", "article_id": "rspa_1977_0068"}
