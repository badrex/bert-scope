The authors propose a theoretical approach to understanding the electrical forces acting on electrons and positive ions near metal surfaces, considering factors such as space charge and image force. They also provide calculations on the probability of neutralization and electron emission, suggesting that one electron will, on average, be extracted by the field before the ion approaches the surface too closely, giving the ion a high probability of becoming neutralized.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
