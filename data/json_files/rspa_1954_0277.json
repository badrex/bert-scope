They found that the limiting size for explosion is of the order of a few microns and that the necessary hot-spot size is large on a molecular scale. The experiments also showed that the activation of a small group of adjacent molecules is not enough to cause explosion, and that decomposition takes place preferentially at defects within the crystal structure."}
