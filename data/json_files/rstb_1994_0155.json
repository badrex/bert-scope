It finds that certain HLA alleles, such as HLA-B53 and HLA-DRB1*1302, are associated with resistance to severe malaria. The study supports the idea that pathogen-driven selection has played a significant role in maintaining MHC (major histocompatibility complex) diversity in human populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
