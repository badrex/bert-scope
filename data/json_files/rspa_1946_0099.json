They investigated the effects of time, gas concentration, and temperature on the reaction. The main products of the reaction were ethylene oxide, carbon dioxide, and water. The authors proposed a reaction scheme involving the adsorption of oxygen and the formation of various intermediates, including ethylene oxide and acetaldehyde. The study provided insights into the role of the catalyst in the oxidation process and the complex reactions taking place."}
