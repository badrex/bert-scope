They injected a jet of magnetite slurry into a transparent box filled with water to observe the trajectory under the influence of density differences. The study provides a method to predict the axes of heterogeneous jet systems and compares the predicted results with observations in the water model, offering valuable insights for combustion engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
