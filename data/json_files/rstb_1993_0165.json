The authors found that sympathetic nerve stimulation and 5-hydroxytryptamine play a significant role in gastric motility patterns for digestion and vomiting. The results provide insights into the autonomic control of gastric motility in elasmobranchs and contribute to the understanding of the evolution of visceral function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
