The observations were compared with those made by Captain Maguire in 1852, 1853, and 1854. The results showed that the intensity of the disturbing force was less at Port Kennedy than at Point Barrow, and the disturbances formed distinct categories of easterly and westerly deflections. The author also reviewed the phenomena of the solar-diurnal variation and the caution needed when deriving the epochs of the decennial period from the magnitude of the diurnal range of the declination-magnet.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
