This observation provided evidence of Jupiter's rotation around its axis, similar to the way the Sun rotates around its axis. The discovery of permanent spots on Jupiter allowed scientists to measure the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate, which was found to be 9 hours and 56 minutes. This observation was compared to the way Earth rotates around its axis, as well as the potential rotation of other planets.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Observational Astronomy"}
