They discuss the superiority of photographic sun-observations over previous methods and the distribution of sunspots on the solar surface. The authors also express the need for further study of solar flares and hope for more extensive photographic sun-observation systems in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Astronomy"}
