(Diptera)", "semantic_tags": ["Insect cuticle", "Puparium formation", "Tyrosinase", "Oxidation-reduction potential", "Insect biology"], "tldr": "The author examines the structural and chemical changes in the cuticle of the mature larva of Sarcophaga as it transforms into the puparium. The hardening of the puparium is due to the action of a phenol derived from the blood, with a polyphenol oxidase located in the inner epicuticle responsible for the rapid oxidation of the phenol. The study also explores the role of the pupation hormone and the oxidation-reduction potential of the blood in the hardening process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Biology"}
