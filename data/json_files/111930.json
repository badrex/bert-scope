The author, Thomas Graham, examines various substances and their transpiration times, concluding that the presence of constitutional water in hydrates can affect their transpiration rates. This study highlights the potential use of transpiration times as an additional tool for determining chemical composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
