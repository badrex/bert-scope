They found that the absorption of energy in these alloys is due to the destruction of short-range order, and the critical temperature is less than 75\u00b0C. The atomic mobility plays a significant role in controlling the kinetics of ordering and disordering in these alloys.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
