Cayley, explores the properties of secondary caustics and their envelopes, specifically for parallel rays refracted at a circle. They derive equations for the envelope and tangent of the envelope, and determine the class of the curve to be 4. The author also discusses the existence of cusps and nodes on the curve, providing detailed explanations and conditions for their occurrence.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Differential Geometry"}
