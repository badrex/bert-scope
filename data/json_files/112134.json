They found that the gas is a weak conductor of electricity and has limited solubility with certain substances. The author also observed that the liquefied acid does not dissolve or change the properties of materials like charcoal, fused boracic acid, white phosphorus, and more. The experiments provide insights into the chemical and solvent actions of liquefied hydrochloric acid gas.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid Chemistry"}
