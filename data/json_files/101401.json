He claims to have found a way to create large lenses without molds, resulting in better vision both on Earth and in the sky. Campani also reports observing details on Saturn's rings and Jupiter's protuberances, which could support the Copernican theory. He even managed to spot the shadows of Jupiter's satellites.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
