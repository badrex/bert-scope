He discovered that when air is mechanically expanded, it attracts or absorbs heat from surrounding bodies. This principle can explain the cause of the cold on the summits of high mountains, the sudden condensation of aerial vapor, and the perpetual mutability of atmospheric heat.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
