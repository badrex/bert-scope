They use gravimetric, microchemical, and electron-diffraction methods to study the oxide film's formation and properties. The findings reveal that the rate of oxidation is controlled by metal-ion diffusion above 200\u00b0C and oxygen-ion diffusion below, leading to different oxidation-time relationships. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of iron corrosion and the development of interference colors in the oxide film.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Corrosion and Oxidation"}
