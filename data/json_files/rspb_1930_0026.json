This method is based on the principle of a differential wet-bulb thermometer with high sensitivity. The results can be obtained within 30 to 45 minutes, and the average error of a single observation is around 1% of the difference read. This method has potential applications in various fields, provided the accuracy of temperature measurements can be improved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
