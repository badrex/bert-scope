The surface resistance is related to the magnetic condition of the specimen during initial magnetization and afterwards. The experiment uses tin-indium alloys and demonstrates that the surface resistance at a lower frequency follows the same universal function of field and temperature as at a higher frequency. The authors argue that the motion of flux lines plays a significant role in the absorption of microwave power, providing a new interpretation of the findings."}
