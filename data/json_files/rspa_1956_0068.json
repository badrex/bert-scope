They found that the standard enthalpy of formation of the aqueous azide ion is -228.6 kcal/mol, and the enthalpies of solution for alkali and alkaline-earth azides were measured. These findings provide a better understanding of the explosive nature and reactivity of azides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermochemistry"}
