The author, James Parsons, provides a detailed physical description of the creature, comparing it to known animals like deer and ass. He also discusses its behavior, diet, and habitat. The creature has a deer-like head, unique forward-bending horns, and cloven hooves. Its coat is light ash color, darker on some parts, with white under its belly. It feeds on hay, grass, and greens, and its excrements resemble those of a deer. The author suggests that this creature may belong to a new genus of quadrupeds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
