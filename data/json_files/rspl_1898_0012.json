They observed that degeneration occurred first in the part of the neuron most remote from the cell and found that the spiral nerve termination in the muscle spindle showed changes within 24 hours after sectioning the nerve. The research showed that the spiral nerve termination surrounds a fine muscle fiber with large, clear, non-nucleated cells in the center. The findings also indicated that no fatty changes were demonstrated in the intramuscular cells similar to those found in the case of tabes dorsalis in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuromuscular Physiology"}
