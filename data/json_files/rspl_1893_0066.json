They discuss the development of sporophylls and the role of sterilization in the evolution of vascular plants. The study also explores the origin of synangia in Lycopodineae and its implications for understanding the relationships between different plant families.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
