It shows that the metabolism of glucose in the brain is characterized by a relatively rapid incorporation of glucose carbon into amino acids. The findings suggest that the brain has a unique way of processing glucose compared to other organs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
