It shows that the competition between the strains depends on their previous adaptation to the specific minimal medium, rather than their initial proportions. The study provides insights into the mechanisms of bacterial population changes and the factors affecting them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
