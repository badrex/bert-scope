They found that the length of the dark space varies depending on the type of metal used for the cathode. Magnesium exhibited the smallest dark space and required the lowest potential, while lead had the largest dark space and required the highest potential. The results provide insights into the behavior of gases under different conditions and can be useful for improving vacuum technology.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas discharge physics"}
