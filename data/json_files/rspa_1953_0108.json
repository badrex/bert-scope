They find that the binding energies and heats of reaction of these models reproduce several features observed in real molecules, and that the binding energy of a molecule increases with the increase in nuclear charges. The study provides insights into the behavior of polar molecules and the role of molecular orbital theory in understanding chemical valency.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Quantum Chemistry"}
