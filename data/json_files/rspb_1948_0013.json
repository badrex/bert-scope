They found that bacterial cells can adjust their reducing power through rapid changes in active intermediates and slower enzymatic modifications. The study has implications for understanding the coordination of bacterial cell mechanisms and their ability to adapt to different environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
