The author conducts experiments to obtain accurate data on the variation of neon's viscosity over a wide temperature range. The results provide sufficient data for a reliable comparison of neon's molecular properties, as determined from its viscosity, with values deduced from other sources.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
