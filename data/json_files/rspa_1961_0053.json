The authors found that the reaction follows a step-wise path, with the first atom being much more reactive than the remaining three. They also discovered that when lithium aluminum hydride is present in considerable excess, methyl iodide is rapidly and completely reduced. The authors hope to extend these studies to other organic halogen compounds to derive bond dissociation energies in general.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermochemistry"}
