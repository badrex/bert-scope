It highlights the inefficiencies in nitrogen fertilizer use in the past and the improvements made in recent years due to new high-yielding wheat varieties, better pest and disease control, and earlier sowing. The author emphasizes the importance of understanding the nitrogen cycle and improving nitrogen recovery in agricultural crops to enhance soil fertility and crop yields.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
