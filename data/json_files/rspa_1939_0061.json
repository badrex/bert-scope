They used different methods, including a phase apparatus and ground interference patterns, to measure the amplitude, phase, and polarization of the reflected waves. The results showed that the reflection occurred from a constant height with a phase change of \u03c0 at reflection, and the waves were polarized with a left-handed sense of rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
