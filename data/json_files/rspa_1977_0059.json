The authors find that nonlinear effects prevent the exponential growth of disturbances when the Taylor number exceeds a critical value. The flow obtained in the supercritical regime is synchronous with the basic flow, and an equilibrium amplitude solution exists in a supercritical neighborhood of the marginal configuration.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
