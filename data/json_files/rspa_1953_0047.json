The main application of this formula is the derivation of an expression for the surface tension of a spherical surface between liquid and vapor. The author also discusses the evaluation of stress and the derivation of known formulae for the kinetic pressure and the coefficient of viscosity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
