They found that the visual map on the tectum of tadpoles differs from that in adults, with a progressive shift of the retinotectal projection during development. This research provides insights into the formation of nerve connections in the visual system of amphibians.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
