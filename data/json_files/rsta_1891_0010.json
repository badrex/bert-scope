The author found that the magnetic term influences the intensity of reflected light and that the effects produced by magnetization vary with the angle of incidence. However, a complete explanation of these phenomena requires a more advanced electromagnetic theory of metallic reflection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
