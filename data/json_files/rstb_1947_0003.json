The authors discuss the functions of ctenidia, hypobranchial glands, and osphradia, and how they form a functional unit. They also explore the evolution of the mantle cavity and its adaptations in different Mollusca groups, such as pectinibranchs, Scaphopoda, and Lamellibranchia.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
