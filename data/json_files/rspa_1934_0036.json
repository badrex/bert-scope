It investigates the effect of uniform electric and magnetic fields on the Fermi distribution and provides a comprehensive analysis of the wave equation for electrons in a periodic potential. The findings contribute to the understanding of electronic conduction in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
