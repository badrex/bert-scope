The authors demonstrate how radiocarbon dating and dendrochronology can provide accurate dates and reveal climatic information. They discuss the relevance of medieval, Egyptian, and American dates to the study of climatic and radiocarbon variability and suggest that radiocarbon measurements may serve as an indicator or tracer for climatic changes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climatology"}
