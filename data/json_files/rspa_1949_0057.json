The authors examine the adsorption of hydrogen and heterocyclic compounds on these catalysts and study the chemical equilibria in the reduction of nickel sulphide. They propose two separate mechanisms by which molybdenum sulphide and nickel subsulphide function in the catalytic decomposition process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
