They discovered that lead has a unique isotopic composition due to its formation through different processes of radioactive disintegration. The author also found evidence of a hydride effect in the mass-spectra, which they used to correct their measurements and improve the accuracy of their results.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Isotopes and Atomic Weights"}
