The author explores the different specificities of hexoses and their impact on energy availability and transport mechanisms in the columnar epithelial cells of the intestine. The article highlights the importance of understanding these interactions for a better understanding of the movement of salt and water in living tissues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Physiology"}
