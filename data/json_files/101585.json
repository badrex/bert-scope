The process involves filling the casks with wine and allowing it to ferment by exchanging the wine between the casks daily. The best wine produces the best vinegar, and the process must be carefully maintained to prevent contamination and ensure proper fermentation. Vinegar made this way is used for food preservation and flavoring.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Food Science"}
