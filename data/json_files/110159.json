They found that dividing the nerves of the lungs causes difficulty in breathing and eventually suffocation. However, applying the right amount of voltaic electricity through the remaining attached nerves can restore the lungs' health, unless it causes inflammation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
