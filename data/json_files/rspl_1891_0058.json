He used a sophisticated apparatus to measure the densities and discussed various sources of error that could affect the results. The experiments showed that the ratio of densities for hydrogen and oxygen was approximately 1:5.8, which helped improve the understanding of gas densities and the scientific method.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas Laws"}
