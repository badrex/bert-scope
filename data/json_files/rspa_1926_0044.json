They developed a method to examine these crystals by observing their behavior under the microscope when exposed to varying temperature and humidity. The results support the theory that the vapor pressure of the saturated solution determines the conditions of deliquescence.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
