The sorption isotherms and thermodynamics were analyzed, revealing the effects of gas molecule size and intercalate size on the sorption behavior. The results showed that the compounds have sorptive capacities comparable to other active adsorbents like zeolites and activated charcoals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Porosity"}
