The fish, which seems to differ from previously known electrical fish, was found in coral rock cavities near the island. Upon touching the fish, Paterson and others experienced electrical shocks, confirming its electrical properties. The fish's unique characteristics and electrical organs make it an interesting subject for further study in natural history.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
