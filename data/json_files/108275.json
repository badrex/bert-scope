He discovered that the induced contractions were not caused by derived currents but were the result of an electric discharge during muscle contraction. Matteucci also found that the muscular current was much stronger than the proper current in frogs, and that acid and alkaline solutions affected the conductivity of the muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
