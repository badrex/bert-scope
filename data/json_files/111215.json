He examines the lunar theory and its improvements, focusing on the motion of the moon's node. Airy also investigates the geographical circumstances and the possible locations of the events, concluding that the eclipse of Thales in B.C. 585 is the most likely to match the historical accounts. He also considers the possibility of a total lunar eclipse for Xerxes' invasion of Greece.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Lunar Theory"}
