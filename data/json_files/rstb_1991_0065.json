CSFs have been used in clinical settings to boost the formation and function of these cells in patients with infections or other diseases. The four main types of CSFs are GM-CSF, G-CSF, M-CSF, and Multi-CSF, which have been purified and produced in recombinant form for medical use.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
