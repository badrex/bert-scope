They found that the ArsA protein has two potential adenylate binding sites and that binding of anionic substrates like antimonite enhances the enzyme's affinity for nucleotides. The authors also discovered that the ArsA protein interacts with the ArsB protein, which serves as the membrane anchor for the pump. This research contributes to understanding the molecular mechanisms of ion transport and resistance in bacteria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry", "sub_discipline": "Membrane Transport Systems"}
