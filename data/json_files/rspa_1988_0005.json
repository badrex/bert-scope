Experiments with water jets discharging into air show that a parabolic axial velocity profile is more stable than a nearly uniform profile. The results support the idea that the initial velocity distribution plays a significant role in jet instability and can affect the contiguous length of the water stream.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
