They find that the seed has a Cycadean character and is inclosed in a husk or cupule. The authors discuss the possible position of the seed on the plant and the systematic position of Lyginodendron. They propose a new class, Pteridospermophyta, to embrace Palaeozoic plants with the habit and internal organization of Ferns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleobotany"}
