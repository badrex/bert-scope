They found that the infectivity of extracts depends on the extraction method, the sequence of events during extraction, and the presence of certain substances in the extraction fluid. The main factor influencing the infectivity of these extracts is the extent to which the virus nucleic acid remains attached to the leaf fragments.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
