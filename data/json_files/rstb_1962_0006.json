The study focuses on the differences between contractile and non-contractile stalks, their fine structure, and cytochemical properties. The author identifies the spasmoneme as the main feature responsible for contraction in contractile stalks and discusses the role of scopula organelles in the development and stability of the stalks. The findings contribute to a better understanding of the biology and evolution of peritrich ciliates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology"}
