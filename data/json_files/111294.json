Gravatt, explores the subject of rotatory motion using prime and ultimate ratios. He explains the motion of a peg-top, the effect of axial rotation on a falling body, and the deviation of a cannonball's flight due to the Earth's rotation. Gravatt also critiques the famous experiment by M. Foucault, demonstrating the Earth's rotation, due to the minute errors that could affect the results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
