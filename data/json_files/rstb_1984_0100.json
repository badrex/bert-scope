The authors describe the structure and processing of the C4 and Slp proteins, as well as the genetic variations in their activity, structure, and regulation. These proteins serve as a useful experimental model for understanding the genetics and biochemistry of clinically important genes and their products in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
