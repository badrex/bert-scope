This design allows for more accurate and precise comparisons of stomatal behavior under various experimental treatments. The device records pressure changes in the resistance porometer circuit, enabling the calculation of leaf and stomatal resistance for viscous air flow. The new porometer design helps improve our understanding of stomatal movement and its response to environmental factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
