They discovered new types of structural faults in the mazzite framework and an unusual coincidence boundary in zeolite L. These findings help to understand the microstructural characteristics and potential value of these materials as heterogeneous catalysts and catalyst supports.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
