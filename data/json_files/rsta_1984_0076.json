The incorrect formulae for and are identified and should be replaced with and. The resonant bifurcations are found to be subcritical and occur to the left of certain points. The authors plan to report on the implications of this bifurcation reversal in a later study.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
