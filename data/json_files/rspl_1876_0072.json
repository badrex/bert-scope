They verified two propositions related to the superposition of electric effects and the relationship between residual and exciting charges. The authors also investigated the conductivity and residual charge in various glasses, suggesting that electrolytic conduction may occur in some types of glass at room temperature. Their findings support the principle of superposition in the phenomenon of conduction through glass.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
