The experiments were made using four needles, and the results were essential for navigation and understanding the Earth's magnetic field. The study provided valuable insights into the influence of iron ores and volcanic rocks on the magnetic field.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
