He discovered the bactericidal property of defibrinated blood, founded the Journal of Hygiene and Parasitology, and conducted groundbreaking research on life under aseptic conditions, the role of insects in disease transmission, and the precipitin reactions. Nuttall's work on blood immunity and blood relationships provided a new method for identifying minute traces of blood and studying phylogenetic relationships among animals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology > Parasitology"}
