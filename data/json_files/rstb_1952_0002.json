The research bridges the gap between the well-known 'Arctic Plant Bed' and the established Post-Glacial vegetational and climatic sequence. The findings reveal that the Late-Glacial period favored the spread of certain plant categories, which is crucial for understanding the history of the British Flora.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology and Paleontology"}
