The authors develop a theory that considers the statistical creation of a new structure due to layer displacement faults occurring in a specific manner. They predict observable diffraction effects, such as changes in integrated intensity, peak shift, integral breadth, and peak asymmetry, which can be used to determine the mechanism that actually occurs during the transformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
