The author found that the germinating power of seeds decreases over time, but the presence of enzymes in resting seeds can still be detected even when germination is no longer possible. The author also discovered that the germinating power of seeds is related to the climate in which they are stored, with drier climates preserving seed life longer. However, the addition of external enzymes to non-germinating seeds did not improve germination.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
