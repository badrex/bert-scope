The authors show that knl and related genes are expressed in the meristem and stem, and that their expression patterns suggest these genes are appropriate markers for the meristem. Ectopic expression of knl and related genes in Arabidopsis and tobacco leads to alterations in leaf morphology, including the formation of small shoots. The study provides insights into the role of homeobox genes in plant development and meristem function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
