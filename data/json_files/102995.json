Papin, describes an improvement to the Hessian bellows, a device used to pump air, and its potential applications in mining and furnace operations. He explains how the bellows can be used to create a strong airflow for respiration in mines and to control the environment within furnaces, preventing fire from escaping and allowing for the working of materials at high temperatures. The Hessian bellows also have potential for use in creating large glass pipes and mirrors.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
