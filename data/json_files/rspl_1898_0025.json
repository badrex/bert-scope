The compensated dilatometer uses a tripod of platinum-iridium and a disc of aluminum to provide absolute measurements of expansion. The instrument can be used for various crystals, including chemical preparations, and offers improved precision compared to previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
