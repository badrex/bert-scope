The theory involves a four-potential and two universal constants, and it distinguishes between neutral and charged particles. The author discusses the energy-momentum tensor, charged particles, and neutral particles, providing numerical results for the mass spectrum of the lowest neutral particle states.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
