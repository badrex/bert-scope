The reproductive activity in male grey squirrels varies, with some remaining sexually immature throughout the winter and starting to breed in the spring. The research also shows that there is no constant relationship between testes weight and body weight, suggesting individual fluctuations in reproductive activity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
