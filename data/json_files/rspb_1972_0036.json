The estuary faces challenges due to increasing demands for water, waste disposal, and maintaining recreational resources. Studies on the estuary's ecology, pollutant levels, and their distribution indicate that water quality needs control to avoid problems related to fisheries, eutrophication, and drinking water quality. The article highlights the importance of research on pollutant pathways and their effects on biological communities to balance industrial development with the maintenance of the estuary's amenities.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Estuaries and Coastal Ecosystems"}
