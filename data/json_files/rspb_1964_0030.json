They discovered that the fibers have two capacitances in the path between the inside and outside, one with a resistance in series. This finding helps to explain the disparity in capacitance measurements of striated muscle fibers and provides insights into the muscle fiber's structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Physiology"}
