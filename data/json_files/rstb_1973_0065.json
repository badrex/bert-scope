It explores the concept of biological ceilings, which represent the maximum genetic improvement of livestock, and the factors that limit their achievement. The article also examines reproductive efficiency, longevity, growth rate, feed conversion, and disease in relation to animal production systems. The author suggests that improvements in these areas could lead to increased agricultural productivity and better utilization of natural resources.", "scientific_discipline": "Animal Sciences > Livestock Production"}
