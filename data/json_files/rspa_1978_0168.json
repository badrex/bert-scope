This transformation reduces the problem to solving the wave equation, making it easier to understand the connection between the noise field produced by an aircraft statically and in flight. The study has important implications for wind-tunnel and low-speed flight tests, as it suggests using a coordinate system fixed relative to the model or aircraft body for analyzing test results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
