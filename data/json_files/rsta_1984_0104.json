They demonstrated that the dynamic Burstein-Moss shift is responsible for the large nonlinear index in indium arsenide at the band gap. The findings suggest the potential for an impressive room-temperature computational capability using indium arsenide.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
