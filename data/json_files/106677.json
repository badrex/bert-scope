He discovered that the result of the union of dephlogisticated and inflammable air is not just water, but an acid. Priestley also investigated the effect of phlogisticated air on the process and found that the acid produced was less when using atmospheric air or impure dephlogisticated air. This led to the conclusion that the acid did not come from the phlogisticated air that could not be excluded.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Acid-Base Chemistry"}
