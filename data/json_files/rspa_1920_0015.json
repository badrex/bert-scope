They found that the viscosity of sulphur is highly sensitive to temperature changes and that the physical properties of sulphur provide a more accurate method of detecting changes than other properties such as density, coefficient of expansion, or surface tension.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
