They measured the excitation functions for the formation of radioactive isotopes and compared the results with theoretical predictions. The study helps to understand the mechanisms of nuclear reactions and the role of the Gamow process and Oppenheimer-Phillips process in these reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
