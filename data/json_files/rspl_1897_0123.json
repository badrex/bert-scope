The study also showed that the known suprarenal bodies of teleostean fishes resemble the inter-renal body of elasmobranchs and the cortical portion of the suprarenal capsules of higher vertebrates. This research supports the idea that the suprarenal gland in teleostean fishes consists entirely of cortex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
