They found that the thermal resistance in the intermediate state can take an anomalously high value, and that the domain pattern plays a crucial role in determining the overall resistance. The results are in satisfactory agreement with Andreev's theory and provide insights into the behavior of superconductors in the intermediate state.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
