He discovered that spermatozoa not only come into contact with the egg's surface during fertilization but can also penetrate the egg's outer layers. This finding led to a revision of his previous views on the nature of impregnating influence.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Reproductive Biology"}
