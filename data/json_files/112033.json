They observed secular variations in these elements and found that the west declination reached a maximum in 1801 and the inclination reached a minimum in 1910. The study suggests that a man's lifetime or even a century is a small part of the secular period of terrestrial magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
