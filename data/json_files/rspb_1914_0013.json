They identify the ivory pigment as apigenin, a flavone, and the yellow pigment as luteolin. The factorial difference between the two varieties lies in their ability to produce these pigments; the ivory variety forms apigenin throughout the flower, while the yellow variety forms luteolin in the upper epidermis of the lips.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
