The authors used a plane grating spectrograph to isolate homogeneous X-ray radiations and divided the beam into two parts, one passing through a metal foil and the other not. They determined the absorption coefficients by measuring the ratio of the photographic densities of the two segments of the line corresponding to the two portions of the beam. The results provide valuable data for understanding the absorption of X-rays by metal foils in this wavelength range.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > X-ray Spectroscopy"}
