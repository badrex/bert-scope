The authors explore the differences in membrane structure and function, as well as the asymmetry between the two faces of a membrane. They also examine the role of electron microscopy in understanding the composition and molecular configurations within biological membranes, providing insights into membrane biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Membrane Biology"}
