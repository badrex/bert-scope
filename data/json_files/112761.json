The study reveals that the granites of central and western Scotland are metamorphic rocks, while truly eruptive granite is rare. The author also discusses the oxygen ratios and analyses of these minerals, providing evidence for their classification.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Mineralogy"}
