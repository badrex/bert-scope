The family is divided into three genera: Eua, Samoana, and Partula. The article explores the factors contributing to the species' extinction, such as artificial introductions, urban and agricultural development, and ill-conceived biological control programs. It also highlights the need for further research on the family's origins, evolution within species, and the potential for some species to be secure in the wild.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Conservation"}
