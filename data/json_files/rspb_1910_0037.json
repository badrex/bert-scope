{"article_id": "rspb_1910_0037", "revised_title": "Investigating Assimilation Rates in Plant Leaves", "semantic_tags": ["Plant Assimilation", "Photosynthesis", "Respiration", "Stomata", "Plant Physiology"], "tldr": "The authors conducted experiments to study the rate of assimilation in plant leaves, specifically in Helianthus annuus, under natural conditions. They used the half-leaf dry-weight method to measure the rate of increase in dry weight and found that stomatal aperture plays a significant role in regulating the rate of assimilation. The results suggest that the earlier work on this topic had some errors, and the authors provide a more accurate method for measuring assimilation rates in plant leaves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
