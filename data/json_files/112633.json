The authors found that the rate of the reaction is directly proportional to the amount of iodide in the solution and that the amount of chemical change is proportional to the amount of peroxide present at any given moment. The study also shows that the reaction rate is not affected by the presence of hydric sulphate or hydric chloride. The authors plan to further investigate the influence of temperature on the reaction in future research."}
