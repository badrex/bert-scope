They discovered that the radiations cause hemolysis in red blood cells and affect the function of leucocytes and blood serum components, such as opsonin and complement. The findings suggest that radium radiations can have significant impacts on the blood and immune system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hematology"}
