They tested this hypothesis by irradiating sections of transplantable tumors in vitro under different conditions and then transplanting them. The results showed that the respiratory system is the most vulnerable to short-wave radiations and that altering the functional activity of the respiratory mechanism can affect the susceptibility of cells to radium.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
