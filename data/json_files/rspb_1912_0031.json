The lantern acts as a lever, with the muscles pushing the urchin forward and lifting it up, while the spines help in maintaining balance. This study provides a deeper understanding of the mechanics of sea urchin locomotion and their adaptation to their environment.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Echinoderms"}
