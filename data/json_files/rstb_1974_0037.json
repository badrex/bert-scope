The study compared two villages, Kaul and Lufa, and found that despite differences in air temperature and humidity, the overall thermal stress was similar in both locations. The villagers' responses to thermal stress were investigated, including their clothing, housing, and activities. The research provides insights into human adaptability in tropical ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Human Environmental Physiology"}
