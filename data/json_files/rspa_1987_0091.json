They calculate the transmitted power, averaged over a frequency band and all incidence angles, and provide asymptotic results for both resonance and non-resonance contributions. The predictions are compared with experimental results and numerical methods, showing improvements over previous theories. The study focuses on two-dimensional and three-dimensional geometries, with implications for practical applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
