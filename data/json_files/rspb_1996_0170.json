This finding extends the fossil record of Varanopseidae from the Late Carboniferous to Late Permian, making it the longest of any known lineage of Palaeozoic amniotes. The presence of Elliotsmithia in Gondwana demonstrates that 'pelycosaurs' were not restricted to equatorial regions but spread across the supercontinent of Pangaea with therapsids during the Late Permian.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Paleontology"}
