The authors find that the overall baroclinic wave activity is well correlated with time-varying forcing for large Ekman number flows, while smaller Ekman numbers may result in wave amplitude vacillation between different equilibrium states. The results have implications for understanding the role of baroclinic waves in the energy and momentum balance of the atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
