They introduce a cluster approach that considers the structural organization of macroscopic samples and the steady-state distribution of clusters. This model helps to understand the dynamics of imperfect materials and their relaxation behavior, providing insights into dielectric relaxation spectroscopy and the structure of imperfect materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
