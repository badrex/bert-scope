The discovery of Calcium Silicalcyanide and the synthesis of felspar Anorthite supports the idea that aluminum plays a role in certain silicides, similar to nitrogen in organic compounds. This research provides insights into the constitution and natural relations of aluminosilicate minerals like plagio-clasic felspars.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
