It presents a model based on ordered water structures, similar to clathrate hydrates, which provide suitable low-energy binding sites for specific ions. The model also shows that the potential barriers for ion motion within these channels are low, allowing for high mobility once the ions are inside.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
