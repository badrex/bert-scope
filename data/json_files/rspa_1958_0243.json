The authors develop a practical approach that extends the work of Brueckner and others, who have applied their methods to an infinite nuclear medium. The article focuses on the energy expansion, self-consistent equations, and variational procedure for calculating the energy of a nucleus.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
