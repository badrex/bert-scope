They found a gradient in glycogen concentration, with the highest concentration at the animal pole and the lowest at the vegetal pole. The study also showed a significant decrease in glycogen concentration in the organizer region during the transition from the blastula to the gastrula stage. This research provides insights into the role of glycogen in the development of amphibians.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
