The authors provide a formal solution for the cases of heavy and light fluid loading and fluid coupling, and evaluate the solution in the limits of large and small plate spacing. The results offer analytical approximations to the sound scattered by connected plates, which can be useful in underwater applications and for the study of periodically connected plates.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Acoustics"}
