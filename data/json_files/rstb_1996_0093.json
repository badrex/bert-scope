Over 80% of odontocete species and two balaen whale species include cephalopods in their diet regularly, with some species relying on them as their main food source. The most important cephalopod families in the diet of cetaceans are the oceanic Ommastrephidae, Histioteuthidae, and Cranchiidae, while neritic Loliginidae are more significant on continental shelves. The study highlights the regional, seasonal, and annual variations in the species composition of cephalopods consumed by cetaceans and the positive correlation between prey size and the size of pelagic feeding cetacean species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
