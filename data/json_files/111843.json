Kirkman, introduces the concepts of autopolar and sympolar polyhedra, which are pairs of polyhedra with corresponding summits and faces. He also presents two theorems to represent these pairs, one being a closed polygon of angles and the other tracing a closed polygon on the faces of the polyhedra.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
