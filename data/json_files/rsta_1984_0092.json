{"article_id": "rsta_1984_0092", "revised_title": "Cometary Nuclei Rotation and Its Implications", "semantic_tags": ["Solar System", "Comets", "Rotation", "Sublimation", "Asteroids"], "tldr": "This article discusses the rotation of cometary nuclei and its implications. It examines the spin periods of comets, which are longer than those of asteroids, and suggests that comets may have formed through accretion rather than fragmentation. The study also explores the effects of sublimation on cometary nuclei, including the net thrust caused by gas emission and the resulting rotation and precession of the axis. The article concludes that cometary spin-down is more likely than spin-up, and that explanations for cometary splitting must be found elsewhere.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
