The authors demonstrate that the methylation of cytosine residues within developmentally important genes may play a role in cellular determination. They also show that MyoD1, a gene involved in myogenesis, is subject to methylation control in vitro, which may have implications for the establishment of immortal cell lines and tumors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Epigenetics"}
