It introduces a reduced Hamiltonian to describe the metallic state and examines the effects of electromagnetic fluctuations on the cohesive properties of metals. The author emphasizes the importance of considering both bound and free charge fluctuations in understanding bonding, structure, and ordering in condensed matter.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
