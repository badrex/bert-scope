They found that as oxygen interacts with the surfaces, Ni2+ and Ni3+ states are formed, which are characteristic features of oxygen interaction with nickel surfaces. The study provides insights into the defect chemistry and reactivity of oxide overlayers on nickel surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
