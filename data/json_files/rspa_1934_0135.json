They argue that a priori probabilities are necessary for a general theory of scientific inference and that the likelihood of a hypothesis is determined by its prior probability and the data of experience. The author also addresses criticisms of the theory and clarifies its meaning and purpose.", "scientific_discipline": "Philosophy of Science > Bayesian Probability"}
