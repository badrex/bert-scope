The research focuses on thalamocortical, commissural, and association connections in the motor and somatic sensory cortices. The findings provide insights into the ultrastructure and sites of termination of these connections, contributing to the understanding of the complex neural networks in the brain.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroanatomy"}
