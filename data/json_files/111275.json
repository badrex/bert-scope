The sphygmoscope works by using a small chamber with a rubber wall that is applied to the chest, detecting the heart's movements and displaying them through a glass tube. This instrument can help determine the frequency, duration, and strength of heartbeats, making it a valuable tool for understanding heart health.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Cardiology"}
