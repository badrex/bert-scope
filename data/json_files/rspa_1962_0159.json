The author examines the relevant aspects of tensor algebra and representation theory, focusing on the classification of irreducible representations and the reduction of products of these representations. The article provides a tabulation of isoscalar factors for the product of two eight-dimensional representations of SU(3), which can be used to compute reduction coefficients and facilitate calculations in reactions between elementary particles within the framework of the octet model.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
