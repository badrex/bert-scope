The authors explore the enzymatic activity of pp60src, a protein kinase associated with the Rous sarcoma virus, and its potential impact on cell transformation. They also examine the similarities between the protein kinase activities of different classes of avian sarcoma viruses and their shared ability to phosphorylate protein substrates at tyrosine residues.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
