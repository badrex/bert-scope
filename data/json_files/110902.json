This phenomenon, now known as the Faraday effect, demonstrates a connection between electricity, magnetism, and light. Faraday's experiments also showed that the rotation direction depends on the direction of the magnetic field and the polarization of the light ray.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
