The research compares this phylogeny to previously proposed classifications and examines the evolution of key anatomical features, such as the number of gills used for brooding, incubation length, larval tooth structures, and shell texture. The findings support the distinction of the Margaritiferidae family from other unionaceans and provide insights into the evolutionary relationships and reproductive traits of these mussels.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
