The authors explore the various aspects of symbiotic relationships, including the unity of the organisms, the mutual modification of their structures, and the causal factors leading to the establishment and persistence of the symbiosis. They also address the challenges in categorizing symbiotic relationships and suggest that the term \"functional field\" may be more appropriate for describing these complex interactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Organism Interactions"}
