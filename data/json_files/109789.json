He observed that the direction of heat and the attraction of the electric fluid depend on the nature of the combustible body. The results support the identity of common and voltaic electricity and provide insights into the inherent electrical states of different species of matter. The author also discusses the phenomena of unipolar bodies and their behavior when connected to a voltaic battery.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
