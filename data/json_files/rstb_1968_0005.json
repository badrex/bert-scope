The authors describe the genetics of shell colors such as white lip, faint pink, pale brown, and yellow-white, as well as the banding patterns and the suppression of the band in mid-banded snails. The research provides insights into the genetic basis of the polymorphism in this species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
