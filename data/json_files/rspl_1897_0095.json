They found that these fluids can support the growth of the bacillus, and that fresh air and sunlight can disinfect the bacillus in the presence of sufficient organic material. This research provides insights into the conditions that contribute to the spread of tuberculosis and suggests ways to prevent infection.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
