They found that the reaction is topochemical and controlled by the movement of the phase boundary. The decomposition mechanism is based on Mott's model, with the rate-limiting step being the emission of valence electrons from silver azide into silver. The study also examines the morphology of the decomposition surface using scanning electron microscopy and provides insights into the effects of additives on the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solid-state chemistry"}
