They measured various parameters such as body volume, mass, wetted-surface area, and fluke area, comparing these values between species to identify correlations with swimming performance. This research can help improve our understanding of cetacean propulsion, energetics, and locomotion, as well as inform the design of man-made oscillating propellers.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
