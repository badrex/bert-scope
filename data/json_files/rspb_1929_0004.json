The authors discuss historical observations and thermodynamic data, concluding that the breakdown of glycogen to lactic acid in muscle can release more mechanical work than the total loss of energy, suggesting a possible difference in the specific heat of the two substances.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
