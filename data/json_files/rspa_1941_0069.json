They found that the decay curve of the fission products agreed with a complex mixture of radioactive bodies and that the radiation emitted bore a general similarity to neutron-induced fission. The study also measured the ratio of fission cross-sections for 9 MeV deuterons and Li+D neutrons, and the excitation function was studied. The experimental data was compared with calculations based on Bohr and Wheeler's treatment of the fission process mechanism."}
