The author, Charles Rumker, used lunar and solar tables to determine the positions of the sun and moon during the eclipse. The results were used to correct the tables and help fix the longitudes of various locations. The article also discusses the importance of accurate measurements for understanding celestial mechanics and geodesy.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
