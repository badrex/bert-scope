The results show that glucose significantly increases the production of 14CO2 from acetate and stimulates oxygen uptake in the presence of all three substrates. Glucose also affects the transformation of these substrates into amino acids, increasing glutamate and GABA formation while decreasing aspartate and alanine formation. Additionally, glucose increases lactate formation from pyruvate and alanine.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Metabolism"}
