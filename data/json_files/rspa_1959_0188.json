The study reveals the existence of an antiferromagnetic transition and provides insights into the interaction mechanisms between ions, such as electric quadrupole-quadrupole and dipole-dipole interactions. The findings contribute to a better understanding of cerium ethyl sulfate's behavior and potential applications in nuclear orientation work.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
