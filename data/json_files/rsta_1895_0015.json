They found that the ratio remains the same for monohalogen derivatives of one paraffin and is also the same as that of the parent hydrocarbon. The author also discussed the distribution of energy in molecules and the role of molecular configuration in determining heat capacity.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
