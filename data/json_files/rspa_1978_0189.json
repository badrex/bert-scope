The study reveals that roughness effects consist of two parts: one depends on the shape of the autocorrelation function, and the other does not. The results apply to any type of two-dimensional roughness and provide insights into the behavior of lubrication performance parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
