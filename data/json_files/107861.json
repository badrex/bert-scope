The author used a simple instrument to measure the heat evolved by different metals when an electrical charge passed through them. The results showed that the conducting power of metals varies, with silver and copper being the best conductors. The author also found that the conducting power of alloys is affected by the quantity of the inferior conductor present. This research helps to understand the relationship between metals and their ability to conduct electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
