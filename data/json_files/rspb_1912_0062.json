The results support the hypothesis that cholesterol from broken-down cells is utilized in the formation of new cells, and the liver plays a role in breaking down dead cells and eliminating their cholesterol in bile. The findings also show that the cholesterol content varies in different tissues and is affected by diet and nutritional state.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
