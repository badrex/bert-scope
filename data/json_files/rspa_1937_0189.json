They discovered the shape of the spectrum and found that the majority of emitted particles were thorium atoms. The study also observed the association between disintegration electrons and -rays, providing evidence for the branching of the thorium series at thorium C.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
