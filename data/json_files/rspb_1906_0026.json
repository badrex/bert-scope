They found that coat color in horses follows Mendelian inheritance patterns, with chestnut being a recessive trait and bay and brown being dominant traits. The study also showed that the presence or absence of black \"points\" (mane, tail, and legs) distinguishes chestnut from bay and brown horses.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
