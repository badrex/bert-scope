The authors analyze data from patients with frontal lobe lesions, functional neuroimaging, and psychometric studies in normal volunteers to understand the dissociation between mnemonic and other executive capacities. The study finds that patients with frontal damage have deficits in using strategies to improve performance in spatial working memory tasks and making extra-dimensional shifts due to a high-order failure of inhibition in attentional set-shifting paradigms.", "scientific_discipline": "Psychology > Cognitive Neuroscience"}
