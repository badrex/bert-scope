They discovered that the catalyzed reaction occurs at a lower temperature than the uncatalyzed decomposition. The authors also found that iodine catalyzes the decomposition of chloroform to a similar extent. The reaction is a homogeneous gaseous process, and the authors determined the order of the reaction and the activation energy.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
