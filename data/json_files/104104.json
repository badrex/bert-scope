He explained his method of rubbing iron bars and steel to give them magnetic properties and demonstrated its effectiveness with compass needles and artificial loadstones. This invention had the potential to improve sea navigation and other applications of magnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
