The authors determine the critical Taylor number, wavenumber, and waveform of the disturbances. They also observe the growth and decay of vortices as the Taylor number changes. The results are compared with theoretical values obtained from the integration of exact equations for the linear stability problem. The findings provide insights into the behavior of fluid dynamics in rotating systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
