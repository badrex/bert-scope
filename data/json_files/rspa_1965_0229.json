They found that the quantum yield of the photolysis increased in the presence of these substances. The researchers suggested that oxygen atoms formed in the primary photolysis step react with the added gas to form a hydroxyl radical, which then propagates a chain reaction. This discovery helps to understand the complex reactions occurring in the Earth's atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
