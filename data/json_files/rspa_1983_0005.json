The authors use an idealized equilibrium-gas approximation to obtain criteria for wave reflection at the contact surface separating the pure gas from the dusty-gas layer. They find that a shock wave stronger than the incident one is transmitted into the dusty-air layer, and the shock wave transmitted into free air is weakened by a rarefaction wave. The authors solve the equations of motion numerically using a modified random-choice method with an operator-splitting technique to analyze the flow's transient behavior and discuss the strengths of the initial and emergent shock waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
