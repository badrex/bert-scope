Although the primary goal of finding the coelacanth was not achieved, the expedition provided valuable data on the deep-sea fish fauna in the area. The study highlights the challenges of fishing in steep and rocky bottoms and the methods used to catch the fish, such as drop lines and specialized fishing gear.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Marine Biology"}
