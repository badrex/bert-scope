They found that the time it takes for colonies to reach a standard size follows a Gaussian distribution. The study also showed that the early appearance of large colonies in experiments with high inocula can be explained by the Gaussian distribution, suggesting that there is no need to assume different phenomena in different ranges of conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
