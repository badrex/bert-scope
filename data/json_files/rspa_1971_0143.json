They found that evaporation curves for liquid gold particles agree with Kelvin's theory, which relates vapor pressure to surface curvature. The study also revealed a \"kinked\" nature in the evaporation curves of solid gold particles, which was interpreted as the melting of the particles into liquid, leading to a difference in evaporation rates. This research confirmed Kelvin's theory and provided insights into the melting point depressions of small particles.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
