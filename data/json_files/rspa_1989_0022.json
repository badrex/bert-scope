The authors develop an adaptive algorithm that estimates system characteristics and applies the optimum control force to minimize synchronous vibration. The algorithm is tested on a rotor-bearing rig with a flexible shaft supported on oil-film bearings, using a single electromagnetic actuator for control. The study demonstrates the effectiveness of the algorithm in controlling both the stability threshold and the rotor's synchronous response.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
