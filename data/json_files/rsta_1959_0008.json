They demonstrate that the conventional Coulomb gauge theory can lead to difficulties, and propose a transformation to eliminate these issues. The study focuses on the electromagnetic field associated with radiative transitions of atoms and provides a method to treat non-relativistic radiation problems, which is in accordance with the correspondence principle and maintains the advantages of the Coulomb gauge."}
