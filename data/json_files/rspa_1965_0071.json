They measured the absorption coefficients and found four absorption peaks at different wavelengths. The study also investigated the single crystal reflexion spectrum and the ordinary refractive index, which helped in understanding the material's optical properties and its potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
