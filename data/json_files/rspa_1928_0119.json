The authors found that the photographic action varies more rapidly than 1/v^2 in the region of 200,000 volts and above. This research helps in understanding the efficiency of photographic plates in detecting high-speed electrons and comparing the intensities of electronic beams.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
