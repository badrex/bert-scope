They discovered that radon adheres to the walls of the diffusion apparatus, which affects the accuracy of the diffusion measurements. The authors found ways to overcome this adhesion challenge, enabling them to obtain accurate diffusion coefficients for radon gas mixtures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Gas diffusion"}
