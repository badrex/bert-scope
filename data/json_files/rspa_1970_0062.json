They use Kulikovskii and Slobodkina's method to analyze the stability of these flows and apply it to a self-similar flow behind a strong imploding shock. The study finds that all possible one-dimensional steady flows in radiation-gas-dynamics are locally stable near the sonic point.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
