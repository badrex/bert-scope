They find the potential at an outside point due to an ellipse and discuss the exhaustion of potential energy between two solid ellipsoids. The author also mentions the expansion of the potential in other shapes like parallelopipeds and rectangular circuits.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Analysis"}
