The results show that a fish oil diet significantly decreased erythrocyte deformability and increased osmotic fragility compared to other diets. Chlorpromazine's antihaemolytic effect was also affected by the type of dietary oil, with safflower and linseed oil diets decreasing the concentration at which the effect reversed to prohaemolytic. The study highlights the importance of dietary lipids in modulating the effects of chlorpromazine on red cell membrane properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
