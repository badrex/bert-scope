They found that the decay periods of phosphorescence vary widely among different materials, from microseconds to hours or days. The study also explored the connection between luminescence and photoconductivity, and the optical energy levels in solids. The results provide insights into the mechanisms involved in luminescence processes and the role of impurities in phosphorescent materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid-state physics"}
