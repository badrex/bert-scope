The research finds that prolonged darkness leads to changes in retinula screening pigment granules and rhabdom organization, while exposure to light results in different changes in the eye structure. The study also discusses the behavior and morphology of the isopod species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
