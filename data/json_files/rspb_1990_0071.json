The pupil mechanism, consisting of pigment granules, migrates towards the rhabdom in the light and absorbs extra-rhabdomal light. This mechanism affects higher-order waveguide modes more strongly, reducing the acceptance angle of each ommatidium and potentially improving resolution. The authors measured the extent and timecourse of this change using optical and electrophysiological methods, showing that these changes are important for butterflies during natural flight.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Ophthalmology"}
