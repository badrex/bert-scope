The study investigates the effects of alkylation on colony-forming ability and phage-synthetic capacity of E. coli strain B and its mutants. The corrected text suggests that ribonucleic acids may be the reactive substrate essential for capacity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
