They found that serum-globulin has an isoelectric point of approximately pH 4.54 and a zone of insolubility between pH 4.5 and 6.5. This study provides a better understanding of serum-globulin's properties and its behavior in different pH conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Protein chemistry"}
