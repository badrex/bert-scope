The study found that interferon enhances macrophage spreading and increases the surface area of macrophages. Additionally, it was discovered that interferon increases the expression of HLA-A, B, and G surface antigens in human cell lines. The results support the idea that interferon activates macrophages and influences their surface properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
