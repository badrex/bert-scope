The authors examine the rates of hydration of individual cement phases, their disappearance from the microstructure, and the formation of hydration products. The study reveals new insights into the mechanisms of cement hydration and provides a better understanding of the material's setting and hardening processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
