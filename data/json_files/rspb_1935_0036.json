They found that intracerebral implantation allowed for the formation of large masses of growing tissues in a high proportion of treated animals. The results showed that the implanted tissues could differentiate into various types of cells and tissues, including bone, cartilage, muscle, and glandular tissue.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
