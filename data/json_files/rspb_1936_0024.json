The research found that the fungus significantly reduces the timber's strength, toughness, and elasticity, causing a \"brash\" fracture. The findings highlight the importance of understanding and managing fungal decay in timber to maintain its structural integrity and durability.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Wood Science"}
