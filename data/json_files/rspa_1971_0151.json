They found significant differences in behavior between positive and negative point discharges and discovered a complex discharge structure with strong liquid wave disturbances. The study provides insights into the mechanisms responsible for flashovers in high voltage outdoor insulators and helps in finding remedies for them.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
