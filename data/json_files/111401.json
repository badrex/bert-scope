He found that ozone, considered an allotropic form of oxygen, has a density nearly four times that of regular oxygen. The experiments involved measuring the change in volume of a gaseous mixture containing ozone when exposed to a specific temperature and analyzing the contents using a method described in a previous communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atmospheric Chemistry"}
