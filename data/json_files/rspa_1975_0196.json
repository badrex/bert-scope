The authors found that at low Reynolds numbers, the effective hydrodynamic length is much larger than the length of the orifice's constant diameter. They also discovered that the inertia force correction factor increases rapidly at a certain Reynolds number range and then reaches a plateau value. The study shows that within the admissible range of Reynolds numbers, the mean rate of shear can be derived from the Poiseuille equation, allowing for quantitative measurements of temporary viscosity reduction.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
