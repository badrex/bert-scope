The research focuses on the chondrocranium, jaws, hyobranchial skeleton, ossifications, cranial and anterior spinal nerves, musculature, blood system, and other anatomical features. The findings support the concept of segmental organization in the vertebrate head and provide insights into the evolution of air-breathing tetrapods from aquatic ancestors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
