The authors conclude that adsorption primarily occurs through unionized molecules. They also discuss the motion of electrons in a Coulombian field and the impact of nuclear spin on the behavior of substances. The study provides insights into the relationship between nuclear spin and the optical properties of materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
