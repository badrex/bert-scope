Four charcoals with varying activity levels were tested at different temperatures, and the results showed that all charcoals exhibited similar behavior. The study provides insights into the adsorption and desorption processes, contributing to the understanding of adsorption hysteresis and the development of future adsorption theories.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Surface Chemistry"}
