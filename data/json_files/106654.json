He discovered that the stamina of various plants, including Barberry, exhibit a high degree of irritability, which allows them to contract when touched. This phenomenon helps in the pollination process, as it ensures that pollen comes into contact with the stigma. The author also observed similar irritability and movement in other plants, such as Cactus Tuna, Dionaea muscipula, Mimosa, and Drosera.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
