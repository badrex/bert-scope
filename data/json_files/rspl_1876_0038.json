They used a dip-circle with two needles to record the mean results of the observations. Additionally, the author investigated electrical displacement in non-conductors, such as glass and copper, by lifting them without friction and analyzing the resulting charge. This research provided data for determining the approximate values of the secular change of the magnetic element and the direction of isoclinal lines."}
