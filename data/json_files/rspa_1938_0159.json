The authors tested Pohlhausen's equation, which calculates the temperature taken up by a flat plate placed in an air stream, by conducting experiments in a wind tunnel. They found that the equation holds true for laminar flow and that the temperature difference between the plate and the air stream is directly proportional to the square of the wind speed. The results also showed that the equation can be applied to other shaped bodies, such as aerofoils, with some modifications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
