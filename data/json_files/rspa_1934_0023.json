They found that the refractive indices of cyclohexene are lower than expected, while the indices of 1:3-cyclohexadiene are in accordance with the assumption of equal increments of refractive indices due to double bonds. The study provides insights into the optical properties and molecular structure of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
