It demonstrates that when a metal is dipped into an electrolyte, a double layer is established, and the initial rate of dissolution is calculated. The article also discusses how dielectric properties of the electrolyte affect the dissolution process and how the strength of the double layer and its formation time are estimated.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
