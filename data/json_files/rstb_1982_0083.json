The research reveals that frontal-lobe lesions can cause impairments in tasks involving motor differentiation, oculomotor control, and the monitoring of temporal sequences of events. The left frontal lobe appears to play a major role in planning and programming voluntary actions, while the right frontal lobe is more involved in monitoring the temporal sequence of externally ordered events.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuropsychology"}
