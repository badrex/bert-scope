The study found that both imaging systems were highly sensitive and specific in detecting arterial disease and provided valuable information about vessel wall dynamics and distensibility. These findings can help in early recognition and treatment of high-risk groups with extracranial arterial disease to prevent stroke.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Vascular Medicine"}
