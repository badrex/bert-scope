The researchers found that the extracted antigen elicited direct hypersensitivity reactions in specifically presensitized MHA hamsters but was incapable of inciting transplantation immunity in normal MHA hosts. However, when emulsified in complete Freund's adjuvant, the material was immunogenic, leading to accelerated rejection of subsequent test tumor or skin homografts. The study also explored the effects of chronic treatment with antigenic material on MHA hamsters, inducing a high degree of tolerance in respect of subsequent homografts of CB skin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
