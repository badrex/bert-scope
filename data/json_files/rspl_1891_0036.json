The author explains the phenomena of repulsion and rotation using the concepts of self-induction and phase lag in secondary currents. The experiments conducted by Professor Elihu Thomson are analyzed, and the author calculates the force and couple intensities in various cases. The article also debunks the misconception that a copper plate acts as a screen and causes unsymmetrical fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
