The algal endosymbiont, Cymnodinium microadriaticum, has a circadian rhythm in photosynthetic efficiency, with maxima at sunrise and sunset and a minimum at local solar noon. The host coral's calcification capacity mirrors these changes, allowing it to maximize calcification during a significant portion of the day. The findings provide insights into the true environmental rates of primary production and calcification in corals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Coral Biology"}
