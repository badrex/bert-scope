They found that the neural tube consists of a mosaic of regions with a fixed tendency to develop into specific parts of the nervous system. The authors also discovered that the axial polarity of the retino-tectal projection is determined within the early neural tube, but the polarity for selective nerve connections remains labile. This research provides insights into the developmental processes of the nervous system and the mechanisms underlying the formation of specific synaptic connections.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
