The method of superposition is used to solve the biharmonic equation for the stream function, providing accurate results for the velocity field and local structure near corners and points of discontinuity. The amplitudes of Moffatt's eddies, positions of separation points, and angles of inclination are also determined.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
