The species has an annual life cycle, with adults dying after spawning and their place taken by the new generation of juvenile dorids. The research provides a detailed analysis of the natural history, embryology, larval biology, and post-larval development of A. proxima, including the complex arrangement of embryonic body cavities and the two distinct stages of the pelagic phase. The findings challenge the widely held views on torsion in opisthobranchs and provide insights into the evolution of gastropods.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
