This technique is useful for determining the positions of atoms in a crystal structure and can be applied in various situations, such as when the atomic positions are approximately known, the configuration of the molecule is known but not its orientation, or the general molecular shape is known but not the details. The authors also discuss other methods, like the relaxation method and the least squares refinement, and compare their advantages and limitations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
