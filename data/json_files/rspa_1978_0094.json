The experiments reveal that nitrogen aggregates partially dissociate, producing single substitutional nitrogen atoms. The results provide insights into the relative stability of A and nitrogen centers and contribute to understanding the formation of different types of nitrogen aggregates in diamonds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
