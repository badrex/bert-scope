Ross found that the variation was less at anchor in the West-India Islands than at sea, which led him to question the cause of this phenomenon. The observations were communicated to Mr. William Mountain, F.R.S., who shared them with the Royal Society.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
