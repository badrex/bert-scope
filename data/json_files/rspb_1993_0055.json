The calls' frequency varies seasonally and is affected by age, site, and month. Infants' echolocation frequencies are correlated with their mothers', suggesting a combination of genetic and learning factors in determining the frequency. The findings provide insights into the development and adaptation of bat echolocation calls.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
