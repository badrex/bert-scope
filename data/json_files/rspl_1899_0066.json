The authors determined the freezing points of mixtures with varying compositions and analyzed the alloys' properties. They identified seven substances in the solid alloys and three eutectic points. The research also examines the microstructure of the alloys using microscopy and Rontgen rays, revealing the patterns and structures of the different components.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Material Science and Metallurgy"}
