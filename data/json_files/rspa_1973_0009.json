They found that the one-dimensional flame equations could not accurately predict the properties of flames with thicker reaction zones, and suggested that two-dimensional effects may play a larger role in these systems. The study provides insights into the behavior of low-pressure flames and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
