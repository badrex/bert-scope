The research focuses on the frequency response of Reynolds stresses and structural changes in turbulence, including the modulation of correlation coefficients and quadrant distribution. The findings reveal three distinct imposed frequency regimes and provide insights into the interaction between the basic flow and turbulence under unsteady conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
