The instrument uses a thin piece of sponge, cut to have a large surface area, which hangs by a fine silk thread and is balanced by another thread of silk with lead shot. The index points to a graduated scale, allowing for precise measurement of air moisture.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
