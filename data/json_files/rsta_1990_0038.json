It explores various areas of Africa where solar signals may be present and discusses the mechanisms behind these effects. The authors propose that changes in solar activity, particularly in its corpuscular and electromagnetic aspects, can impact global climate through interactions between the low ionosphere and high troposphere. This can lead to either a 'cold global situation' with more frequent droughts or a 'warm global situation' with a more expansive monsoon.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate Science"}
