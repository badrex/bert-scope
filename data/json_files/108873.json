He explains the principles of fluid flow past a solid body and how water-line curves can be used to determine good forms of water-line for ships. The author also discusses the properties of neoids generated by a circle and their geometrical meaning.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
