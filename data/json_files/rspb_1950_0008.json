They found that these substances promote both longitudinal and lateral extension in root segments. The study also showed that the activity of these substances is destroyed by heat and decreases during storage, suggesting they may be carbohydrates or simple derivatives.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
