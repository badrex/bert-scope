The study focuses on the infinite slab and cylinder geometries, considering both Dirichlet and Robin boundary conditions. The authors explore the dependences of temperature and concentration profiles on various parameters and the number of possible steady-state solutions, ranging from one to five, depending on the geometry and boundary conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
