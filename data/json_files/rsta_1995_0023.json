The corrections involve adjustments to figures and descriptions related to mass/charge spectra, ion speeds, and velocity distributions of solar wind and interstellar ions. The authors highlight the preferential acceleration of non-thermal pick-up ions and the presence of power law tails in their speed distributions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Solar Physics"}
