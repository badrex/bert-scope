The authors found that a single layer of lubricant can significantly reduce friction, but the film wears away quickly. For effective boundary lubrication, a layer of lubricant several molecules thick is necessary. The frictional behavior of lubricated surfaces is largely governed by the extent to which the lubricant film breaks down during sliding.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Tribology"}
