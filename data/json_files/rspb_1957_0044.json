They found that the most abundant form of vitamin A in these species was the hindered isomer, neo-b vitamin A, which constituted 63-90% of the total vitamin A. Another hindered cis-isomer, neo-c vitamin A, was also detected in the extracts of Meganyctiphanes norvegica and Thysanoessa raschii. The calculated biological activities of these mixtures of isomers agreed well with the results of biological assays with rats. The authors discuss the significance of these findings in relation to the vitamin A food chain in the sea and suggest that predators of these Crustacea can convert neo-b vitamin A into all-trans form.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
