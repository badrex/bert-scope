They investigate the flux of ions in ionic crystals containing Schottky defects and provide equations for the rate of migration and deformation of the crystal. This theory can be applied to processes like sintering, pressure sintering, and diffusion-controlled creep in ionic materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
