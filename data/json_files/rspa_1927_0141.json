They found that gold surfaces acquired a negative charge when in contact with hydrogen or carbonic oxide, and a positive charge when in contact with oxygen alone. This research provides insights into the mechanism and nature of heterogeneous catalysis of gaseous reactions by hot surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
