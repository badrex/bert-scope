The study reveals that the phenomenon is due to interaction in aggregates of differently altered, but homologous, gene products, and that the site of interaction is in the protein forming the enzyme itself. The research helps to understand the relationships among histidine mutants and their genetic loci, contributing to the knowledge of gene interaction and complementation in Neurospora crassa.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
