They find that the eyes become less sensitive to the dominant wavelength of the adapting light, leading to changes in the appearance of colours. This can assist in colour discrimination and explains why certain colours may be difficult to see under artificial light. The study also shows that colour adaptation occurs both immediately and after longer exposure to the adapting light.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Psychology and Neuroscience"}
