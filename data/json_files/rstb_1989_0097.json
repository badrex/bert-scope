They argue that impacts by asteroids and comets are plausible candidates due to their common occurrence throughout the Phanerozoic era and their global effects on atmospheric chemistry and other environmental factors. The author emphasizes the importance of stratigraphic data in evaluating extinction mechanisms and highlights the need for new methods to cope with range truncation issues.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
