They find that platinum films favor reaction I, producing ammonia and ethane, while nickel, palladium, and gold films favor reaction II, producing ammonia, diethylamine, and triethylamine. The authors also discuss the effect of temperature and pressure on the reaction rates and propose reaction mechanisms for the observed processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
