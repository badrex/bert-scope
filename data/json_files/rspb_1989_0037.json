The research reveals that Sphagnum has an effective internal transport system, allowing it to retain and relocate solutes efficiently. This, along with its ability to grow in low nutrient conditions and create an acidic environment, contributes to its widespread success in various ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
