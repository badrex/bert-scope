They found that the sodium-potassium pump in liver cells is electrogenic, contributing to the membrane potential and playing a significant role in potassium uptake. The presence of Strophanthin-G, a sodium-potassium pump inhibitor, confirmed the electrogenic nature of the pump.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
