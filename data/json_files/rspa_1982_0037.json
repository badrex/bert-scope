By appending a set of subsidiary equations to the Hamilton-like equations of geometrical optics, the associated intensity can be computed along each ray as it is traced. This method is applicable to various forms of wave propagation and extends to dispersive anisotropic systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
