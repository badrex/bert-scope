This process is important for understanding how the heart's pump activity is regulated and controlled. The study suggests that adrenalin and ATP may play a role in circulatory control by providing a rapid boost of cardiac activity before the slower, more sustained P-catecholamine action.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
