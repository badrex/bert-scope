The theorem provides a formula for the frequency derivative of the input reactance, which consists of five terms representing different physical attributes of the system, such as stored magnetic and electric energy, radiation, dispersion, and dissipation. The theorem applies to systems containing dissipative media and those that radiate, making it more comprehensive than previous formulations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electromagnetic Theory"}
