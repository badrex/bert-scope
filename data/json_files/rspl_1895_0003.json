They used a Brockie-Pell arc lamp and a radio-micrometer to measure the radiation from the carbons and the Sun. They found that the effective temperature of the carbons in the electric arc and the Sun can be calculated using a formula that takes into account the radiation, temperature, and emissive power of the surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
