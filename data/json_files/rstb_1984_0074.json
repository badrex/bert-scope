Acidification, caused by deposited sulfur and nitrogen compounds, has led to a major perturbation in aquatic ecosystems, resulting in regional loss of fish populations. The decline in fish stocks has been documented in thousands of lakes, rivers, and coastal areas. The article reviews the chronology of this decline, possible causes, and mechanisms, emphasizing the need for countermeasures to restore and rescue valuable freshwater fish resources.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Freshwater Ecosystems and Pollution"}
