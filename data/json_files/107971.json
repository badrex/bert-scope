{"article_id": "107971", "revised_title": "Pendulum Corrections and Anomalies in Experiments", "semantic_tags": ["Pendulum experiments", "Gravity", "Vacuum", "Scientific instruments", "Measurement"], "tldr": "The author discusses the importance of accurate pendulum experiments and the need for corrections to account for anomalies in their results. They describe their experiments with various pendulums and propose a new method for determining the correction for the reduction to a vacuum, which involves swinging the pendulum in a vacuum. The author also describes their vacuum apparatus and the importance of comparing results from different pendulums to determine the true length of the seconds pendulum.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
