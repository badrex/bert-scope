They used a combination of photographic methods and ionization chamber measurements to compare the relative intensities of the beta-ray groups for equal numbers of disintegrating atoms. The results confirmed some values of Ellis and Aston for RaB lines and Gurney's value for the ratio of the H line of RaB to the F line of ThB. The study also suggested that Gurney's values for the lines G and F of RaB were in error.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
