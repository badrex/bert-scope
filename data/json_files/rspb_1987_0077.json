The research describes all sensilla and associated structures identified by electron microscopy, focusing on the hairplates associated with the antennae and neck region. The study discusses the structure and function of these sensory structures in walking, proprioceptive control of posture, and gravity detection, as well as their role in detecting and measuring host curvature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
