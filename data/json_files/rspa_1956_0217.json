They interpreted the results in terms of the dipole moment derivatives and found that the effective C-H bond moment for in-plane bending is different from that for out-of-plane bending. The study provides insight into the nature of carbon-hydrogen bonds in hydrocarbons.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
