They explore the Heisenberg picture to develop a physical model of particle dynamics, finding that particles roam about a spherical shell that pulsates with the passage of time. The model provides a reference point for defining orbital angular momentum and leads to zero spin for all momentum values.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
