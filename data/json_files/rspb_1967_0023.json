They discovered that an enzyme, likely an exonuclease, is responsible for the release of damaged DNA components during the delay in DNA synthesis. This process helps the bacteria to survive high doses of X-rays and repair the damage to their DNA.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
