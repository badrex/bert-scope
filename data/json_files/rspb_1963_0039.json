The results show that the rate of CO2 output increases and then decreases when potatoes are exposed to oxygen at pressures of 2 or 3 atm at 15\u00b0C. The author suggests that this increase in CO2 output is due to a pathway other than the tricarboxylic acid cycle and may be related to a shortage of sugar phosphate substrates caused by oxygen inhibition of cytochrome-c reductase.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
