The authors describe the metabolism and actions of inositol metabolites, particularly inositol phosphate isomers, and their relation to intracellular calcium homeostasis. They also explore the use of pharmacological reagents to intervene in the signaling sequence and the potential roles of inositol polyphosphates, InsP5, and InsP6 in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
