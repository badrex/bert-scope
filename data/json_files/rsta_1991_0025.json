It explains how the theory separates localized and extended states in disordered metals, leading to a two-component Fermi liquid model. The author presents several predictions and experimental evidence supporting the theory's validity in understanding the electronic structure and superconductivity of layered cuprates.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
