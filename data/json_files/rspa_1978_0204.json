The researchers found that the East African plateau and the highland region around the rift valley, known as the Kenya dome, have different compensation mechanisms. The dome is supported by a region of the mantle with low density, low seismic velocity, and high electrical conductivity, likely due to partial melting. The study provides valuable insights into the geology and tectonic processes of East Africa.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
