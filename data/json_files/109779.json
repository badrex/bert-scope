He found that the Cassegrainian telescope had a superior power of illumination, which could be due to the avoidance of light interference in the principal focus. This discovery could make the Cassegrainian telescope a valuable option for astronomical observations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Optics"}
