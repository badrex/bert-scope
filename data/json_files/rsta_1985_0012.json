The electrical resistivity of chain compounds decreases with decreasing temperature, while the layered compounds exhibit metallic behavior from 300 to 1.4 K. The anisotropy in resistivity and the Fermi surface model provide insights into the unique structure and conduction properties of these compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Condensed Matter Physics"}
