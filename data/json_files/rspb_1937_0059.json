The authors present evidence for and against both chemical and electrical hypotheses, suggesting that a combination of factors, including the properties of neuromuscular junctions and the presence of chemical substances, play a role in the transmission of excitation and muscle contraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
