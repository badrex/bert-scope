They found that the rate of polymerization depends on catalyst concentration and composition, with an optimal catalyst ratio of 2:1. The rate of polymerization is independent of the amount of aluminum trimethyl present over a wide range of alkyl concentration. The molecular weights of the polymers were determined based on reaction conditions using a viscometric procedure.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Chemistry"}
