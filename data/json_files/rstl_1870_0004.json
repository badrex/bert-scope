The text explores the concepts of -fold relations, plexuses, spaces, and loci, as well as the composition and aggregation of relations. This work contributes to the understanding of mathematical analysis and the representation of complex relations between quantities.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Geometry"}
