They found that a critical potential of 17 volts is required for the reaction to occur, and two well-defined breaks at 17 volts and 23 volts were observed. The results suggest that the reaction is not solely due to ionization or dissociation of the reacting gases but involves a complex electrical process.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
