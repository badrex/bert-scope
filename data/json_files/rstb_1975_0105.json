The results showed that pale cells, which are early erythroid cells, had lower iron counts than mature cells. This indicates that these cells are in the early stages of erythropoiesis, supporting the theory that erythropoiesis occurs in situ in the avian thymus.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
