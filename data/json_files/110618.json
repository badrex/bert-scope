This method was applied to various salts, leading to the determination of equivalent numbers for chlorine, nitrogen, potassium, and sodium, which supported Dr. Turner's views and challenged the hypothesis that all equivalent numbers are simple multiples of hydrogen's equivalent number.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
