They found that two types of microtexture exist for different regions of anomalous growth within the same specimen. The grain-boundary textural data show that boundaries between small grains have a higher proportion of special boundaries, which are of lower energy and higher mobility. This suggests that anomalous growth may stagnate due to the lower energy boundaries surrounding small grains. The authors also suggest that the definition of grain growth should be extended to include both grain-boundary textural rearrangements and grain-boundary migration for energy minimization.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Grain Growth and Texture"}
