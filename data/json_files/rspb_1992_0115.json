The model considers the disc as a thick cylindrical shell enclosing the nucleus, with the annulus fibrosus contributing equally to the axial compression. The model's predictions align with published experimental data, suggesting that the pressure vessel accounts for the radial composition within the disc and helps it withstand compression.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomechanics"}
