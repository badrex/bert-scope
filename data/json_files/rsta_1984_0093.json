The inner core, with a radius of about 1,230 km, is believed to have a high electrical conductivity, which may influence the main magnetic field. The study suggests that the inner core could be responsible for the slow precession of the dipole part of the geomagnetic field, which has been observed in historical and paleomagnetic records. The research also discusses the torques acting on the inner core, such as electromagnetic, inertial, and gravity torques, and their impact on the inner core's rotational dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
