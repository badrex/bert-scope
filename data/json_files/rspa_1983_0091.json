The first Born approximation is used to analyze the scattering wavefunction, and the results show that attractive potentials enhance particle density in one and two dimensions, inhibit it in three dimensions, and have a marginal effect in other cases. The study also highlights the importance of the potential's behavior at the origin and the use of Bessel functions in the calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
