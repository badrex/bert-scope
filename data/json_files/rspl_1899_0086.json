The experiments found that bacteria, including the highly resistant spores of B. anthracis, could survive exposure to -182\u00b0C to -190\u00b0C for twenty hours without any impairment of their vitality. Additionally, photogenic bacteria maintained their luminous properties after being cooled and then thawed. The study also demonstrated that bacteria can survive in liquefied laboratory air at -210\u00b0C.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
