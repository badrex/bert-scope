W. Hofmann, studied the reaction between cyanate of ethyl and urea, resulting in the formation of a new crystalline compound. This compound contains two molecules of ethyl-cyanic acid instead of the usual one molecule found in other urea reactions. The new substance is soluble in alcohol, ether, and dilute acids, and its formation reveals the diatomic character of urea.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
