They discovered that propylene inhibits the reaction, while nitric oxide does not, suggesting that both inhibitors can largely suppress the chain reaction, leaving a residual reaction of non-chain nature. The acetone chain reaction is found to be of the first order, and the results indicate that the mean chain length in the acetone chain decomposition is less than in other decompositions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
