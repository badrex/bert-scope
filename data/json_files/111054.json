The research shows that common salt, sugar, and urea diffuse away from albumen, while albumen has a low diffusibility. The findings also reveal that isomorphous compounds have equal diffusibility, and that chemical decompositions can be produced by liquid diffusion. This research provides a new method of separation or analysis for many soluble bodies, similar to the process of distillation."}
