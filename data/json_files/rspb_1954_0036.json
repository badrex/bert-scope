It shows that the concentration of antitoxin in the foetal serum varies depending on the species in which the antitoxin was produced. The entry of rabbit antitoxin into the foetal circulation increases with foetal age and decreases thereafter. This selective admission by the foetal membranes is crucial for the development and protection of the unborn rabbit.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
