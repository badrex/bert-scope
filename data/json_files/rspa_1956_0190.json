G. W. Norrish and M. H. Searby. They studied the reaction mechanisms and quantum yields of the decomposition in two solvents, carbon tetrachloride and n-hexane. The authors found that the main products of the decomposition depend on the solvent used, and they discussed the technical challenges they faced during their experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
