It explores the validity of the -plane approximation, which assumes that the spherical surface can be locally approximated by a plane surface while considering the latitudinal variation of the Coriolis parameter. The study shows that the -plane approximation is generally valid, but it may not be sufficient in certain regions near wave caustics. The article also examines planetary wave motions in enclosed basins on a sphere and discusses the possibility of simpler, non-divergent motions in closed basins.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
