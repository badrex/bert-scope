It shows that modulation destabilizes the flow and alters the critical Reynolds number, even for large modulation amplitudes. The study provides insights into the behavior of flows with time-periodic instabilities and has implications for understanding turbulence in pulsatile blood flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
