They explain the construction and operation of the apparatus, which uses a quartz crystal oscillator and a resonance circuit with a thermo-junction for detecting resonance. This method is suitable for measuring dielectric constants of solutions and has proven useful in various experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
