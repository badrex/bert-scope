They find that the oxidation of protein, likely by tyrosinase, is crucial for the rapid adsorption of the protein at the surface and the membrane's stability. The process is mainly confined to the liquid system, and the membrane's formation can be modulated by changes in oxygen pressure or temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
