The study found that the main difference between species lies in proboscis length relative to body size, and within species, sexual dimorphism is associated with differences in abdomen width. The research used multivariate techniques, such as canonical variates analysis and principal components analysis, to identify the major axes of variation within and between species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
