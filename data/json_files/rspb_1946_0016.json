They found that the meridional arcs in X-ray diagrams, previously thought to represent transversely oriented cellulose chains, were actually spurious. The authors also suggested that the ray tissue contributes to the meridional arcs. The study concluded that the tracheid wall is uniform in cellulose chain direction, and the optical and swelling heterogeneity should be sought in variations of some other property.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Biology"}
