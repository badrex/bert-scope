They found that sweat contains various elements like chlorine, potassium, and sulfate, and organic compounds like lactic acid. The concentration of these compounds varies depending on factors such as body temperature, physical activity, and individual differences. The study provides insights into human physiology and body temperature regulation during exercise and sweating.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
