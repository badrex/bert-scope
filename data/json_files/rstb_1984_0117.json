The authors describe the characterization of antigens from Plasmodium yoelii and P. falciparum, which may play a role in inducing protective immunity in the host. They also explore the potential use of these antigens in developing a vaccine against falciparum malaria.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
