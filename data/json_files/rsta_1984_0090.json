The author discovers that Hyperion's spin has likely evolved to a value comparable to its orbital mean motion. The study also reveals that the orientation of the spin axis normal to the orbit plane is unstable for all chaotic rotation and libration about synchronous and half-synchronous rotation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Celestial Mechanics"}
