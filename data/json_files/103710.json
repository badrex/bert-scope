He found that the villi in oxen are much larger than in humans, allowing for a detailed examination of their structure. He also observed that the internal surface of the oxen's stomach is covered by a production of the cuticle, which he believes is also present in humans. Price sent a piece of the oxen's stomach with filled vessels and raised cuticle to support his findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
