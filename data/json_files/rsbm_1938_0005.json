His research on cement led to the identification of essential compounds in Portland cement and the understanding of the setting process. Le Chatelier also developed a new method for measuring high temperatures using thermo-electric couples and made important discoveries in the field of chemical equilibrium, now known as Le Chatelier's principle.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Equilibrium"}
