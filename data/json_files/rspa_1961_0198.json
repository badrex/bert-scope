The twins are regions misoriented from the crystal by a rotation of about a direction in the basal plane, and the twin boundaries are shown to be simple tilt boundaries of a particular angle. The dislocation structure of the twin boundary is deduced, and the effect of twins on the mechanical properties of graphite crystals is considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
