They discovered that the bright lines in the spectrum were broad and difficult to measure accurately. The author found a connection between the lines in Nova Persei's spectrum and the enhanced lines of iron in other stars, suggesting a similarity in their spectra. This study provided insights into the nature of Novae and their relationship to other stars.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrophysics"}
