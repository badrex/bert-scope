The author presents the results of various eclipse observations and spectroscopic measurements, highlighting the challenges and uncertainties in interpreting the data. The article concludes that while the tests generally support Einstein's theory of relativity, further observations and advancements in measurement techniques are needed for a more definitive conclusion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Relativity"}
