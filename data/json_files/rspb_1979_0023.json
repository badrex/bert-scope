The invading Bdellovibrio degrades and consumes the host's cellular constituents, eventually causing the host cell to lyse and release the Bdellovibrio progeny. The article also describes the various steps in the parasite-host interactions, including attachment, penetration, and the formation of bdelloplasts.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
