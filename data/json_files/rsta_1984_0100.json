The authors explain how the strong coupling between transverse excitons and the electromagnetic radiation field leads to polaritons, which cause changes in the refractive index. They also describe the theoretical model used to calculate the dispersion of a three-level system and the experimental setup for observing optical bistability. The results show that the nonlinear refractive index is comparable to that found in GaAs.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
