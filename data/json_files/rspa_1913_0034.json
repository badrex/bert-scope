The authors describe their experimental setup and findings, which support the kinetic theory of gases and provide insights into the behavior of electrons in different gas environments. They also discuss the effects of water vapor and impurities on electron motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
