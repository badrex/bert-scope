He discusses its anatomy, including its teeth structure, head, and the two sacculi or marsupia on its sides. He also explains the fish's feeding behavior and how it allures other fish to approach. Parsons suggests that the sacculi may serve as a receptacle for the young until they are able to survive on their own. Lastly, he debates whether the Rana Piscatrix is oviparous or viviparous, as there is disagreement among authors on this topic.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ichthyology"}
