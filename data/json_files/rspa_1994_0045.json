They find chaotic behavior, characterized by a positive Lyapunov exponent, through period-doubling bifurcations, Melnikov sequence of subharmonic bifurcations, and homoclinic crossings. Theoretical analysis and numerical solutions are presented to support their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Nonlinear Dynamics"}
