They discovered that both molecules have an obtuse-angled triangular structure with a vertical angle of approximately 120 degrees. The study also found that the molecules' heat of dissociation and force constants are closely related to their position in the periodic table.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
