They found that the rate of conversion decreases with increasing temperature below 77K, while it increases with temperature above 77K. The process exhibits a 'negative activation energy' of 1080 cal at low temperatures, suggesting that the catalysis is due to interaction between hydrogen molecules and magnetic dipoles in zinc oxide. A mixture of zinc oxide and the solid free radical picryl hydrazyl proved to be a more efficient catalyst for the para-hydrogen conversion and the hydrogen-deuterium exchange reaction at low temperatures. The authors propose an electron-transfer process between the surfaces of the two solids to explain this phenomenon.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
