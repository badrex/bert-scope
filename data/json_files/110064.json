He proposes a new theory called \"semi-decussation,\" in which the optic nerves partially cross over each other, supplying each eye with fibers from both the right and left thalami. This theory explains the sympathy between corresponding points in the eyes and provides a better understanding of how our vision works with two eyes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroanatomy"}
