They demonstrate that the error rate due to interaction with the environment grows exponentially with the number of qubits, making the algorithm inefficient. The paper discusses the need for modifications and improvements in both theoretical and experimental aspects to make quantum computation practical.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Quantum Mechanics"}
