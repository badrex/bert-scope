The author presents experiments conducted at the National Physical Laboratory to determine the accuracy of the Kew Scale in relation to the hydrogen scale. The study involves the calibration and comparison of several mercury thermometers, aiming to improve temperature measurements and their reference to the standard thermometric scale.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
