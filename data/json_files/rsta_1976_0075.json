The authors review the progressive growth of folds by buckling in single and multilayer models compressed parallel to the layering and demonstrate how fold geometries vary based on viscosity contrasts. They also examine the development of stresses around folds and discuss the implications for future research in the field.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
