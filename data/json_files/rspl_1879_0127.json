They used different methods and processes to obtain precise results and minimize errors. The general mean of all the experiments resulted in an atomic weight of aluminium of 27.032, with a probable error of +0.045. This research adds aluminium to the limited list of elements with atomic weights determined with high precision.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic Theory"}
