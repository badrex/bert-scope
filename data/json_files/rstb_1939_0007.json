They found that the apparent shape of the chromosome is an external form of a spiral coil, which has significant implications for understanding chromosome behavior. The study provides detailed observations and measurements of the chromosomes, contributing to the knowledge of spiral structure in cytology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Botany"}
