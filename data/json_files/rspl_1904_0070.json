They found that the configuration of the hexose and the enzyme has a close relationship, and the enzyme and hexose likely combine together in some intimate manner. This research helps to understand the specific action of enzymes on hexoses and their products.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
