The authors use continuous-flow uniform reaction cells and develop a mathematical model system that allows for the rapid examination of different mechanisms. The methods enable chemists to alter hypothetical reaction mechanisms and set up verifying experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
