They found that during the induction period, ethanol is converted quantitatively into acetaldehyde and hydrogen peroxide. The pressure then begins to rise autocatalytically, and methanol, formaldehyde, and carbon monoxide become detectable. The study also explores the influence of reactant pressures and the effect of the surface on the reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
