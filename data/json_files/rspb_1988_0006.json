The research found that at least two GABA molecules are required to activate the chloride channel, and it detected differences between vertebrate GABAa receptors and insect neuronal GABA receptors. The study also provides evidence for a benzodiazepine site on an insect GABA-receptor-chloride-channel complex.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology and Neuropharmacology"}
