The model includes geostrophic frontal dynamics, quasigeostrophic evolution of the underlying slope water, and baroclinic vortex-tube stretching. The author analyzes the linear and nonlinear stability of the model, providing a comprehensive understanding of the stability characteristics of density-driven currents and fronts in coastal regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
