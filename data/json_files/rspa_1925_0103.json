The author investigates the 27-day interval in both magnetic and solar phenomena, analyzing data from 1920 to 1924. The results show no significant correlation between the solar constant and the 27-day interval in terrestrial magnetism, suggesting that solar phenomena causing magnetic intervals on Earth are not represented in daily solar constant figures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
