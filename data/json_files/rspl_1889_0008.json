They used various methods, including comparing the weights of gold and silver deposited by the same electric current and comparing the volume of hydrogen liberated by the same current from dilute sulfuric acid. The author found that the atomic weight of gold is approximately 196.9, with some variations depending on the experimental series.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Analytical Chemistry"}
