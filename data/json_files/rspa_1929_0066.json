The author, Sydney Goldstein, and co-author H. Jeffreys, derive equations of motion and discuss the drag force on a body moving with uniform velocity through a fluid. They also consider the lift force and the effect of non-steady motion. The study is based on Oseen's approximation, which assumes that the velocity of disturbance is small and terms depending on its square are neglected.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
