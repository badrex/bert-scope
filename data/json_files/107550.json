The new method involves using shorter and less curved timber pieces, replacing chocks with dowels, and better connecting the lower timbers for increased support. This innovative approach aims to enhance safety and reduce the consumption of valuable timber resources.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science and Naval Architecture"}
