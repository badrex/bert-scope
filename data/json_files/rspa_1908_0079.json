They find that the quantity of helium is determined by the traces of radioactive elements present in the minerals. The author also discusses the difficulties in finding suitable materials for comparison and the importance of considering geological age in understanding helium content. The study has implications for measuring geological time and understanding the rate of helium production from uranium.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geochronology"}
