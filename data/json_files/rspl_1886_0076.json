He discovered that didymium can be split into two new elements, praseodymium and neodymium, and identified a new element, dysprosium, based on its unique absorption spectrum. Additionally, he investigates the phosphorescent spectra of yttria and samaria, leading to the discovery of a new element associated with the orange line in their spectra.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
