They discovered four types of effects on spectral lines, including sharp triplets, quartets, doublets, and lines barely affected by the magnetic field. The study of these effects can provide insights into the character of molecular vibrations and the behavior of substances in magnetic fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
