He discovered that both substances must be in a liquid state and one of them must be a metallic conductor of electricity. The power of producing these movements is a general property of electrolytes and liquid metals. The direction of the movement is influenced by the chemical nature of the electrolyte and the presence of metallic impurities in the mercury.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
