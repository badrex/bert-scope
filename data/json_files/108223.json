They analyzed data from various locations, including Plymouth, Liverpool, and Bristol, and found that the empirical curve of rise and fall is generally unsymmetrical, with the fall being more rapid than the rise. The author also examined the variations in the length of the tidal half-day and the height of high and low water during a semilunation, concluding that these factors follow the theoretical laws. This knowledge can help improve navigation by predicting the height of the water at a given interval before or after the moment of high water.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
