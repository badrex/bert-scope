The authors find that differences in contact patterns among individuals and sites can significantly impact the basic reproductive rate of the infection. They apply their analysis to field data from a community in Zimbabwe, suggesting that targeted control efforts could be more effective by focusing on specific sites and individuals with higher transmission rates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Epidemiology"}
