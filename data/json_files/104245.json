He discovered that the motion of one clock's pendulum could affect the other, and the length of the pendulums played a significant role in the interaction. Ellicott found that the clocks could affect each other's timekeeping, but the effect was not consistent and depended on the length of the pendulums. This research provided insights into the mechanics of timekeeping and the behavior of pendulums.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
