He found that when the functions of the brain were suspended, no heat was generated, and the animal cooled more rapidly. This led him to conclude that the temperature of warm-blooded animals is significantly influenced by the nervous system, but the exact nature of this connection remains unclear.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Physiology"}
