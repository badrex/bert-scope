The authors found that the host can regulate the algal population based on external conditions like illumination and feeding regimes. They also discovered that the ability to control the growth rate of symbionts is related to the alga's capacity for maltose release. The research proposes a model for regulating algal cell division in the natural symbiosis, which explains the observed responses to changes in environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Symbiosis"}
