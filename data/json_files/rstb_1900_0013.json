They found that the primary visual area occupies the calcarine fissure and surrounding regions, and its size and distribution can be affected by conditions like optic atrophy and anophthalmos. The study provides insights into the cortical projection of the retina and the effects of various factors on the visual area.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Neuroanatomy"}
