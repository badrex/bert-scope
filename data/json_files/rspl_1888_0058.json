The authors used the Bunsen photometric method and three different instruments to measure the brightness of the corona, sky, and the total brightness excluding the sky effect. They found that the total light of the corona during the 1886 eclipse was almost half of that during the 1878 eclipse, due to differences in atmospheric conditions. The authors also suggest that seismometry methods could be useful in determining the extent of shaking experienced by engineering structures during storms or other disturbances.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
