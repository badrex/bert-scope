They develop a method to account for multiparticle interactions and determine the effective conductivity for various ratios of particle diameter to lattice size. The study provides estimates of the effective conductivity for a wide range of parameters, complementing percolation calculations.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
