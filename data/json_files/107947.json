The author, William Snow Harris, conducted experiments with various materials and found that the screening effect depends on the mass of the intervening substance. This discovery led him to believe that the screening influence of substances is more or less common to every class of substance, and that to render it sensible, it is only necessary to employ different bodies in masses bearing some direct ratio to their respective magnetic energies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Magnetism"}
