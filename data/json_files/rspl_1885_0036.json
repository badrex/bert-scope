They find that mechanical stress can significantly alter the specific electrical resistance of these metals, with iron and nickel showing the most noticeable changes. This research contributes to the understanding of the relationship between mechanical stress and electrical properties in metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
