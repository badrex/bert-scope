The researchers found that lithium vapour exhibits both channelled absorption spectra and fine line absorption spectra, similar to sodium. They also discovered that the channelled absorption spectrum of lithium is as complicated as that of sodium, and they speculate that the complexity may increase for metals with lower atomic weight in the alkali group.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Atomic and Molecular Spectroscopy"}
