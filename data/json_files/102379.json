He demonstrates the importance of accounting for this variation to avoid disputes between landowners. The author suggests that surveyors should use the true meridian for accurate mapmaking and that the variation should be considered when comparing old and new surveys.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
