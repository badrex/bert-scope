It explains the principles behind SAR, its advantages and limitations, and the importance of system coherence and scene coherence in obtaining accurate images. The article also highlights the potential of SAR in measuring physical parameters of the Earth's surface, such as surface roughness, dielectric constant, and scene motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Remote Sensing and Earth Observation"}
