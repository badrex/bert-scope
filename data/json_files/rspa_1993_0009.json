They use the Kirchhoff-Love theory to solve the equations governing the large deflections of elastic rods and find the shape of the M\u00f6bius band for various aspect ratios. The authors also present an asymptotic solution for large aspect ratios and calculate the elastic energy of the M\u00f6bius band."}
