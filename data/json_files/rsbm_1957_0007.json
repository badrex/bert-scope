He was also a skilled inventor, creating a tunable diaphragm for fog-alarm systems and a hot-wire anemometer. King's work was recognized with awards and medals, and he held a prestigious position at McGill University. Despite his achievements, his later years were affected by mental illness, which prevented him from continuing his scientific work."}
