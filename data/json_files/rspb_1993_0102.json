It found that infants have a high probability of becoming carriers, while the probability decreases sharply during early childhood and levels off to about 10% in young adults. The research provides a model to predict the expected probability of developing the carrier state given the age at infection, which can be useful for designing effective vaccination programs.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Infectious Diseases"}
