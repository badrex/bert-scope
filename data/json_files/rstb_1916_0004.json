The authors analyze oxygen consumption, exudation from blood vessels, and hemoglobin concentration in both muscle and glandular tissues during prolonged periods of exercise. The results provide insights into the metabolic changes and secondary effects in blood vessels and lymph flow, comparing the responses of muscle and glandular tissues to exercise.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
