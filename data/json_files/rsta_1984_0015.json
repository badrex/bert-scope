It concludes that most I-type granites have crustal sources with varying degrees of mantle-derived material, while S-type granites are derived from sedimentary rocks. The study provides insights into the relative contributions of mantle, oceanic crust, and continental crust to magma genesis.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Igneous Rocks"}
