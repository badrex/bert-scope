The author examines the properties and characteristics of suitable fiber and matrix combinations, such as density, strength, oxidation resistance, and compatibility. Experimental work on refractory metal and alumina filaments incorporated into nickel-base alloy matrices is described, and the merits and limitations of these composites compared to well-developed alloys strengthened by precipitation mechanisms are considered.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
