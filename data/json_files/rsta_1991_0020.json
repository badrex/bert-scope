It covers still-water bending, low-frequency bending due to waves, high-frequency bending caused by vibrations, and the overall control of combined effects. The authors propose criteria for each type of bending and explain how they are based on theoretical estimations and calibrated through service experience or full-scale measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering"}
