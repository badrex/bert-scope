They used advanced techniques to observe the profiles of spinning ionization fronts in detonation waves and found that these fluctuations were remarkably reproducible in a particular tube. The study provides insights into the possible origins of these fluctuations and their effects on the propagation of gaseous detonation.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Engineering"}
