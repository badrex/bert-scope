They discovered that mineral colours are more stable than vegetable colours and that the spectrum colours that cause fading are mainly at the blue end. The introduction of an active oxidizing agent, such as ozone, into the atmosphere can cause fading similar to prolonged exposure to light. The author concludes that the life of colours will be longer in an atmosphere free from an active oxidizing agent.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
