The authors argue that the streaming velocity is directly dependent on the coefficient of sound absorption, rather than the second coefficient of viscosity. They present a method for determining the sound-absorption coefficient of a liquid from measurements of the velocity of streaming and provide some typical results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid mechanics"}
