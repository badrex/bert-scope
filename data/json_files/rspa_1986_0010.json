The EPR spectra show hyperfine structure and can be fitted using spin Hamiltonian parameters. The results suggest that the spectra are attributed to nearest-neighbour pairs of ions with nearly degenerate ground states. The transition mechanism is driven by the component of the microwave magnetic field parallel to the principal axis of the matrix.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
