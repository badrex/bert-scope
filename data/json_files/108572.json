Sylvester, presents a theory on the syzygetic relations of two rational integral functions and applies it to Sturm's functions and the theory of greatest algebraical common measure. The study involves the concept of syzygetic functions, Bezoutian Primaries, and Bezoutic square, which are used to determine simplified residues and syzygetic multipliers.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra"}
