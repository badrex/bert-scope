They found that receptors activate normally as long as they are made up of at least three wild type subunits. The data suggest that there are five equivalent and independent GABA binding sites, with only three needing to bind GABA to open the pore.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
