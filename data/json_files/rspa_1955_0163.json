They found that certain gases, like sulfur hexafluoride and carbon tetrafluoride, increase the rate of decomposition. The results provide new insights into the current theory of unimolecular reactions and the role of foreign gases in the decomposition process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
