The authors found that the rate constants for the reactions were affected by the presence of different third bodies, such as argon and helium. The results provide insights into the behavior of oxygen and nitrogen atoms in various combination reactions and help compare their efficiency in different processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
