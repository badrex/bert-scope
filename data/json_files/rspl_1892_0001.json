They found a constant relation between the deviations of one organ and the mean deviation of another organ, which can be used to determine the degree of correlation between the organs. This study contributes to the understanding of shrimp biology and the application of statistical methods in biological research.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
