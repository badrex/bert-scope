The researchers found that the South African clawed toad's chromatic responses are mainly determined by photic stimuli, and they discovered a slight degree of primary reactivity of the chameleon type in Xenopus, suggesting that there is a dual nature of endocrine coordination in amphibian color change.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
