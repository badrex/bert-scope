They found that the iodide of lead has three coefficients of expansion, while the lead silver iodide alloy contracts when heated before expanding again at higher temperatures. The author also compared the alloy's properties to those of other iodide compounds.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography and Thermodynamics"}
