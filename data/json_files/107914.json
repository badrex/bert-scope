They discovered that the intensity of the electro-magnetic action in veins was related to the abundance of copper ore and depth. This finding could potentially help miners determine the quantity and direction of ore in veins. The author also investigated the conductivity of various minerals and found that the conducting power of metallic ores had no reference to the electrical properties of the metals in a pure state or the proportion of them in combination.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Geophysics"}
