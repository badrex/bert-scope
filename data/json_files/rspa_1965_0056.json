The author uses an asymptotic solution based on the hypotheses that the root is slender and that the growth rate is small compared with the radial-diffusion rate. The study provides an approximate solution to the integral equation and calculates the total uptake of the diffusing substance by the root.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Soil Science"}
