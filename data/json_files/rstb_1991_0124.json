The authors argue that the elements necessary for life have been synthesized in stars and ejected into space, eventually forming the atoms that make up the molecules in our bodies. This cosmic mixing of matter has contributed to the formation of life on Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Astrobiology"}
