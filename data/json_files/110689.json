They discovered that the germinal vesicle plays a crucial role in the development of cells and the formation of the new being. The author also found that the process of cell formation and growth is universal across various species and that the central portion of the altered germinal spot is the point of fecundation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
