The authors discuss the solubility determinations, the composition of solid phases in equilibrium with saturated solutions, and the temperature-concentration diagrams. The results provide insights into the behavior of these chemical components and their potential applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Equilibrium"}
