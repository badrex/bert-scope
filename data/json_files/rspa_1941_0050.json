They found that finite amplitude spherical waves, unlike plane waves, do not necessarily become shock waves and instead form a train of waves with diminishing amplitudes. This research provides a better understanding of air or 'blast' waves produced by explosions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
