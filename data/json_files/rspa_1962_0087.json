The author presents an approach to derive an asymptotic series solution for a class of channels with nearly straight walls, leading to unique solutions in a limited domain of physical parameters. The resulting velocity profiles include parabolic ones and profiles with a single region of flow reversal at each wall.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
