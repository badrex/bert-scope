The author explains how dislocations can move and interact with each other, leading to work-hardening and increased strength in alloys. The lecture also explores the relationship between dislocations and impurities in metals, which can lock and unlock dislocations, affecting their movement and the overall strength of the material.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
