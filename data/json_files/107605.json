They discovered that the urine of these species contains urea and has different physical and chemical properties compared to other amphibians. The study also highlights the importance of the structure of the kidneys in the secretion process and the relationship between diet and urine composition.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
