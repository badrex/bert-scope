They conclude that the errors mainly arise from an error in the epoch and an error in the place of the perigee. The author suggests correcting the solar tables by increasing the epochs of the sun by 9\" and the epochs of the perigee each by 1'48\".", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial Mechanics"}
