The authors discuss the role of nuclear genes PET111, PET494, and PET55 in the regulation of mitochondrial gene expression and how these genes may be involved in modulating the balance of mitochondrial and nuclear gene products in response to environmental conditions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
