They discovered that the intensity of certain groups of bands, known as the ft and y groups, is enhanced when oxygen compounds are present in the nitrogen. The author also investigated the effects of introducing various oxygen-containing gases into the afterglow, finding that this development is strong in all cases.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
