The research focuses on the differentiation of sex, the formation of the germinal ridge, and the urogenital union in both male and female mice. The findings provide important insights into the development of the gonads and their connections to the urogenital system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
