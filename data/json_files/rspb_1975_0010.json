They find that these proteins play a crucial role in controlling self-incompatibility, and that they are rapidly released onto the stigma surface during pollen-stigma interactions. The proteins are also found to have similarities with ragweed allergens, suggesting potential implications for hayfever in humans.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
