They discovered that the size of the dark space varies with the degree of exhaustion and found that the outer boundary of the dark space is where collisions between free electrons and positive ions occur. The author also observed that the size of the enclosing tube does not influence the size of the dark space, but the phosphorescence of the glass appears as the dark space disappears.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
