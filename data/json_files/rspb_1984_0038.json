The research reveals differences in the deployment of active zones in motor nerve-endings, which may be determined by the type of nerve that innervates them. The findings suggest that both the morphology and physiology of the end-plates are influenced by the nerves that connect them.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
