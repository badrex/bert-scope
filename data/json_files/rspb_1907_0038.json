They discovered two types of development, one resulting in a normal larva and the other in an abnormal one. The author also found that the condition of the egg at the moment of fertilization has a significant impact on the subsequent development and may be the origin of variations. The study has important implications for experimental studies using echinoderm eggs.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
