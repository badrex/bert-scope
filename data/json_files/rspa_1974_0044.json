They develop a formal method to find wavefunctions and complex energy eigenvalues of excited vibrational states in a linear triatomic system. The theory is applied to the HCl system, finding that vibrational predissociation broadening is negligible. The calculation of combination band intensities and energy spread will be reported in a subsequent paper.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Molecular Spectroscopy"}
