The authors extend previous studies to cubic autocatalysis and mixed systems where quadratic and cubic autocatalyses occur concurrently. They find that the reaction-diffusion wave has a form appropriate to a purely cubic autocatalysis when a non-dimensional parameter lies between certain values, and approaches those of quadratic autocatalysis when the parameter exceeds a specific value. The authors also examine the initial formation of a propagating reaction-diffusion front in the case of large initial concentration of the autocatalyst.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
