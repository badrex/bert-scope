The authors found that the activation energy for the fully inhibited reaction with pentane and heptane increases as the pressure decreases, while ethane and propane show little variation in activation energy with pressure. The results provide insights into the molecular reactions and mechanisms involved in the decomposition process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
