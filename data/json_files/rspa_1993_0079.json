They observe mechanical Williams domains, alternating bright and dark stripes, when the amplitude of oscillation exceeds a certain frequency-dependent threshold. A theoretical analysis is performed to predict the stripe thickness and critical amplitude as a function of frequency, showing good agreement with experimental results.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
