The author aligns amino acid sequences and uses a combination of automatic algorithms and structural elements to analyze the serpin family. The results suggest that there is as much diversity between plant and mammalian serpins as there is among mammalian serpins, and provide evidence for the constrained architecture of serpin molecules.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
