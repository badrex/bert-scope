The authors outline a method for analyzing transverse strength in waves, which can provide information typically sought in independent studies of'seakeeping.' The technique takes into account the warping of cross sections and the coupling of bending and twisting motions in the ship's hull, which are important factors in the strength and stability of these vessels.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Ship Design and Construction"}
