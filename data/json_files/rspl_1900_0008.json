The experiments show that the rate of diffusion of ions into a gas is inversely proportional to the pressure of the gas. The study also compares the diffusion rates of ions produced by different methods, such as radioactive substances, ultra-violet light, and point discharges.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
