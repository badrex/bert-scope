He found that when muriatic acid gas is electrified over mercury, hydrogen is evolved, and a part of the acid is converted into oxymuriatic acid gas. When mercury is not present, a different result occurs, and the gas does not change in bulk but is converted into oxymuriatic acid gas. Dr. Henry also discussed the commonly received theory and the one adopted by Mr. Davy to explain these phenomena, but he did not prefer one over the other.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
