They apply this method to a cyanobacterial metallothionein gene, smtA, from Synechococcus PCC 6301. The abundance of smtA transcripts was examined in cells exposed to heat shock and elevated concentrations of metal ions, showing an increase in abundance after exposure to these ions.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
