The authors describe the interaction between fig trees and their unique pollinators, the agaonids, and how they play a crucial role in the colonization of new islands. The study focuses on the zoological expeditions to the Krakatau Islands in 1984 and 1985, which provided an opportunity to observe the process of colonization as it took place. The authors compare the chalcid fauna of Anak Krakatau with those of other islands in the group and in tropical West Africa, finding remarkable similarities at the family level.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
