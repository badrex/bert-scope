{"article_id": "107632", "revised_title": "Comparative Study of Human and Elephant Membrana Tympani Structure and Hearing", "semantic_tags": ["Anatomy", "Hearing", "Comparative anatomy", "Animal behavior", "Musical sounds"], "tldr": "The author examines the structure of the membrana tympani in humans and elephants, discovering significant differences in form and function. The human ear's circular membrane and evenly distributed fibers allow for better adaptation to musical sounds, while the elephant's oval membrane and uneven fiber lengths make it less suitable for musical sounds. The author also observes that elephants can hear low-frequency sounds better than high-frequency sounds, suggesting a possible purpose for the unique structure of their membrana tympani.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
