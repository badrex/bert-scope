The study reveals multiple non-uniqueness, bifurcation, and catastrophe-type behavior when the problem is specified in terms of known heat transfer rates. The findings have implications for liquid lithium cells in fusion reactor blankets and potential experimental applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
