The research reveals that a ferment in the seed transforms fat into glycerine and ricinoleic acid, while another ferment breaks down proteins into peptone and asparagin. The embryo absorbs these materials through dialysis, refuting previous theories of oil penetration. The endosperm initiates the changes, but the embryo influences the process, leading to faster germination when in contact. A potent rennet ferment is also released during germination, with further experiments planned to understand its role.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
