They observed the angular distribution of the scattered protons and found that the results could be explained by an -component interacting with the Coulomb term in the formula for the scattered wave. This study provided insights into the behavior of particles in nuclear collisions and helped to advance the understanding of nuclear physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
