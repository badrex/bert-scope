They determined the average carbon-carbon bond distance in perylene and found the peri-bond length to be longer than the average carbon-carbon bond distance in the naphthalene molecule. This research helped in understanding the molecular structure of perylene and provided insights into the peri-bonds' properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
