The researchers found that the addition of gases like argon, nitrogen, and carbon dioxide affects the rate of decomposition. They proposed a theory that suggests the existence of potentially rate-determining processes other than energization of molecules in collisions and chemical decomposition. This theory links to certain spectroscopic considerations previously advanced by Herzberg and offers a better explanation of the complex group of phenomena observed in the study."}
