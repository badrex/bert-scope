It examines the behavior of dislocations and the factors affecting grain boundary structure, such as friction, non-coincidence boundaries, and the action of different elements. The study provides insights into the conditions that lead to ordered and disordered segregation, which can affect material properties and fracture behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Grain Boundaries"}
