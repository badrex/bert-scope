They discuss the effects of scattering and the solar spectrum, and explore different types of darkening predicted by theory for stars of varying temperatures and atmospheric compositions. The study also investigates the deductions that can be made about a star if its law of darkening is given.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
