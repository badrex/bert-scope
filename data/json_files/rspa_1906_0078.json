They observed that opalescence appears when the volume of the substance is below a certain limit and becomes denser as the volume decreases. The position of maximum opalescence depends on the mean specific volume of the substance. The author's observations confirm and supplement previous findings by Travers and Usher.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
