The authors derive a generalized formula for the energy radiated by a charged particle moving through a medium with a velocity greater than the phase velocity of electromagnetic waves. They also discuss the increase in intensity of Cerenkov radiation due to the permeability of the medium and suggest experiments to detect this effect in highly permeable mediums.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
