The authors develop a theory to calculate electron density at the source and analyze recent observations to derive new values for forbidden transition probabilities. The findings suggest high electron densities in solar active regions, which could be due to the presence of magnetic fields and unresolved condensations within the emitting regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
