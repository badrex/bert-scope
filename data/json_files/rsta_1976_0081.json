The author examines the thermodynamics of crystal-solution systems and the different types of geological processes involved, such as pressure-solution, cavity growth, pressure growth, and solution-transfer. The study aims to provide a better understanding of the strains and displacements associated with these processes in rocks.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
