They found that for geometrically similar pipes, the resistance of fluids is constant, and confirmed the existence of similar motions in fluids under certain conditions. These findings have practical applications in predicting the resistance of aircraft and understanding fluid dynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
