The results show that at least five evolutionary events, either four origins and one loss or five origins, are required to explain the distribution of soldiers in the family. The positions of the origins and losses are well-resolved, providing a historical framework for further research on the causes of soldier aphid evolution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
