The results showed that the implanted human carcinoma retained its vitality and exhibited cell division for the first five days after implantation. However, after this period, no evidence of vitality was observed, and mitosis was inhibited. The study concluded that human carcinoma is less viable in animals other than monkeys.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
