This paper outlines the main achievements of the 17 projects conducted during the MAP period and compares the understanding of the middle atmosphere in 1986 to that in 1976. Key findings include the importance of the polar vortex as a material entity, the role of small-scale motions in the stratospheric circulation, and the potential impact of these motions on stratospheric chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
