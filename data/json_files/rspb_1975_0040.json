They found that synaptic activity led to an influx of calcium ions, which could be detected by the light emitted by aequorin. This allowed them to estimate the amount of calcium entering the postsynaptic axon and study its relationship with membrane polarization and the effect of various agents on the synaptic light.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
