The researchers reconstructed the ventral nerve cord using serial section electron micrographs and identified various types of specialized contact sites between neurons, such as chemical synapses and gap junctions. They also described the arrangement of motor neurons and interneurons, which play a crucial role in sensory integration and muscle innervation. This work contributes to our understanding of the development and function of simple nervous systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
