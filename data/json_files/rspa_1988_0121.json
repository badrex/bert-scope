They develop an explicit matrix Wiener-Hopf factorization to solve the problem and derive an asymptotic expression for the field scattered to infinity. This work contributes to understanding sound scattering and has applications in acoustics and engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
