They find that the excretory organs of Amphioxus are essentially identical to the nephridia in function, segmental arrangement, and detailed histological structure. This study helps to better understand the evolutionary relationships between these organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Comparative Anatomy"}
