The authors found that increasing temperature affects ciliary movement and cell stability, with a gradual reduction in the amplitude of the ciliary beat and a decrease in oxygen consumption. The results suggest that high temperatures may cause a loss of enzyme stability rather than a lack of oxygen.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
