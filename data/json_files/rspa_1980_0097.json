The theory accounts for the strain rates in the zones of intense plastic deformation and the chip interface, using flow stress data from high-speed compression tests. The results show good agreement between predicted and experimental cutting forces, tool/chip interface plastic zone thickness, and temperatures and strain rates in the plastic zone.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Manufacturing and Machining"}
