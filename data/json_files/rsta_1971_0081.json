The author highlights the need for a fresh approach to solving the thermocline problem, considering different regimes and boundary conditions. The article also presents a formulation of the problem and explores the ideal fluid regime and its implications for understanding ocean currents.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
