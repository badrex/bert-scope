They consider two cases: one where the wire turns lie in circles perpendicular to the axis and another where they form a closely wound helix. The corrections to the approximate value of the galvanometer constant are found by assuming the current to be uniformly distributed in circles through the section of the channel.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
