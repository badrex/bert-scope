The author examines the thyroid's connections to the trachea and larynx during fetal development and concludes that it is developed in connection with the air-tube and has no relation to the thymus gland. The thyroid does not consist of two separate lateral masses, and the isthmus is present from the first as a distinct central portion. The pyramid is an outlying part of the body, presenting various shapes and sites during fetal life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human anatomy"}
