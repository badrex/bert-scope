They found that each antiserum was effective in neutralizing the effects of the specific gonadotropic extract it was prepared against. The study also showed that there is a high degree of species and source specificity in antigonadotropic sera, meaning that they are more effective against hormones from the same species and source they were derived from.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Endocrinology"}
