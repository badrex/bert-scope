The authors investigate the proportion of cells that can grow in a new medium and the fate of those that do not. They discuss the two main hypotheses for these adaptive changes: mutation and the modification of internal structures within the cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
