It reviews the theoretical background of infrared emission and absorption processes, describes laboratory studies of possible lunar surface materials, and presents data obtained from the Moon itself. The authors explain how the mid-infrared region of the spectrum can provide valuable information about the molecular composition of the lunar surface, which is essential for understanding and exploring the Moon.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Planetary Science"}
