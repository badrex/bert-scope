The authors analyze the distribution of impact craters, the age of the Earth's surface, and the relationship between cratering rate and geological time. They also discuss the energy of causative projectiles and the mass distribution index of incident objects.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Planetary Science"}
