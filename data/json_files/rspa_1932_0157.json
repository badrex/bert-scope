The authors, R. C. Johnson, N. R. Tawde, and E. V. Appleton, analyze the spectral lines and provide a mathematical explanation for the observed intensity variations. Their work contributes to the understanding of molecular spectra and the application of quantum mechanics in chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
