The authors present a new model for power-compensated differential scanning calorimetry, which considers the dynamic process of heating a reactive sample continuously. This model provides a clear and compact description of the reaction's behavior for all useful operating conditions, improving the accuracy of determining kinetic parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
