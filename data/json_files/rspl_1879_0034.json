The author, C. Handfield Jones, discusses the varying effects of these agents on the heart's force and pulse rate. The study also explores the uncertainty of results from both agents and the possible causes of curves in the tracing, such as deranged cardiac or arterial action. The author concludes that the occurrence of curves in the tracing is a morbid sign and that narcosis and fatigue can weaken the heart's force and arterial contractility.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Anaesthesia and Cardiology"}
