It examines the structure and function of the endodermis, a crucial barrier that helps regulate the composition of the transpiration stream. The article also explores the limitations of current understanding and the need for further research to improve our knowledge of root function and solute transport.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
