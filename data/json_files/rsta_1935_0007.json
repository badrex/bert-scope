The author presents a new approach to solving elastic problems involving finite strain, focusing on the components of strain, boundary conditions, and stress-strain relations for isotropic materials. The author also provides examples of applications and compares the results with experimental findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
