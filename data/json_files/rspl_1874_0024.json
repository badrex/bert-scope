They observe a decrease in toughness and an increase in weight, which is more pronounced in steel. The author also notes the absence of frothing in steel, which they attribute to its different molecular structure and the occlusion of more gas. The study aims to understand the cause of these changes and their potential implications.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Corrosion and Materials Failure"}
