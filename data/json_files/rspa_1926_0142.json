The temperature effect on the bands shows that each band originates from the rotation of the hydrogen molecule, and the origin of different bands is the vibration of the molecule. The study also suggests that the motion of particles in the molecule is more complex than in simple rotation-vibration bands.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Molecular Physics"}
