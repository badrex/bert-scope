They found improvements in the measurement of wave-lengths for sodium and potassium, and observed an interesting combination pair indicating satellites to the diffuse series. This research contributes to the understanding of the spectra of alkali metals and their applications in spectroscopy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
