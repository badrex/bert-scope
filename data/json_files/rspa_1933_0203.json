They found that the reaction is bimolecular and the orientation of the polar groups in the lactone film plays a significant role in determining the reaction velocity. The results can be applied to the study of other heterogeneous catalytic reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
