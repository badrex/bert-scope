They found that adrenalectomy and renin-angiotensin infusion cause a redistribution of blood flow and increase capillary permeability. The study also demonstrated a correlation between the effects of adrenalectomy and renin-angiotensin on capillary permeability and the haemodynamic changes they cause. The authors suggest that these findings could have implications for understanding proteinuria and other pathological sequels of renin-angiotensin infusion and adrenalectomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
