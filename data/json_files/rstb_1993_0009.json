The primary attachment organs are the suckers derived from the maxillules, which have two major muscle groups for suction and orientation. The mouth tube, preoral spine, and other feeding structures are also described, providing insights into the parasite's attachment and feeding mechanisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology > Parasitology"}
