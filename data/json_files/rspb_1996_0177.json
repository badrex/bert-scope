They found that these lines also showed resistance to Brugia pahangi filarial worms. The study highlights the potential for using phenotypic selection to develop mosquitoes with increased resistance to diseases, which could help control the spread of diseases like malaria and dengue fever.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics"}
