They found that some peptides form a non-cooperative monomer-dimer-trimer equilibrium, and investigated the factors that cause the peptides to form trimers instead of dimers. This work led to the development of a corrected helix thermodynamic scale and provided insights into protein folding and structure.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure and Function"}
