These bodies are found in resting bacterial spores and vegetative cells from young cultures. The author concludes that these dumbbell-shaped bodies are comparable to the chromosomes of plant and animal cells, and they grow and divide with the organism, preceding the division of the cell.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cytology"}
