They discovered that chain branching is favored by an increase in the pressure of the combustible substance but is retarded by oxygen. The observed behavior is explained by a reaction scheme involving degenerate branching by intermediate peroxides. The results provide insights into the structural effects on the rate of oxidation and the role of the carbonyl group in enhancing the reaction rate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
