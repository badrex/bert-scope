They analyze the interference effects that arise when orbits around different centers are coupled and how energy levels are broadened and reform into a different set of levels. The study also reveals the evolution of the level system and the impact of magnetic breakthrough on metallic behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
