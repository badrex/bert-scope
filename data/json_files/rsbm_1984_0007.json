He developed a method for the quantitative separation of helium and neon, and his work on the Szilard-Chalmers reaction led to the development of \"hot-atom\" chemistry. Glueckauf also conducted research on the water vapor content in the stratosphere, which was later confirmed by other scientists.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface chemistry"}
