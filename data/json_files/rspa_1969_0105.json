It explores the advantages and limitations of this method of sample preparation and compares it with other possible techniques. The electromagnetic method of stable isotope separation is well established, and isotope separators have been used for nuclear spectroscopy, ion-solid interaction studies, and ion doping of semiconductors. The article highlights the importance of optimizing every stage of the implantation procedure to achieve precise alignment, collimation, and control over ion beam energy, dose, and dose measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Ion implantation and Ion-solid interactions"}
