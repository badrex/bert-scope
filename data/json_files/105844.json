He used various astronomical instruments to make precise measurements of the event, which helped determine the Sun's parallax and contributed to the understanding of Venus's diameter and the least distance between its center and the Sun. Winthrop's observations were crucial for the scientific community to study the solar system and improve timekeeping.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Planetary Transits"}
