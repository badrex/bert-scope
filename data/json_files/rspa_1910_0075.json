They explore the relationship between pressure and density in progressive waves and discuss the conditions that lead to the formation of rarefaction and condensation waves. The study also considers the effects of different laws, such as Boyle's law and the adiabatic law, on wave propagation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
