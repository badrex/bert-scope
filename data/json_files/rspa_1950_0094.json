They find that the specific heat anomaly is of the same type in all lattices, with an infinity in the specific heat at the Curie temperature. The study also shows that second-nearest neighbor interactions can significantly affect the position of the Curie temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
