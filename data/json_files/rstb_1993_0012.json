SRY acts during a critical period of gonadal differentiation to divert the normal pathway of gene activity towards testes development. The author explains how SRY expression is crucial for testis determination and how it interacts with other genes to regulate cellular phenotype. The article also highlights the importance of cell-cell interactions in the developing gonad for successful testis differentiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Developmental Biology"}
