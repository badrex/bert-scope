The research discusses the challenges of comparing laboratory experiments to real-world situations and the ecological consequences of sublethal effects of hydrocarbons on marine life. The findings suggest that oil pollution can lead to reduced feeding rates, increased energy expenditure, and impaired reproductive success, ultimately affecting the health and survival of marine populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology"}
