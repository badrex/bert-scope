The authors derive uniformly valid approximations to solutions of the governing differential equations and analyze the stability of the mean corner flow velocity profile. The study provides insights into the behavior of the secondary flow and the critical layer in the blending boundary layer region.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
