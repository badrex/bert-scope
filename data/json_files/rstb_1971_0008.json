They found that Aldabra has one of the largest tidal ranges among oceanic islands, with a mean spring-tide range of 2.74 meters. The study involved setting up ten tide-recording stations and analyzing the tidal patterns, currents, and sediment transport patterns in the atoll's channels. The authors also discussed the influence of the Mozambique Channel on Aldabra's tidal characteristics and the impact of tidal ranges on marine communities and insolation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
