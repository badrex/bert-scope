The research finds that albumin accelerates the nucleation of crystals at a pH of more than 7.5, and that protein denaturation and blocking exposed carboxylate groups on the protein significantly reduce the nucleating effect. The study also reveals that albumin interacts preferentially with specific crystal faces, providing insights into the mechanism of gout.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
