They find that stability in the replicative form of RNA molecules correlates with their self-interaction free energy and that replication rates are related to the thermodynamic stability of the replicative form. This study provides a sequence-dependent indicator of RNA fitness, which can be used to estimate the fitness of self-replicating RNA species based on their genome makeup.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > RNA Biology"}
