The authors explore the translational and rotational freedom of these substances on the surface and derive theoretical heat of adsorption values. The findings provide insights into the nature of adsorbed films and the freedom experienced by molecules on mercury surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Science"}
