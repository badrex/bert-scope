The researchers measured differential cross-sections for these scattering processes at various energies and four-momentum transfer ranges. The study also analyzed the slope parameters and the ratio of the real to the imaginary scattering amplitude, providing insights into the energy dependence of these parameters.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
