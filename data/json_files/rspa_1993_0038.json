This theory generalizes Long's model and can be used to investigate the long-time evolution of the response up to the time wave breaking first occurs. The theory is particularly useful for understanding the behavior of the fluid near the hydrostatic limit, where the spectrum of long-wave modes is continuous, and resonance occurs at all flow speeds.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
