The author explains the role of specific amino acids and chemical groups in the catalytic activity and substrate binding of these enzymes. The acyl-enzyme mechanism is explored through various experimental techniques, including the use of chromophoric substrates and inhibitors. The article highlights the importance of understanding enzyme reactions for the study of hydrolytic enzymes and their applications in various biological processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
