Using a Fourier analysis, the author tests for the presence of this quantum in circle-diameters from various sites. While the sample size is small, the study raises questions about the use of a standard unit of length in ancient construction and the possibility of a quantum effect in the measurements.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Archaeology"}
