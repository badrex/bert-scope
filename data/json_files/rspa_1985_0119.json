The method involves using Jaffe's characteristic equation and Teukolsky's equations describing small perturbations to the Kerr geometry. The study reveals an infinite number of complex quasi-normal frequencies for each -pole moment in a Schwarzschild black hole, with the real parts of the corresponding frequencies being bounded, while the imaginary parts are not.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astrophysics"}
