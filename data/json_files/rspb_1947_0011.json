It found that adrenalectomy intensified the action of procaine on body temperature, and steroids like desoxycorticosterone acetate and sex hormones inhibited this effect. The results suggest that the adrenal cortex plays a role in protecting against the alkaloid.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
