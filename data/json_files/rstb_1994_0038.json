The study finds that the distribution and intensity of spongiform degeneration, prion protein amyloid plaque formation, and the distribution of abnormal prion protein are essential parameters that define prion diseases. The findings suggest that prion isolates target specific neuron populations for the synthesis of abnormal prion protein, and that prion isolate diversity is determined by neurons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular Biology"}
