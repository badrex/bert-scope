The research examines the effects of the host plant (tomato), temperature, pH, suction potential, osmotic potential, and soil pore size on the infectivity of the nematode. The findings suggest that the optimum conditions for maximum infection involve a combination of factors, including temperature, soil moisture, and pore size, which create an environment conducive to rapid migration and invasion of the host plant root. The study also highlights the limited infective time of the nematode larvae and the factors that influence penetration, such as multiple invasion, attraction to roots, and interference between individuals.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Nematology"}
