They use a four-dimensional function to smoothen the charge distribution, resulting in finite electromagnetic field quantities and equations of motion. This approach resolves the issues faced in the traditional point electron theory and provides a more consistent framework for classical electrodynamics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
