They discovered a unique respiratory system involving a series of valves, air chambers, and a felt chamber that acts as a \"perforated piston.\" This system allows the tsetse larva to breathe and move air through its tracheal system efficiently. The author also found that the respiratory muscles play a crucial role in this process.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Insect Anatomy"}
