They find that the susceptibility of a ferromagnet diverges near the critical temperature with a law, and discuss the susceptibility of an antiferromagnet. The specific heat near the critical point is considered, but the results are inconclusive.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Statistical Mechanics"}
