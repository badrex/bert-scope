The authors explore the structural setting, regent subsidence, and sea-level fluctuations, providing a comprehensive understanding of the complex phenomena affecting the region. They also reconstruct the early Holocene shorelines using seismic profiling and borehole data, offering insights into the area's submerged land surface and its implications for the present-day landscape.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Coastal Geology"}
