The author uses mathematical expressions to calculate the force exerted by the current on a unit of magnetism placed near the coil. The findings contribute to the understanding of galvanomagnetic attraction and its applications in electromagnetism.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
