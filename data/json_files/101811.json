The clock's mechanism consists of a weight that restores balance and a drum with a spring that helps raise the weight. This invention allows the clock to stand in equilibrium and ascend upward. The author does not give detailed instructions on how to make the clock's wheels, as it requires knowledge of applying spring force to a clock's motion.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
