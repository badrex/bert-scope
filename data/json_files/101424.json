He describes how the tides run East for 12 hours and West for another 12 hours during certain months, and how this behavior is different from the regular tidal patterns. Moray also mentions the difficulty in understanding the causes of these strange tidal reciprocations due to the lack of accurate maps and his limited opportunity to survey the area.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
