They found that choline could be detected in the blood of these patients using chemical and physiological tests. The authors also studied the ionization of cats' sciatic nerves and the behavior of positively and negatively charged ions in atmospheric electricity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurochemistry"}
