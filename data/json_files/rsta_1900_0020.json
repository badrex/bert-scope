The author discusses the conductivity of dilute solutions and the ionization of potassium permanganate, bichromate, and ferricyanide in dilute solutions. The study aims to determine the coefficient of ionization and its connection to freezing point phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Solution Theory"}
