They found that the deposits were primarily chalk muds and fine rubbles produced by frost-shattering and melting snow-fields. The climate during the Late-glacial Period experienced improvements, as evidenced by a rendsina soil separating two sheets of chalk muds. The age of the soil was confirmed by radiocarbon dating and correlated with the Usselo Layer within the Younger Coversands of the Netherlands. The deposits contained a unique fauna of land Mollusca, which provided insights into the ecological and climatic changes during the Late-glacial Period.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geology"}
