The author derives an equation for heat conduction and discusses the conditions for equilibrium, including the role of the lapse rate and eddy friction. The study also considers the effects of general atmospheric motion and boundary conditions, such as rigid and free surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
