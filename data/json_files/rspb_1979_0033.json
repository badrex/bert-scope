Four types of cells are described in the ganglion cell layer, which are considered analogous to the a, b, and y cells found in the cat retina. The research also provides evidence of a cell type in the ganglion cell layer that does not send an axon into the optic nerve. The findings contribute to the understanding of the rat retina's structure and function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
