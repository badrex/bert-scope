The researchers found that the magnetic properties of these metals are influenced by the orientation and crystal axes. The magnetic susceptibility of these metals is independent of temperature, making them interesting for further study in the field of magnetism and atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
