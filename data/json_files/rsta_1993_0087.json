They consider energy balance between radiation, conduction, and free or forced convection in humid air, incorporating surface temperature, humidity, and wind into a mathematical model. The model predicts a lifted minimum for certain values of ground emissivity, surface cooling rates, and eddy transport, and demonstrates agreement with observations. The key role of surface emissivity and soil thermal conductivity is highlighted, showing that a lifted minimum can occur without the presence of particulate constituents like haze.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Sciences"}
