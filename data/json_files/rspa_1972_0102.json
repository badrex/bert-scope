They used anisotropic linear elastodynamic theory to provide boundary conditions and analyzed the interatomic interactions. The results indicate that continuum theory can accurately predict crack-tip displacement fields, except within about three atomic spacings from the tip. The study discusses existing continuum models of crack-tip structure and suggests that a narrow slit terminated by a single line of bonds close to the rupture point better represents the geometry of the crack tip.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Crystallography"}
