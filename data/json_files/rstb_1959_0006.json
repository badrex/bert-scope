They analyze the various environments, including alluvial, fluviatile, lacustrine, deltaic, and estuarine, and suggest that these changes were controlled by movements of the sea on the Wealden margin. The study provides insights into the causes of these cyclothems, including changes in lake levels, river diversions, and sea movements across the Paris Basin.", "scientific_discipline": "Geology > Sedimentology"}
