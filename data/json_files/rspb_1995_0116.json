Results show that small mustelid predators, such as weasels and stoats, were the main cause of mortality in the decline phase of the vole population cycle. In contrast, their importance was less significant in the increase phase. The findings suggest that predators may be responsible for causing a decline in the density of these prey populations.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
