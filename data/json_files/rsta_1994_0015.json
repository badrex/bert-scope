It explores the He'non map, attractors, metric descriptions, and the one-dimensional case of the quadratic family of maps. The authors aim to understand the statistical properties and invariant measures of these systems, which are essential for describing their behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Dynamical Systems"}
