The model suggests that the myosin rod portion connecting the heads to the thick filament shaft gradually bends, allowing the subfragment 2 to detach and reattach during the crossbridge cycle. This movement provides the restoring force and accounts for the elastic element observed in mechanical transient experiments on vertebrate skeletal muscle.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biomechanics"}
