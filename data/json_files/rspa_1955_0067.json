They discovered that growth arises from sheet nuclei consisting of small condensed monomolecular films and that screw dislocations play a significant role in crystal growth. The findings also revealed that crystals often have a twist boundary parallel to {001}, which is penetrated by a screw dislocation or a group of screw dislocations.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Crystallography"}
