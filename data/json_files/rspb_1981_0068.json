They discovered that caffeine induces calcium discharge from the sarcoplasmic reticulum in atrial, but not ventricular, frog heart cells. Evidence also suggests that caffeine enhances calcium influx through the cell surface. These findings provide insights into the role of the sarcoplasmic reticulum in cardiac muscle cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cardiology"}
