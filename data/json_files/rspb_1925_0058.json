They found that sensitised vaccines have an immediate but brief immunising effect, while raw vaccines confer a more prolonged immunity. The study also showed that sensitised vaccines have reduced antigenic power compared to raw vaccines, and that a small fraction of antibodies in a sensitised pneumococcal vaccine remains firmly combined.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
