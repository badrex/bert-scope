They made pilot balloon flights to study wind conditions at great heights and found a remarkably small wind velocity above 15 km. The meteorograph showed a stable troposphere, a marked temperature inversion at the tropopause, and an unusual increase of temperature with increasing height in the stratosphere. These findings contribute to the understanding of atmospheric conditions in polar regions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Meteorology"}
