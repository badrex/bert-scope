The author examines the relationship between shear and volume extension in solids and how these factors influence the limits of the material's properties. The study focuses on the development of cracks in isotropic materials and how the further spread of the crack depends on the action in the vicinity of its end.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Solid Mechanics"}
