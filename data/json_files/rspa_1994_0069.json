The authors present a new Lagrangian finite difference scheme to solve the governing equations and demonstrate a surprisingly good agreement between experimental results and theoretical predictions. This research contributes to a better understanding of the motion of cohesionless granular materials in real-world situations.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
