Radiography has advantages in detecting volume-type defects, providing permanent records, and measuring internal dimensions. However, it struggles with detecting fine planar defects like cracks. Ultrasonic testing offers a potential alternative but is not yet a perfect replacement for radiography. The future of non-destructive testing will likely involve a combination of both techniques.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Non-Destructive Testing"}
