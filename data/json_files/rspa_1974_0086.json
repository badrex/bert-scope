They found that the isotope shifts show departures from a linear relation between neutron number and isotope shift, similar to those found in barium and cesium. The study confirms the hypothesis that the ratio of field-shifts of isotopes should be constant in all lines and provides a better understanding of the anomalies in isotope shifts.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Nuclear Physics"}
