They found that different bacteria produce these compounds under different conditions, and that acetylmethylcarbinol is the main product in most cases. The authors also discovered that the previous theory suggesting that sugars undergoing bacterial fermentation break down to trioses, such as glyceraldehyde, is not supported by their findings.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
