They find that the massif is composed of three main units: the Sheeted Intrusive Complex, the Troodos Plutonic Complex, and the Troodos Pillow Lava Series. The large gravity anomaly over the massif is correlated with the high-density rocks, suggesting that the massif evolved as an oceanic volcanic pile between continental masses before being uplifted during the Alpine orogeny.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology and Tectonics"}
