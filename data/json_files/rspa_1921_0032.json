They used a control curve to determine the course of heat production in a substance. The method involves subtracting the control curve from the observed curve to obtain the heat production at specific intervals. This technique can be applied to various cases where a sudden outburst of heat can be provided at a definite moment.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
