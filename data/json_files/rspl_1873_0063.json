The author concludes that the remains are actually from a Pika, or tailless Hare, and not a Lemming. The spectroscopy experiments reveal the absorption and emission spectrum of sodium vapor, providing insights into the properties of the element.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
