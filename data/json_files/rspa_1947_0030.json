They demonstrate that the frictional force decreases as the velocity decreases at very low speeds and increases at low speeds, leading to relaxation oscillations or'stick-slips'. The study also shows that the presence or absence of'stick-slips' at a particular temperature depends on the speed of sliding, the dynamics of the measuring instrument, and the nature of the kinetic friction-velocity relationship.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
