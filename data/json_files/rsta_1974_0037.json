The author emphasizes the importance of developing synthetic fuels in North America to reduce pressure on world oil supplies and meet the energy needs of Western nations. The article also highlights the potential of tar sands, oil shale, and coal as resources for synthetic fuel production and the challenges and technologies involved in their extraction and processing.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Energy and Fuels"}
