They found that these proteins have a fixed and variable portion in their sequence. The study also revealed that the amino acid interchanges in the light chains are clustered around specific regions, which may define a portion of the antigen-combining site in the light chains of antibodies. The authors also discovered a strong correlation between the amino acid at position 189 and the Inv genetic factor in the light chains.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
