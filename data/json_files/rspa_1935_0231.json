They obtained data for isotherms at various temperatures and pressures, which can be used to study gas properties and thermodynamics. The results provide insights into the behavior of CO2 under extreme conditions and contribute to the understanding of its physical properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Thermodynamics"}
