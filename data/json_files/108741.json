He discovered that when a nerve is traversed by an electric current, it acquires a secondary electromotor power, which can produce an electric current in a contrary direction to the exciting current. This property is connected to the nerve's structure and ceases when its integrity is impaired. The author also developed a method for comparing the electromotor power of different animal parts, which can be useful in further electro-physiological research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
