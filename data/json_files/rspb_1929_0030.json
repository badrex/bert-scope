The research shows that there is a threshold of intensity and duration of exposure, below which no significant impact on cell division is observed. The findings also reveal that after certain exposure durations, cell division returns to normal levels, while longer exposures result in permanent damage to cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
