Shade-adapted corals have more chlorophyll per zooxanthella cell but not a significantly different number of cells per unit area. The study finds that rate of photosynthesis at saturating light intensities is the same per unit area in both forms, but it is significantly different when measured by amount of chlorophyll. The study also shows that light-adapted Stylophora pistillata can acquire all of their basal metabolic carbon through photosynthesis and translocation, while shade-adapted colonies growing in shade acquire slightly less than half.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Environmental and Earth Sciences"}
