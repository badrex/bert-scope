It describes the transformation of the lamprey's skeleton during metamorphosis and compares it to other related fish types. The author highlights the differences in mouth structures and the development of the branchial skeleton in lampreys, emphasizing their importance in understanding the evolution of vertebrates.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vertebrate Anatomy"}
