The study reveals novel features about the order-disorder transformation taking place around the A point, with definite hysteresis and a large positive excess thermo-electric potential. The findings are interpreted in terms of a general theory of phase transformations involving intermediate hybrid structures with domains of the two forms coexistent in the A region of temperatures.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
