It discusses the conditions necessary for a sail to adopt a symmetrical profile with constant curvature and examines the lift distribution, equilibrium, and stability of a sail under tension. The theory is applicable to flexible two-dimensional sails and ideal fluids with free stream pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
