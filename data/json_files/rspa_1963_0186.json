They also found that atomic oxygen and hydroxyl radicals are produced in the process, and determined the rate constant for the reaction. This research provides valuable insights into the kinetics of the hydrogen-oxygen reaction and its related processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
