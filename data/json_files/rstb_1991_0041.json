The author discusses the role of active site residues, such as histidine and lysine, in controlling the chemistry of the coenzyme. Stereochemical and kinetic techniques are used to analyze the reactions, providing insights into the catalytic processes of these enzymes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
