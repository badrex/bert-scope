They successfully expanded knowledge of the spectra for these elements, including antimony, bismuth, calcium, magnesium, copper, and silver, as well as the spark spectra of aluminum, antimony, bismuth, cadmium, calcium, lead, magnesium, thallium, and tin. The study used fluorite spectrograph and vacuum grating spectrograph for their research.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
