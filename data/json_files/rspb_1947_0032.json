The author investigates the solubility, molecular weight, and other characteristics of both soluble and dispersed fibroin. They also explore the denaturation process and the formation of insoluble products. The author suggests that the water-soluble form of fibroin is the native or renatured protein, while the original protein is the denatured form. Some aspects of protein and polypeptide chains as macromolecules are also discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protein Structure and Function"}
