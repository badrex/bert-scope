They discovered that the periodic bands seen in electron micrographs change in length when the fibers are wet, while the regions between them remain mostly unaffected. The results suggest that the bands are highly disordered regions in dry fibers that become more ordered upon hydration. The authors also attempted to determine the structure of collagen fibers using the intensity data from the low-angle patterns, but further research is needed.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
