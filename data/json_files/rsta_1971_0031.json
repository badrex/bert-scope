The authors extend existing tables of meniscus profiles by Bashforth and Adams, generating profiles beyond their original range and into new regions of shape factors. They also create tables for menisci that do not cross the axis of symmetry, such as those formed by a rod at a free liquid surface. The study discusses the properties of shape factors and the volume of meniscus parts bounded by horizontal planes, relating it to the forces acting between the planes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Mechanics"}
