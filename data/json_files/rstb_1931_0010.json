The embryo is well-preserved and provides valuable insights into the development of early human embryos. The study focuses on the embryonal shield, yolk-sac vesicle, connecting stalk, and the yolk-sac process. The findings contribute to the understanding of human embryonic development and the role of the yolk-sac process in particular.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Embryology"}
