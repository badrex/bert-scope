They found that removing detritus from the emulsion increased phagocytosis, while adding detritus reduced it. The presence of detritus in the emulsion influenced the opsonic index, with higher amounts of detritus leading to clearer differentiation between normal and subnormal blood samples.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Immunology"}
