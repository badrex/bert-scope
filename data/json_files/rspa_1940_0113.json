The authors found that compounds containing phosphorus or other elements of group V form a metal phosphide on the surface, which aids in maintaining a polish and reducing wear. The addition of long-chain polar compounds with these agents further enhances wear prevention.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
