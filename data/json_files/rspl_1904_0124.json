The authors found that the conductivities of ice, naphthaline, aniline, and nitrophenol increase at low temperatures, while glycerine has a maximum conductivity around room temperature. The results provide insights into the behavior of materials under different conditions and their potential applications in heat transfer and insulation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
