The authors found that increasing pressure causes significant changes in the character and intensity of the spectral lines. The study also reveals that some lines are eliminated, while others are enhanced or reversed under pressure, suggesting an approach to the arc condition in the spark under pressure.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Spectroscopy"}
