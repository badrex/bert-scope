The researchers found that these currents are dependent on membrane potential and can be explained by a simple diffusion model. This discovery helps to understand the complex processes of synaptic transmission and the role of ion channels in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurophysiology"}
