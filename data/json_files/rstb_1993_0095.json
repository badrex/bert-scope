It examines their adaptations for accessing xylem tissue and the interactions between parasitic plants and their hosts, as well as the influence of host-sourced signals on the parasite. The article also explores the feeding mechanisms of xylem-feeding insects and their impact on plant productivity.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
