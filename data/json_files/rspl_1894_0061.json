They discovered that some compounds, like pilocarpine, stimulate liver cells and increase secretory activity, while others, like aniline, may have a destructive effect on certain cells and cause the splitting of iron-containing organic compounds. The study provides valuable insights into the physiological actions of drugs and their chemical structures on liver cells.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Hepatology"}
