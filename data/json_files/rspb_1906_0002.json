They found that variations in hydrogen and hydroxyl ion concentrations led to profound alterations in cell growth and division. The experiments also showed that increased alkalinity could induce pathological mitoses, similar to those seen in cancer cells. The study provides insights into the relationship between changes in ion concentrations and the development of malignant diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
