This suggests an ancient link between these groups and internal fertilization. The findings support the idea that early Bilateria used internal fertilization with direct sperm transfer, challenging the widely accepted theory that they were free-spawning, triploblastic organisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Evolutionary Biology"}
