The researchers used horseradish peroxidase to label cell bodies in the renal and hindpaw innervated ganglia. They found that dopaminergic neurons are relatively restricted in their distribution, located between T8 and L1 and L7 and S2 of the paravertebral chain and in some prevertebral ganglia. These neurons are involved in the innervation of the kidney and hindlimb, and their presence is indicated by a raised dopamine to noradrenaline concentration ratio.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
