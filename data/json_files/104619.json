He found that the water rises and falls differently near the shore and at a distance, and that the strength of the wind influences the height of the tides. He also discussed the stream's direction and velocity, the formation of eddies, and their potential benefits for ships and boats. These observations could help improve navigation and understanding of tidal phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
