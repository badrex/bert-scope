They observe the development of ionization from the start of the primary avalanche to the intense filamentary discharge channel. The results indicate that the development of breakdown in electro-negative gases like oxygen and sulphur hexafluoride is not fully described by existing theories of ionization growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrical and Optical Physics"}
