The author uses group theory to classify the states and examine the contributions to the Hamiltonian. The lowest energy level of the two iridium-chlorine complexes breaks up into a singlet and a triplet, with the singlet-triplet separation related to various exchange integrals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Inorganic Chemistry"}
