They used centripetal cobalt filling to identify the somata and afferent fibers in various lobes of the Octopus brain. The study found that the efferent pathways from the magnocellular lobe control the movement of the whole animal, and the afferent fibers from the arms reach the superior frontal and subvertical lobes, which play a part in tactile learning.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neurobiology"}
