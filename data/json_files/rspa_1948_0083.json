The researchers found that different materials respond to impact in various ways, with deformation occurring through the formation of compression bands, cracks, or plastic deformation. The results provide insights into the mechanisms of deformation under high-velocity impacts and help understand the behavior of metals during collisions.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
