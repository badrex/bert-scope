They found that radon is the \"softest\" of the inert molecules and that radon-argon molecules are the closest approach to the Maxwellian case yet studied experimentally. This research provides valuable information on the molecular field of radon, which cannot be obtained directly through other methods due to the small amount of gas available.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
