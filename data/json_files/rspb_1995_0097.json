Eusociality refers to animal societies where some individuals forego direct reproduction to help others reproduce. The eusociality index measures the decrease in direct reproduction of group members due to altruistic acts directed towards other members. This index complements the reproductive skew index, which only considers the reproductive division of labor, by also taking into account the amount of alloparental help provided by individuals in a society.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Animal Behavior"}
