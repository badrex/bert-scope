He explains how the interference of two light portions, one reflected from a fiber and the other bending around its opposite side, creates colored fringes. He also discusses the colored halos surrounding a distant light source when looking through a lock of wool or water particles. Furthermore, he suggests that every refractive medium transmits light in two separate portions, which re-unite after each separation, leading to a more simple and satisfactory explanation of color dispersion by refraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
