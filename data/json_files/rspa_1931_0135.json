The authors found that the fall in interfacial tension starts at around pH 5.5 and extends over a range of 4 pH units, which is significant for living matter. The study provides insights into the ionization of interfaces in living cells and the dissociation constant of ionizable groups in an interface.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
