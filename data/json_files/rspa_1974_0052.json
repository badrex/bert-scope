The researchers found that the mutarotation reaction likely occurs through a concerted mechanism involving two or more water molecules in the transition state. The findings provide insights into the behavior of amino sugars and their importance in metabolism.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
