The author analyzes the wave velocities and their relationship with ocean depth and water configuration. The study highlights the differences in wave velocities and magnitudes between the two events, providing valuable insights into the behavior of these natural phenomena.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
