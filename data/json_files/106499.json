The pump features a unique valve system and a mechanism for lifting the valve, enabling more accurate and efficient experiments. The author also provides an alternative mechanism for the lower part of the instrument, which is simpler and serves the same purpose.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
