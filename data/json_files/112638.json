The authors conduct experiments with different materials and thicknesses of disks, concluding that the heating effect is not caused by rotation under the Earth's magnetic force or heat conduction from the bearings. The findings contribute to understanding the physics of rotating objects and their heating properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
