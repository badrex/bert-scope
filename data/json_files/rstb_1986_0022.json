It explores the multidimensionality of their life cycles, the relationship between individual size and age, variations in reproduction, and the tendency towards philopatric dispersal. The article highlights the importance of understanding the genetic structure of clonal populations and their evolutionary consequences.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology and Evolution"}
