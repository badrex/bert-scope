The non-hydrostatic figure of the Moon and the requirement that mascons must be supported, along with the high heat-flow, imply that the Moon's metal is collected in the core, likely amounting to less than 1% of the Moon's mass. The authors argue that the fission origin of the Moon is geochemically plausible.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Lunar Geology"}
