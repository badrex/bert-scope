They consider two situations: fluid dispersion in the absence of molecular diffusion and fluid dispersion due to the combined action of convection and radial molecular diffusion. The results show that the effective dispersion coefficient is influenced by the rheological flow-behavior index of the Ostwald-de Waele fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
