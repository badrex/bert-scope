It explains how the antigenic structures associated with these systems are carbohydrates and are secondary products of the blood group genes. The article also describes the role of genes in the formation of these structures and the enzymes that control their biosynthesis. Furthermore, it highlights the importance of understanding the biochemical pathways for the biosynthesis of blood group antigens in the context of malignant transformation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Biochemistry"}
