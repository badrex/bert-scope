The authors introduce the concept of the hydroxyl bond, which is a new type of interatomic force that occurs between hydroxyl ions. They analyze the crystal structures of various compounds where this bond is present and explain its nature by considering the probable configurations of the hydroxyl ion in different ionic environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Intermolecular forces and chemical bonding"}
