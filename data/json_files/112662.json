He used Fraunhofer's direct measures of wave lengths and converted them into parts of the millimeter. The author compared his computed wave lengths with direct measures by Angstr\u00f6m and Ditscheiner, finding a very small discrepancy. The study provides a way to find wave lengths for any line using computed wave lengths from this memoir.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
