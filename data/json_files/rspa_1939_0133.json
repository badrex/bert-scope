They find that these peroxides decompose differently at various temperatures and pressures, with some decomposing heterogeneously and others luminously. The author also studies the reaction rates and products of these decompositions, providing insights into the properties and behavior of alkyl peroxides.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
