The controller consists of wall-mounted shear stress sensors and thermoelectric actuators that alter the fluid's viscosity by modulating the adjacent wall temperature. This control strategy can delay the transition from laminar to turbulent flow and enhance mixing in various applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Dynamics"}
