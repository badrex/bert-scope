They argue that the present author's formula for electrode potential accurately represents the free energy of gaseous ionization of atoms. They also refute Mr. Butler's criticism, explaining that his cycle is incorrect due to transferring electrons over the metal-solution-vapour interface instead of the dry metallic surface outside the cell. The correct treatment leads to the same relation between electrode potential, basic, and ionization constants, providing further proof of the correctness of the present author's deductions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
