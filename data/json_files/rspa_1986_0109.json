They use multipole expansions and a generalized Rayleigh identity to derive a set of linear equations for the multipole coefficients, which help calculate the transport coefficients. The research focuses on two structures, one isotropic (caesium chloride) and the other anisotropic (composed of filaments or chains).", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Materials Science"}
