They found that these salts significantly affect the kidney's secretion process, leading to changes in the composition of the urine. The study highlights the importance of understanding the relationship between these salts and kidney function for better treatment of kidney-related diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
