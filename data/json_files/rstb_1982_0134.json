These proteins, including MAP1 and MAP2, are found to be associated with microtubules and have similar properties to erythrocyte membrane proteins. The study suggests that the organization of proteins in the membrane-cytoskeleton complex of erythrocytes has direct relevance to other types of cells, and that there may be families of proteins related to spectrin and ankyrin.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
