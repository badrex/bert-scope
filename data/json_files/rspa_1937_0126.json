They used a space-charge detector and an ionization gauge to analyze the ionization potentials, which are important for understanding chemical reactions and identifying free radicals. This research provided valuable data and insights into the behavior of free radicals in chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical reactions and kinetics"}
