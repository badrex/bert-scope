They found that dextrin is an efficient source of energy for both organisms, and basic slag is an effective neutralizing agent that also increases nitrogen fixation. A simple nutrient medium for both organisms is achieved by adding dextrin, di-potassium phosphate, magnesium sulfate, and basic slag to distilled water.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
