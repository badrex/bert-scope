The risky securities are modeled as correlated geometric Brownian motions, and the aim is to maximize the long-term growth rate. The authors transform the complex free boundary problem into a simpler one, making it feasible to solve with numerical methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics"}
