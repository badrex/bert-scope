The results show that the isotherms for argon on charcoal are linear, suggesting that the process is not influenced by surface conditions. The authors also discuss the challenges of maintaining constant temperatures and achieving true equilibrium in low-temperature experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Adsorption and Surface Chemistry"}
