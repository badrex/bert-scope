They found that activity is dependent on nest architecture and changes when ants construct their own nests. The study suggests that spatial patterns may be crucial in the organization of ant colonies, as they can influence the allocation of brood care and task distribution.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
