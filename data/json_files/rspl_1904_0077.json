Radium emanations also alter the body color of the diamond, changing it from yellow to a pale blue-green. This phenomenon is due to the intense phosphorescence of the diamond in the presence of radium, which may be a result of chemical as well as physical action.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Radioactivity"}
