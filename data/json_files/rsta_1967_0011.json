It explores temperature and velocity modulation techniques in MHD systems, including steady flow and non-steady flow methods. The author also describes the potential advantages of oscillatory systems, such as improved thermodynamic cycles and higher power densities. The article highlights the importance of understanding and optimizing MHD power extraction for efficient energy generation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
