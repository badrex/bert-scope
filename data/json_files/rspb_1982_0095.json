Results show that early regenerating axons experience considerable broadening of the action potential after 4-AP application, while late regenerating axons give rise to burst activity following a single stimulus. These findings demonstrate the importance of potassium conductance in stabilizing firing properties of myelinated regenerating axons.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
