Heavily parasitized females were found to make fewer mate inspections and were more likely to choose lower-quality mates than lightly parasitized females. This discovery suggests that parasites may have a negative impact on female choosiness, potentially limiting the role of parasites in sexual selection and the evolution of male secondary sexual traits.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Fish Behavior"}
