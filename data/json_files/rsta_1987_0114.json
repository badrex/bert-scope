The authors found that strong temperature gradients, referred to as \"fronts,\" developed in the stratosphere during the warming. These fronts were similar to those observed in the upper troposphere, and their presence highlights the importance of better spatial resolution in understanding the complex dynamics of the middle atmosphere.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
