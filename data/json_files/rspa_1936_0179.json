They found that the random electron current density is usually many times the anode current density, and the electron temperature can be calculated from the slope of the voltage curve. This method allowed them to study the temperature dependence of electrical conductivity in semi-conductors.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electricity and Magnetism"}
