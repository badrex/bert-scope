They identified neurofibrillar-staining horizontal cells as the A-type horizontal cells of Golgi-staining and measured the changes in density and dendritic field size of these cells with respect to retinal eccentricity. They found that each retinal point is covered by the dendritic fields of three or four A-type horizontal cells, and the density ratio of B-type to A-type horizontal cells is 2.8 \u00b1 0.4.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
