It examines the pressure-time curves for various wedge angles and incident pulse types, finding that the attenuation of pressure is not as large as that due to a half-plane, and the shapes of the curves are very similar. The pressure at the summit of a wedge is found to be greater than the incident pressure, leading to interesting conclusions about the behavior of sound waves in wedge-shaped structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
