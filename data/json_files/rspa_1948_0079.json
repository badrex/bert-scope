They demonstrate that in certain circumstances, the electrical resistance to flow due to an electrical potential gradient on the ions at the surface layers can be significant compared to the mechanical resistance. This effect can lead to an increase in the apparent viscosity of the liquid, impacting the rate of flow and the stability of liquid films between surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid dynamics"}
