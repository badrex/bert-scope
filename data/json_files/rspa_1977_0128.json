They demonstrated that an accurate limiting solution can be obtained for the parabolic rate constant for scale growth. By combining this with existing equations, they provided a complete analytical description of scale growth, allowing for the calculation of relevant parameters for various binary alloys. The analysis also established general patterns of behavior and discussed the relation between cation distribution and the precipitation of a second phase.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Corrosion and Protection"}
