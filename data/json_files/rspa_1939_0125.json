They measured nearly 2000 lines and analyzed the spectrum, discovering that it has a similar vibrational scheme to other alkali-metal hydrides. The study provides insights into the electronic transitions and molecular constants of rubidium hydride.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Spectroscopy"}
