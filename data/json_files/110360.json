He found that these lines follow definite and general laws, and their inflexions and curvatures present systems of great regularity. Barlow also observed the progressive changes in these lines and their agreement with the hypothesis of a revolution of the magnetic poles for each place around the poles of the Earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
