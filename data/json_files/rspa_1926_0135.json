They employed carbon dioxide snow to achieve low temperatures and developed techniques for preparing smooth surfaces for examination. The study focused on the ternary amalgams of silver, tin, and mercury, which are used as filling materials in dental practice.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Materials Science"}
