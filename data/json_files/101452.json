He suggests inverting the telescope and adding a convex eyepiece to make objects appear erect and distinct. Auzout also discusses the mathematics behind determining the focus and distance of objects using two telescopes with known focal lengths. He offers to share his secret for measuring distances if Mr. Hook shares his telescope design.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
