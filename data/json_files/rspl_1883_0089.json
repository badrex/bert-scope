The authors found that the intensity of force required to produce a discharge between a point and a disk or two points becomes constant after a certain potential is reached. They also discuss the striking distances and the potential required for a discharge between a cloud and the earth.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electrochemistry"}
