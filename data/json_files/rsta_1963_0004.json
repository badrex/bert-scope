It discusses various resonance testing techniques and their underlying assumptions, with a focus on hysteretic damping. The article provides a theoretical background for understanding resonance tests and their applications in fields like aeronautical engineering.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Mechanical Engineering"}
