They highlight three studies that demonstrate the influence of host factors on the production of virulence determinants in bacteria, such as iron limitation, erythritol, and CMP-NANA. The author emphasizes the need to examine bacteria grown in vivo to better understand and combat microbial diseases.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
