They use a pendulum-driven drum with a graduated paper strip and a microscope to count the number of vibrations in a given time. The results are compared for different tuning forks, and the effects of temperature, continuous and intermittent bowing, and fixing methods are discussed.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
