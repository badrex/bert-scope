The research shows that when there is a small heat transfer through the sidewalls, the bifurcation is replaced by a smooth transition to finite amplitude convection, ensuring the motion's stability. The findings apply to more realistic models, expanding our understanding of fluid dynamics and heat transfer processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
