They found that the medium-sized lacteals contain smooth muscle nuclei and fibers, which play a role in the contraction of the lacteals. In contrast, smaller lacteals and those from squirrels do not contain smooth muscle elements, suggesting that contraction in these vessels may be independent of muscle. The study provides insights into the anatomy and function of the mammalian lymphatic system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
