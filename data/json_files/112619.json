They found that this reaction could be completed in about half an hour at a temperature below boiling water. The mixture was then boiled to expel excess ammonia and distilled from potash, resulting in pure ethylamine, alcohol, and water in the distillate.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
