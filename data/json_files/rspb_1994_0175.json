This hypothesis is supported by evidence from various organisms, including isogamous and anisogamous species. The author also discusses the implications of the conflict hypothesis for the evolution of uniparental transmission and inheritance of cytoplasmic factors.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
