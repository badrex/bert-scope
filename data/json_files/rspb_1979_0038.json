The research shows that the owl's visual Wulst has a hierarchical organization that produces increasingly sophisticated requirements for stimulus orientation, movement, and binocular disparity. The study also reveals similarities in the functional organization between avian and mammalian systems, despite their different evolutionary origins.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
