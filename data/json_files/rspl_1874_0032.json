The deeper layer, called the claviform tissue, is believed to represent a nervous system, while the superficial layer is considered an epidermis. The author also describes the unique structure of the tentacles and the presence of a sensory apparatus, which may be an early stage of sight and touch differentiation. Additionally, the paper discusses the reproductive process of Myriothela, including the formation of ova, fecundation, and the development of a planula embryo.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cnidaria"}
