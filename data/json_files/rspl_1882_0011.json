They compared two different types of actinometers, one designed by Rev. G. C. Hodgkinson and the other by Professor Balfour Stewart. The author found that the Stewart's instrument was more sensitive and preferred for future observations. The study provides insights into the atmospheric conditions and the effectiveness of different instruments in measuring solar radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
