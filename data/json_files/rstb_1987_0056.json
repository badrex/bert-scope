The authors describe the cloning of a nifHDK cluster and the identification of two other nif clusters. They also explore the regulation of nitrogen fixation, including the role of glutamine synthetase, and the interaction between Azospirillum and plants. The findings contribute to our understanding of nitrogen-fixing bacteria and their potential applications in agriculture.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
