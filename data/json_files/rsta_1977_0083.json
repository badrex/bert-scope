It discusses the origin of water in lunar samples, the effects of isotopic fractionation, and the implications of oxygen isotope evidence for the Earth-Moon system's origin. The article concludes that the bulk of the hydrogen in lunar soils comes from solar wind protons, while the water found in lunar samples is likely due to terrestrial contamination. Recent oxygen isotope studies suggest that the Earth-Moon system has a different origin from higher-temperature condensates in chondritic meteorites.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
