The authors found that MHC-based mating preferences, which help avoid inbreeding, are more important in maintaining genetic variety than pathogen-driven selection. These findings suggest that inbreeding avoidance is the primary force diversifying MHC genes in species with similar mating patterns.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Evolution"}
