The author analyzes the flow in a bend with a repeatedly reversed radius of curvature, obtaining a variety of solutions for different entry conditions. The results are compared with experimental observations of air flow through various pipe configurations.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid Mechanics"}
