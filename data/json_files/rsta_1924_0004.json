The author develops a theory and conducts experiments to determine the effect of the cable's magnetic field on the surrounding environment. The results are useful for understanding the behavior of submarine cables and improving their design and efficiency.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Electrical Engineering"}
