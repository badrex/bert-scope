The device records changes in stomatal porosity by measuring the velocity of air passing through the leaf tissues under constant pressure. This innovation allowed for precise and sensitive air-pump measurements, providing valuable insights into plant-water relationships and the impact of environmental factors on stomatal behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
