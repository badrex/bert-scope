The authors describe their work at the International Scientific Station of the Jungfraujoch, which is known for its excellent location for observing the solar spectrum in the water-vapor absorption regions. They also discuss the use of a double-pass arrangement with a narrow intermediate slit to improve the apparatus function and the correction for the effect of the instrumental profile.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
