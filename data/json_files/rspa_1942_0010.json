Researchers investigated the chain-thermal theory of reactions between hydrogen and oxygen sensitized by nitrogen peroxide or nitrosyl chloride. They also explored the self-consistent field for methane, the second virial and viscosity coefficients of gaseous helium, and the arrangement of long-chain organic molecules using electron diffraction patterns. Additionally, the paper discusses the transition from laminar to turbulent flow in boundary layers on streamline bodies of revolution in a water stream.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
