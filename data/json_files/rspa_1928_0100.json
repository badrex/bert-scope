The authors examine weak and strong electric fields and their impact on the energy levels and wavefunctions of the hydrogen atom. The study provides a deeper understanding of the behavior of hydrogen atoms under the influence of electric fields and contributes to the development of theories in atomic physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic Physics"}
