He also observed that the corpus callosum is made of small fibers from the spinal cord's medulla. Malpighi found that half or a third of an animal's blood goes into the brain, where it cannot be consumed, but the finest serum is filtered through the exterior part and enters the brain's fibers, then into the nerves. He examined the optic nerve in various animals, discovering that fish have a unique structure compared to terrestrial animals. Malpighi also discovered small papillary eminences in the tongue, which he believes are the primary organ of taste. Lastly, he mentioned Fracassati's observation about the tongue's cavities and nerves, suggesting that the finest part of the aliment passes directly from the tongue into the nerves.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
