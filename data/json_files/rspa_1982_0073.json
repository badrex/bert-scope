The authors discovered that oscillations occur in a region typically associated with ignition and found that proper conditioning of the reaction vessel allows long trains of oscillations to be generated. They also explored the nature of the emitted light and discussed the theoretical background of the reaction mechanisms involved.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics and reaction mechanisms"}
