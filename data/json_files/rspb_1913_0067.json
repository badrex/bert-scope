They discovered that certain lower centres in the brain control postural activities of the limbs, and that stimulation of the mid-brain can evoke specific postures in the animals. The study provides insights into the functioning of the motor cortex and neural pathways.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
