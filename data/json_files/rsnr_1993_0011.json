Sir Bernard Lovell, Dr. D.G. King-Hele, and T.L. Eckersley exchanged letters discussing the potential of radar techniques to investigate high-energy cosmic ray air showers. Their correspondence and research laid the foundation for the creation of Jodrell Bank, which has since contributed significantly to the field of radio astronomy.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Astronomy"}
