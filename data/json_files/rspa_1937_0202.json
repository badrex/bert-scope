The author finds that nitric oxide suppresses reaction chains by removing free radicals, and the decomposition is significantly slowed down. The study also examines the relationship between the mean chain length and ethane pressure, as well as the temperature coefficient of the inhibited reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
