Short, conducted observations on a diagonal barometer and its spirit of wine thermometer during a significant frost in 1739. He found that the cold was so intense that the mercury sank 21 divisions below the freezing point within a room. Short also compared the temperature inside and outside the room in 1767 and 1768, noting that the cold was greater outside by 6 to 8 divisions of Fahrenheit's scale. This study helped establish the freezing point and the scale of temperature measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Climate and Meteorology"}
