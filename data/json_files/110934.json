F. Stevenson, argues against the existence of two electric fluids and proposes that all electrical phenomena can be explained by a single fluid. The fluid's behavior depends on whether it is present in a conducting or non-conducting body, and the form of the conductor can change its properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
