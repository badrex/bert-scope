(Diptera, Syrphidae)", "semantic_tags": ["Sexual Dimorphism", "Hoverflies", "Morphology", "Insect Biology", "Evolutionary Biology"], "tldr": "The author examines size and shape differences within and between male and female hoverflies of the species Syrphus ribesii L. Males have shorter, broader wings, a larger thorax, and a narrower abdomen than females. The labellum size is closely correlated with body size in males, but varies more independently in females. These differences may be due to factors such as thermoregulation and mating behavior.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Entomology"}
