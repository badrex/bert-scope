It found that even early hypophysectomy after copulation does not inhibit ovulation. The corpus luteum fails to develop in hypophysectomized ferrets, and the uterus shows no signs of pseudopregnant development. This suggests that the ovulation-producing hormone is secreted into the circulation rapidly after copulation."}
