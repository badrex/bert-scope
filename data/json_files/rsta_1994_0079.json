The authors explain how lamellae are not all equivalent and that their mutual disposition is crucial for the overall structure. They also describe the distortion of lamellae during growth and the influence of factors such as temperature and time on the resulting texture.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Polymer Science"}
