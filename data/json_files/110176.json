The results indicated a constant inflexion of the magnetic pole towards the sun during the day, suggesting that the sun is the primary agent in producing these changes. The study also provided insights into the radius of the circle of rotation of the earth's polarizing axis.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geomagnetism"}
