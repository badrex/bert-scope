They discovered that the resting nucleus has a Feulgen-negative nucleolus and Feulgen-positive chromatin granules. The author proposed creating two new families, Schizopyrenidae and Hartmannellidae, based on the types of nuclear division observed. This new classification system aims to improve the understanding of the order Amoebida's phylogeny and evolutionary history.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cellular Biology"}
