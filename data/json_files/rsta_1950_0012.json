They explain that suitable conditions of wave interference may occur at the center of a cyclonic depression or possibly if there is wave reflection from a coast. This theory is supported by observations of Bernard and Deacon, who discovered that the period of microseisms is often half that of the ocean waves associated with them.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geophysics"}
