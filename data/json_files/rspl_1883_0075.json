The author considers three problems related to these phenomena, including the currents generated over a vibrating plate, the color phenomena observed by Sedley Taylor on liquid films, and the air currents observed by Dvorak in a Kundt's tube. The study takes into account the compressibility of the fluid and the influence of friction on the motion of the fluid.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
