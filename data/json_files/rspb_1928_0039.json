They found that the parasites primarily affected the joints, testes, and lymphatic glands, with minimal enlargement of the spleen. The study also revealed differences in the course of infection between the Chinese and Tunisian strains of Leishmania, suggesting they may be distinct varieties or species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Parasitology"}
