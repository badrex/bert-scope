The author uses the WKBJ approximation and phase integral methods to study how waves are trapped by ducts and propagate to conjugate points. A new type of mode called a quasi-trapped mode is discussed, which selectively traps certain components of a wave packet, allowing them to travel considerable distances before leaking from the duct.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
