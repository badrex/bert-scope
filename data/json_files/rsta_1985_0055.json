They apply this theory to the Lake of Lugano, Switzerland, and find that the observed oscillations in temperature and current records can be explained by a fundamental-mode topographic wave traveling around the lake. The energy source for this wave is likely the wind along the shore at the southern end of the lake.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Fluid Dynamics"}
