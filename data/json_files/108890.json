They found that the fauna in these regions consists of various species like Orbulina, Globigerina, and Lagena, among others. The authors also discussed the distribution of these species in different zones and compared them with the Foraminifera fauna in other seas. This research provides valuable information for understanding the distribution of Foraminifera in different environments and their significance in geology and biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
