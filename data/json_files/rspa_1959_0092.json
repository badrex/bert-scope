The method is applicable to electrons in heavy atoms and is designed for the case of large atomic numbers. The authors demonstrate the practicality of this method by calculating the Lamb shift of a 2s-electron in mercury and discuss the potential for checking quantum mechanical techniques in strong fields.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
