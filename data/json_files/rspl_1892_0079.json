The author, Lord Kelvin, calculates the velocity and density of the cathode stream and compares it to Crookes' experiments. He also addresses objections to Crookes' doctrine of the cathode stream and concludes that the test has no validity as an objection.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Plasma Physics"}
