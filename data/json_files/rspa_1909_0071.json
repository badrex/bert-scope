They found that the radiation in a plane containing the primary rays and the radiator passes through a minimum at right angles to the primary rays. The results showed that the want of symmetry in the distribution of force with respect to the direction of acceleration of the electron gave rise to the term polarization, and that the extent of polarization was affected by secondary radiation being absorbed, leading to tertiary radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
