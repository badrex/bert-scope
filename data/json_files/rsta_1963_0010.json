They discuss the sound produced by a distribution of convected acoustic quadrupoles and how the radiated intensity increases with velocity. The theory is developed in detail and supported by physical arguments, and the paper concludes with a section discussing relevant experimental evidence.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Acoustics"}
