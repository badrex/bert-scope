The research focuses on the relationship between range size, woodiness versus non-woodiness, tree versus shrub life forms, and other factors such as overall plant size, pollination, and dispersal types. The results suggest that trees have larger range sizes than shrubs, and wind-pollinated species have larger range sizes than non-wind-pollinated species. Additionally, non-clonal plants are more widespread than clonal species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Ecology"}
