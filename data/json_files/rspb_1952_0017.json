This factor is present in acetone leaf extracts and is essential for the reduction process. The factor is thermolabile, not dialyzable, and can be precipitated with nearly saturated ammonium sulfate. It is stable between pH 5 and 9 at 20\u00b0C, suggesting that it may be a protein. The rate of hydrogen transfer in the reduction of methemoglobin by the factor and chloroplasts is similar to the direct oxygen-producing reaction with artificial hydrogen-accepting reagents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis"}
