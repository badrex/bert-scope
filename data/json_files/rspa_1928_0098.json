The author demonstrates how to obtain an upper bound to the fundamental frequency and the first overtone using various functions satisfying the boundary conditions. The article also discusses the concept of spectrum, whether it is a line spectrum or a band spectrum, and the existence of multiple solutions associated with characteristic numbers.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Mechanics"}
