The comet's nucleus was initially bright and distinct, but it became indistinct, making its measurement uncertain. The tail of the comet appeared to split, and its angle and position changed over time. The observations and sketches of the comet's appearance accompanied Hall's communication.", "scientific_discipline": "Astronomy > Celestial mechanics"}
