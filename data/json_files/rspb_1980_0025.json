It explores the dimensions and arrangement of ommatidia, which determine the fields of view of photoreceptor cells. The author also explains how the fields of view overlap and how this affects the insect's ability to see patterns and movements. Maps of actual fields are analyzed to understand the visual capabilities of these insects and their potential applications in electrophysiological analysis.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Zoology"}
