They used the Marchi method to demonstrate the connections and degeneration of these tracts and found that the fibres of Forel's decussation and the arcuate system are closely related. This research contributes to the understanding of the anatomy and function of these important brain structures.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Brain anatomy"}
