His research on the eel's heart led to discoveries on sino-ventricular rhythm, the influence of one part of the heart muscle on another, and the conditions that could block the spread of contraction waves. MacWilliam later focused on mammalian hearts, studying conditions like ventricular fibrillation and auricular flutter. Despite his groundbreaking work, his contributions were not fully recognized until later in his life.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
