The research demonstrates that flanking sequences for microsatellite motifs are highly conserved over a span of 470 million years, suggesting that these sequences may play an important role in eukaryotic genomes and are under strong selective constraints. The findings indicate that heterologous primers can be a valuable source of polymorphic markers among fish species, but caution should be used when comparing variability across species.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
