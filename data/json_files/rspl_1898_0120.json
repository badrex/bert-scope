They show that various metals and organic bodies can produce similar results when replaced with hydrogen peroxide. The author also discusses the conditions under which metals and organic bodies act on photographic plates and how to obtain pictures of the structure of paper, skeleton leaves, lace, and other materials.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Photographic chemistry"}
