The author examines the effects of sodium vanadate on bacteria, germinating seeds, fungi, and infusorians, and then studies its impact on the animal system through subcutaneous injection and ingestion. The results show that vanadium has a toxic effect on the respiratory muscles and can cause paralysis, while the heart and nervous system remain relatively unaffected.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Toxicology"}
