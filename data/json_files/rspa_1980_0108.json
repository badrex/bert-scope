The author applies this formalism to an ideal electrodynamic medium, demonstrating that the resulting theory can be given a variational form. The theory is useful for describing the mechanics of continuous media, particularly in the context of perfect electromagnetic media and the detection of gravitational waves.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
