It shows that the rate of recovery is rapid during the first 10 minutes after exercise, then gradually decreases until complete recovery. The recovery process is divided into two phases: a short phase of rapid recovery followed by a phase where the recovery process slows down. The study also highlights the importance of individual differences in recovery time and the need for personalized recovery strategies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Exercise Physiology"}
