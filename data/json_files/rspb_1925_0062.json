They measured both tension and heat produced during muscle contractions when stimulating different nerve roots separately and together. The results showed that the sum of the tensions developed was higher than when stimulating all roots at once, confirming previous findings. However, the sum of the heats produced was almost equal to the heat obtained by stimulating all components together, suggesting that the previous findings might be due to the minute structure of the muscle rather than pluri-segmental innervation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Physiology"}
