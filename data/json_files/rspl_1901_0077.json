They found that exposure to the temperature of liquid air did not destroy the virulence of the sputum, but it was possible that a higher temperature might have a modifying effect on the organism. The author also observed that 80% of the experimental animals were affected by tuberculosis, with the respiratory system being the most affected organ.", "scientific_discipline": "Medicine and Health Sciences > Infectious Diseases"}
