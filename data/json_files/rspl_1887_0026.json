The transmitter works by cooling the platinum wire when air vibrations occur in a slit, which changes its electrical resistance and sends a signal to a receiving telephone. The sound quality is not perfect but still intelligible, and the author discusses various improvements and potential applications of the device.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Telecommunications"}
