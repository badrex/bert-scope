They present the theoretical predictions of the rock-breaking process based on fracture mechanics and compare them with results from a scale model. The study shows that the breaking force is proportional to the hole depth and the fracture energy, making the process more efficient than conventional percussive drilling.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Rock Breaking and Excavation"}
