He describes the construction of an electrochemical actinometer and the effects of different substances on the production of electric currents. The author also explains the importance of the form and position of the poles in the cell and the selective absorption, concentration, and conductivity of the fluid. He intends to present a more comprehensive investigation in the future.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Electrochemistry"}
