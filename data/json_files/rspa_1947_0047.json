It introduces expinors, an extension of symmetric spinors, which can be used to describe the transformation properties of wave functions of spinning particles. The study also discusses the conditions for a representation to be unitary and the connection between spinors and the Lorentz group.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Group Theory"}
