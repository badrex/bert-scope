It highlights the sensitivity of cell growth to water stress and the importance of understanding the physicochemical basis for the transduction of small changes in water status into alterations in metabolism. The article also examines recent field data on seasonal and diurnal adjustments and vertical water-potential gradients in plant canopies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Physiology"}
