Researchers used float trajectories and hydrographic data to study the dynamics of the currents and compare them to geostrophic current profiles. The study found that the mean current at different depths could differ significantly, and that discrepancies between directly observed and computed geostrophic currents can be accounted for by observational errors and expected variability.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
