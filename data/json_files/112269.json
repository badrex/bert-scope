Hofmann, discovered a new ammonia derivative called Martylamine during the manufacture of aniline. Martylamine is a tertiary monamine with unique properties, and its formula is C6H11N. It is closely related to benzidine, another important base in organic chemistry. The author also discusses the reactions and substitutions of Martylamine, including its resistance to certain reactions and its formation of red crystals with nitrous acid.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
