It consists of Mesozoic and Tertiary sedimentary rocks and has experienced various tectonic events, including rift, passive-margin, active-margin, strike-slip, and uplift phases. The lineament's history involves the formation of a small ocean basin, subduction, and multiple deformation events. This lineament provides valuable insights into the geological evolution of the eastern Mediterranean area.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
