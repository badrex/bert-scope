They found that a higher speed is needed to maintain turbulence in curved pipes compared to straight pipes, verifying Mr. C.M. White's previous findings. The experiments also showed that turbulence can disappear in the curved part of the pipe, which cannot be detected by previous methods.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
