They overcome the challenges of boundary conditions and electrical interactions by applying fictitious boundary conditions and considering the crystal block as part of an infinite lattice. The normal frequencies are determined by solving the frequency equations and finding the intersections of planes with four-dimensional frequency surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid State Physics"}
