The research explores the impact load, deformation patterns, and the role of the liquid's compressible behavior and high-speed flow on solid surfaces. The findings have implications for understanding the erosion of aircraft and turbine blades.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
