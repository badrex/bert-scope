They found that the clock's rate was affected by temperature and moisture, with January and February showing the most significant retardation and July and August the most significant acceleration. The author also observed the disappearance and reappearance of Saturn's ring and noted that the magnifying power of 100 seemed to show the thread of the ring more visibly than 150.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Meteorology"}
