Two models are developed based on variants of Boussinesq's equations, which describe the evolution of wave amplitudes and phases in the shoaling region. The models accurately predict Fourier coefficients of the wave field for different data sets, indicating that nonlinear effects play a significant role in wave shoaling. The findings have implications for understanding wave transformations and coastal processes.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
