The authors found that the platinum surface serves as an invariant substrate for iodine deposition and evaporation, which follows an exponential unimolecular law. The study provides insights into the adsorption and evaporation processes of surface films on metals.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
