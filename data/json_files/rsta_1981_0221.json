The authors extend a previous reaction scheme to include deuterium chemistry and isomeric forms, and they present the results of numerical integration of the 108 coupled kinetic equations involved in the extended scheme. Calculated concentrations at a molecular cloud age of 10 million years are within the experimental uncertainties for 11 of the 14 species for which suitable observational data are available. Predicted values of HX/DX ratios fall into three broad groups around the accepted cosmic ratio, and observations are broadly in agreement.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Astrochemistry"}
