The authors propose a new perspective on the dynamics of turbulence, integrating Kolmogorov's theory with intermittency effects. They develop a quantitative model for the statistics of homogeneous turbulent flows, considering mean-distortion and self-distortion of eddies as key processes affecting energy transfer from large to small scales.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
