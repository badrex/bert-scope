They discovered that when the electrodes were oppositely magnetized, green patches vanished, and a hazy blue cloud formed between the points. A luminous ring appeared within the bulb when the electrodes were magnetized, and this ring was sensitive to variations in the charge on the glass walls. The authors also observed that the direction of rotation of the glow could be reversed by reversing the polarity of the magnetized electrode.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Electromagnetism"}
