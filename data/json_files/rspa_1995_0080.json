They study the effects of various parameters, such as mixture composition, optical beam diameter, and physical properties of the absorption and heat transfer processes. The model helps predict critical conditions for ignition and provides insights into the safety of using optical fibers in hazardous environments.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Combustion and Fire Safety"}
