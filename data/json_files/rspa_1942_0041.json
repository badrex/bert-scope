They explore four cases: uniform hydrostatic pressure, tension in one axis, shear along planes, and shear along lattice planes. The theory predicts several second-order effects, some of which have been observed and measured by Bridgman. By comparing calculated values with experimental results, the unknown force law between particles in the lattice could be determined.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Solid Mechanics"}
