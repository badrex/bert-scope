They discovered that presynaptic ribbons in the optic lobe's monopolar cells, such as L2, undergo invagination and become free-floating organelles when their target neurons degenerate. This process is the first step in synaptic loss and helps to understand the mechanisms behind synaptic site removal in the nervous system.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
