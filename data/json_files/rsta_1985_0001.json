The authors explore the effect of supercoiling on DNA structure and function, and discuss the potential of circular dichroism as a non-destructive and accurate method for measuring superhelix density. They provide a theoretical explanation of the experimental spectra and consider the role of secondary, tertiary, and curvature effects on the optical activity of DNA.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
