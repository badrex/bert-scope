The authors derive a closed explicit form for the functional integral and obtain equations that solve the problem in weak and strong coupling, providing a basis for an intermediate coupling solution. The study contributes to understanding the behavior of nucleons and mesons in particle physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
