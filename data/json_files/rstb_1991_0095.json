They described the larval, polygastric, and eudoxid stages, determining their duration and rate of production. The study provides insights into the species' life cycle and ecological implications, which can help understand the seasonal distribution and abundance of siphonophores in marine ecosystems.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
