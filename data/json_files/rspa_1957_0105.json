The authors provide detailed observations and analysis of dislocation pile-ups, movement, and interactions with twin boundaries. They also discuss the formation and removal of stacking faults, which play a crucial role in the material's behavior under stress.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Stainless Steel Deformation Mechanisms"}
