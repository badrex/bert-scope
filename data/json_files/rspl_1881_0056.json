They define molecular volume and discuss how atomic volumes form the basis for understanding molecular volumes in compounds. The author also presents propositions and evidence to support their findings, emphasizing that elements can assume different volumes in various compounds, and these volumes have a simple numerical proportion.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical Bonding and Molecular Geometry"}
