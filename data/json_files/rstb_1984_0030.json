The authors explore the structure, inheritance, and gene families of these proteins, as well as the mRNA species involved in their synthesis. They also touch upon the existence of other non-conventional legumin types and their genetic studies.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Molecular Biology"}
