They found that the decomposition of the peroxide into acetone and ethane is affected by the presence of nitric oxide, which forms tertiary butyl nitrite. The reaction mechanism involves the competition between the recombination of methyl radicals with nitric oxide and the spontaneous decomposition of tertiary butoxy radicals. The results provide insights into the reaction rates and the role of nitric oxide in the process.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
