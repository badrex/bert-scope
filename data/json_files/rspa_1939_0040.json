They explain that the transfer effect is a surface phenomenon, which affects the heat transfer and the behavior of helium in contact with solid surfaces. This research contributes to the understanding of helium's unique properties and its applications in cryogenics and low-temperature physics.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Cryogenics"}
