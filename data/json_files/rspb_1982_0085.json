This theory helps to reduce the range of signals each interneuron needs to encode, allowing for better encoding of spatial detail and reducing spatial redundancy. The authors demonstrate that this coding strategy also removes temporal redundancy from the interneuron's output, improving the overall efficiency of the visual system.", "scientific_discipline": "Neuroscience > Visual Processing"}
