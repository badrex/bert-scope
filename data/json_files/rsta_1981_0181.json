The study focuses on the movements and structure of these fronts, their relation to mean circulation, and the impact of tidal mixing and heating on their behavior. The research also explores the complex velocity field observed in these regions, which may be due to large-scale eddies that develop from the instability of the flow.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Oceanography"}
