They aimed to determine the earth's ellipticity and the effects of temperature on the pendulum's vibrations. The results were compared and analyzed, providing insights into the accuracy of the measurements and the importance of similar geological locations for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
