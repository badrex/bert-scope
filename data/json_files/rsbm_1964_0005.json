He discovered that the action potential of a nerve trunk is made up of several components with different time relations, revealing the different groups of fibers within the nerve. Gasser's work had a major impact on the understanding of nerve function and sensation, and he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine in 1943, sharing it with Joseph Erlanger.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
