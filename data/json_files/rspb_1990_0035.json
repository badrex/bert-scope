The model processes real data from an 8-bit monochrome video camera and measures the range and angular position of contrasting objects. It incorporates principles such as lateral inhibition and contrast saturation to improve motion detection and reduce the influence of intensity in the data.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Neuroscience"}
