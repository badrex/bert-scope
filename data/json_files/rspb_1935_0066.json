L. Brown and Sir Henry Dale, explore the pharmacology of ergometrine, a new alkaloid found in ergot. They discuss its structure, extraction, and its effects on various species. Ergometrine has a stimulant action on the uterus and is more effective when administered orally, unlike other known ergot alkaloids. The authors compare ergometrine's toxicity and effects to other ergot alkaloids like ergotoxine and ergotamine, and they also study its impact on body temperature and metabolism."}
