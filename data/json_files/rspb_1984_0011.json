The results show that the Entner-Doudoroff pathway and the pentose phosphate pathway are operative under the specified growth conditions, with 31% and 69% of the glucose metabolized through these pathways, respectively. The study concludes that the Embden-Meyerhoff pathway does not operate in vivo.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
