He describes the preparation and analysis of these compounds, their reactions with acids and other substances, and their potential applications in further research. Buckton also discusses the electro-negative character of these organo-metals and their interactions with other elements, such as sodium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
