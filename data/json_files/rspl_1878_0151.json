They analyze the spectra of various elements, discussing the possibility of impurities and the role of temperature in the formation of spectral lines. The author also explores the concept of rhythm in the formation of spectral lines and its implications for the understanding of elemental bodies.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Optics"}
