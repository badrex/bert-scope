They found that different preparation methods for the membranes led to varying results, and the inconsistent features were not a reliable guide to the pump mechanism. The sodium pump's properties and reactions were demonstrated in different membrane preparations, providing insights into the pump's function.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Cell Biology"}
