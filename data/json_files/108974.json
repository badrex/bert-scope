The comparisons were made to accurately express the length of an arc of parallel in terms of one standard and to determine the figure and dimensions of the Earth. The triangulations of these countries were connected to form a continuous network, enabling a crucial test of the accuracy of the Earth's figure and dimensions.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geodesy"}
