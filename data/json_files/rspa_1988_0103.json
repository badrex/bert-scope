The authors analyze the intrinsic multisingularities and show that they obey asymptotic scaling, which is familiar in the theory of critical phenomena. They provide a practical numerical method for computing the characteristic properties of the dominant singularities, which are essential in many applications.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Approximation Theory"}
