The authors use statistical calculations and thermodynamic treatments to derive adsorption isotherms and analyze the heat of adsorption. They find that when there is a positive interaction energy between adsorbed atoms, there is no critical behavior or point of inflexion in the isotherms. The authors also study the variation of heat of adsorption with the fraction of the surface covered by adsorbed atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Surface chemistry"}
