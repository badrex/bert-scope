They used high-speed interferometric measurements and observed very high crack propagation speeds and high accelerations. A dynamic crack growth criterion for crack growth along bimaterial interfaces is proposed, which is valid in the subsonic regime of crack growth.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
