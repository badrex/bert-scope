They propose a new scheme that requires a further change in the fundamental definitions of twistor diagram theory to produce states of finite norm. This development offers new insights into the relation between broken symmetry and rest mass in the context of twistor geometry.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebra and Geometry"}
