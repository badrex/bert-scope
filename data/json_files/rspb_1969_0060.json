The Kinin System", "semantic_tags": ["Kinin system", "Plasma proteins", "Hypotensive effects", "Vascular permeability", "Enzyme systems"], "tldr": "The article discusses the history and review of the kinin system, focusing on the enzyme systems responsible for hypotensive effects and vascular permeability. The kinin system involves the formation of kinins from plasma proteins through enzyme action. The article covers the discovery of pancreatic kallikrein and plasma kallikrein, as well as the structure of bradykinin and kallidin, two main kinins. The activation of the kinin system is also explored, particularly the role of glass-dependent activation and Hageman factor.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Biochemistry"}
