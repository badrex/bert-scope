These systems are independent and involve only one component of the four-potential. The charged system has an ellipsoidal surface dividing space into a linear and a localized nonlinear region. The neutral doublets in the ground state need explanation in relation to the accepted vector character of the tt mesons and the charge independence of nuclear forces.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Particle Physics"}
