The research discusses the climate, wave action, tides, temperature, insolation, and desiccation affecting the organisms in the intertidal zone. The authors describe the three main zones recognized in the area: the littoral fringe, the eulittoral zone, and the sublittoral zone. The study provides valuable insights into the complex interplay of environmental factors shaping the intertidal ecosystem at Aldabra Atoll.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Marine Biology"}
