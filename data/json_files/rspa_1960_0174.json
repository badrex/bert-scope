They found that the rate-determining step is the chemisorption of nitrogen on a surface mainly covered with NH radicals. This discovery challenges the commonly accepted mechanism of ammonia synthesis and opens new perspectives for further research.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Catalysis"}
