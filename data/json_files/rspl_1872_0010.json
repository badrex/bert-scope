W. Hofmann discovered a new method to transform aniline into toluidine by heating methylaniline salts to high temperatures. This process opens up new possibilities for synthesizing homologues of other monamines and understanding the behavior of aromatic compounds in organic chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
