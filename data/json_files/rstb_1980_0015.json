The researchers found that ts mutants can help determine the number of genes in the virus genome and identify the products of individual genes. They also discovered that ts mutations can lead to a decrease or loss of virus pathogenicity, which could be useful in developing live virus vaccines.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Virology"}
