The proof is based on the Hardy-Littlewood method, which involves dissecting a definite integral into parts and estimating an exponential sum containing a general cubic form. This result extends previous work on additive problems and provides a significant contribution to the understanding of cubic forms and Diophantine equations.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Algebraic Geometry"}
