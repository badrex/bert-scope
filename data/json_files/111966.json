These compounds are formed from the reaction of dinitrobenzol and dinitrotoluol with reducing agents. The author describes their physical properties, solubility, and crystallization behavior, as well as the formation of their salts. The aromatic diamines have a wide range of potential applications and can be used to create various derivatives through chemical reactions.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organic Chemistry"}
