The author compares the night-blind individuals' perception of colors and light with that of normal vision, and suggests that the difference in perception is due to the absence of sensitive rods in the retina of night-blind individuals. The study provides insights into the genetic and physiological aspects of night-blindness and its impact on color vision.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Vision and Perception"}
