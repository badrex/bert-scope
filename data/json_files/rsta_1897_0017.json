They developed a method to measure the heat evolved during the occlusion process and found that the heat evolved per gram of hydrogen occluded for the fraction of hydrogen that can be removed at the ordinary temperature is the same as for the portion that can be extracted in vacuo at 184\u00b0C. This research is important in understanding the behavior of gases towards platinum black and its applications in electrical experiments.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Physical Chemistry"}
