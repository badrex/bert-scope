The study reveals that the amount of alcohol taken up at saturation varies between 223 and 229 mg/gm, and the inflexion in the desorption curve occurs at about 160 mg/gm. The findings contribute to the understanding of adsorption and surface chemistry.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Surface Chemistry"}
