They find that a \"time effect\" occurs, where some nitric oxide is destroyed between its formation and refrigeration. This destruction is associated with the presence of nitrogen, suggesting that active nitrogen plays a role in the chemical reaction.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Chemical kinetics"}
