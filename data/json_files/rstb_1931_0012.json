They developed a technique to separate and isolate metabolic products, and then estimate their carbon content through combustion. The authors also designed a suitable apparatus for cultivating microorganisms and analyzing their metabolic products, which can be used for various types of microorganisms.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Microbiology"}
