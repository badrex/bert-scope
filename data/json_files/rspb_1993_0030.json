The results show a reduced PCr/(PCr+Pi) ratio in mdx muscles during exercise and recovery, indicating impaired mitochondrial metabolism. However, the similarity in PCr recovery times suggests that the muscle has adapted, making any impairment of oxidative metabolism negligible in the intact system. The rate of pH recovery is prolonged in mdx muscle, providing strong evidence for a decline in the capacity of dystrophic muscle to extrude proton equivalents.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Molecular and Cellular Biology"}
