They observed that the cracks were specifically oriented according to crystallographic expectations of easy cleavage directions. The surface distortions that accompanied the cracks were studied using multiple-beam interference methods, revealing permanent distortions and providing evidence for the existence of plastic flow in diamonds at room temperature.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
