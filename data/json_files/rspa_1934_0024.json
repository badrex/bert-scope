They found that both dyes have similar states of aggregation in their N/70 solutions, and the transport number of the negative radical increases with increasing aggregation. This research helps to understand the constitution of micelles in colloidal electrolytes.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Colloidal Chemistry"}
