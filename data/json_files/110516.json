They explain the unique adaptations in these muscles' structure and actions, which allow for diverse and precise movements. The author also discusses methods for determining muscle strength, proposing the use of Mr. Daniell's new battery for galvanism.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Anatomy and Physiology"}
