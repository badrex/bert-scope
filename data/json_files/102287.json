He argues against the idea that these shells were brought to land through changes in sea and land levels, and instead proposes that they were left there during the Universal Deluge. The author explains how the Earth's current state was formed after this catastrophic event, and discusses the role of God in bringing about this change for the betterment of mankind.", "scientific_discipline": "Earth Sciences > Geology"}
