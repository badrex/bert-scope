They introduce bending terms into Rosen's metric for cylindrical waves, examining the transition from cylindrical to spherical waves and their asymptotic behavior. The study provides further understanding of the axial singularity and the nature of the radiation.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > General Relativity"}
