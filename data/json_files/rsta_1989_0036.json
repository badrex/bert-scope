It highlights the unique features of the Antarctic region, such as the wide separation of the geographic and geomagnetic poles, which lead to hemispheric asymmetries and longitudinal structure in the high-latitude ionosphere and magnetosphere. The article also presents various examples of research conducted in Antarctica and the experimental methods used to overcome logistical difficulties."}
