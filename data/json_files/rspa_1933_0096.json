They argue that previous assumptions, such as the extent of the lubricating film being determined by the brass, are not accurate and can lead to discrepancies between calculation and experiment. The new approach suggests that the film's boundaries should not be determined by the extent of the brass, leading to a more accurate understanding of the behavior of lubricated surfaces.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Fluid mechanics"}
