They analyze the potential and velocity distributions at the head of the wave and discuss the asymptotic behavior of the returning wave at large distances from the wave front. The study provides insights into the energy distribution in the returning wave and its relation to the incident pulse.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Fluid Dynamics"}
