They found that the decay product of uranium is a radioactive element with similar chemical properties to protactinium. The half-life of this element was measured to be approximately 5 years, confirming its identity as protactinium. This study supports the idea that uranium is the parent of protactinium.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Nuclear chemistry"}
