They discovered that the scale consists of three discrete layers: a thin silica layer, a middle layer of rhombohedral oxide, and an outer layer of spinel oxide. The growth of the rhombohedral and spinel oxide layers occurs primarily by outward cation movement, controlled by diffusion through the thin silica layer. This research provides a better understanding of the physical structure and growth mechanism of oxide scales on Nb-stabilized stainless steel.", "scientific_discipline": "Materials Science > Corrosion and Oxidation"}
