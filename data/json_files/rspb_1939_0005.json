The research focuses on determining lung capacity and its subdivisions, including residual air, functional residual air, vital capacity, reserve air, and total lung volume. The findings show that the mean values of lung capacity and its subdivisions are lower than previous studies, likely due to the smaller stature of the subjects. The study emphasizes the importance of considering individual build and stature when analyzing respiratory health metrics.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Human Physiology"}
