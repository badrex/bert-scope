The authors use the averaged-equation approach of Hinch to develop the general theory and calculate specific results for conduction parallel and perpendicular to a sudden jump in concentration. The effect of inhomogeneity is found to decay proportional to the cube of the ratio of the particle radius to the distance from the inhomogeneity.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Thermodynamics"}
