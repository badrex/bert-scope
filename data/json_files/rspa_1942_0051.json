A. Jahn and Sir William Bragg, conducted a detailed calculation of the surfaces of isodiffusion for the (002), (112), (222), and (110) reflexions of sodium single crystals. They used the Faxen-Waller theory to explain the diffuse scattering process and found that their theoretical predictions matched the experimental results closely. This research confirmed the theory of the diffuse scattering process and opened up a new field of research for determining the elastic constants of crystals using X-ray diffraction.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Crystallography"}
