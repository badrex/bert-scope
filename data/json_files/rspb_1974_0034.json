The researchers used electron microscopy and metal shadowing techniques to reveal the surface structure of the intact thick filaments. The findings show a regular arrangement of round objects on the filament, interpreted as groups of myosin heads, forming the Bear-Selby net pattern. This discovery helps to understand the structure and function of the thick filaments in molluscan muscles.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Muscle Structure"}
