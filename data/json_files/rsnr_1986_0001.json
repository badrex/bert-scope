They were first introduced to the Royal Society in the 17th century and have since been studied for their scientific and historical significance. The drops' strength comes from the glass transitioning from a viscous fluid to a hard elastic solid, creating a rigid outer layer that encloses a hot interior. This unique structure makes the drops resistant to hammering but can break into powder with slight pressure on the tail. The drops' history and the research conducted on them provide valuable insights into the early days of experimental science."}
