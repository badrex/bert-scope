Researchers found that the polymorphism involves different combinations of chromosome arms in various karyotypic races. The study aims to understand the maintenance of this polymorphism and its implications on the common shrew's biology.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Genetics and Cytogenetics"}
