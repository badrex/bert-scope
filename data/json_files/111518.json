A. Wanklyn, discovered new ethyl-compounds containing alkalimetals, specifically sodium-ethyl. He found that sodium and zinc-ethyl react, forming crystals containing sodium and zinc. These crystals have unique properties, such as being reduced by heat alone and reacting with other substances like potassium. Wanklyn also proposed a hypothesis about the electrolytic decomposition of organometallic compounds based on the reactions he observed.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Organometallic Chemistry"}
