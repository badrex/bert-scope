This process occurs without the participation of molecular oxygen, suggesting that light-induced reactions can promote reactions that utilize ATP independently of photosynthesis in leaf tissue supplied anaerobically with glucose. This finding supports the hypothesis that cyclic photophosphorylation may, under certain conditions, divert light energy into channels other than CO2 assimilation.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Photosynthesis and Plant Physiology"}
