They proposed a classification of the order Amoebida based on nuclear division and discussed its relation to previously defined families and genera of amoebae, as well as its implications for phylogeny. The study found that metronidazole and other anti-amoebic drugs were ineffective against certain pathogenic amoebae.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Protozoology"}
