They discuss the challenges in choosing an appropriate theoretical analysis and accurately specifying necessary parameters for the analysis. The study indicates that for this specific system, fracture energy is accurately given by a first-order analysis, which provides a means of computing values for similar systems.", "scientific_discipline": "Engineering and Technology > Materials Science"}
