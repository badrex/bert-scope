He found that the Dead Sea water is highly saturated with salt and has a strong acidity. It contains a good amount of a gross fixed vitriol, some alum, and a mural salt of a limy quality. The water is not suitable for internal use but can be beneficial for external use, such as treating skin diseases, scurvy, and leprosy. It may also help restore the natural state of the solids, promote blood circulation, and aid in the natural digestions and secretions.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Geochemistry"}
