They discover a new compound formed between methoemoglobin and sulfur, which is different from previously described compounds like sulpho-haemoglobin. The author also studies the absorption spectra of methoemoglobin, acid methemoglobin, and alkaline methemoglobin, finding differences in their properties.", "scientific_discipline": "Chemistry > Biochemistry"}
