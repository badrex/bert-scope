They develop an effective Hamiltonian that accounts for relativistic effects and can be used in non-relativistic coupling calculations. This approach simplifies the computational process and allows for more accurate predictions of hyperfine structure in atoms.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Atomic and Molecular Physics"}
