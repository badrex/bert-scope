They discovered that the efficiency of slowing down neutrons depends on the amount of hydrogenous material present. The results indicated that fast neutrons are reduced to half-value in 7 cm of water, while slow neutrons diffuse outwards a distance of about 1 cm before being reduced to half. This research provides insights into the processes involved in neutron slowing down and can be applied to improve the efficiency of neutron detection and measurement.", "scientific_discipline": "Physics > Nuclear Physics"}
