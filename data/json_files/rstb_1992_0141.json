The ozone loss occurs rapidly in the polar lower stratosphere due to heterogeneous reactions on polar stratospheric clouds, turning chlorine into reactive forms. This process, combined with the removal of nitrogen oxides and lack of mixing with lower latitudes, maintains the ozone depletion until the dynamical conditions change with the approach of summer. The ozone hole has led to a major rethink of theories of ozone depletion and has become a critical issue in understanding and addressing climate change.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Atmospheric Science"}
