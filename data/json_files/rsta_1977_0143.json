The study covers edge loads and uniform normal surface loads on thin shell-like bodies. The main results are summarized in three theorems and several corollaries, covering developable, spherical, and surfaces of variable Gaussian curvature. These solutions are exhaustive for the class of elastic materials characterized by the strain energy response function used.", "scientific_discipline": "Mathematics > Applied Mathematics", "sub_discipline": "Mechanics > Solid Mechanics"}
