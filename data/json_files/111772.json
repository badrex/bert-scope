The process involves the investment of blastema and the formation of bands bordering the fibre. The author also discusses the differences in fibre size at various stages of development and the fact that the stages do not necessarily occur in a simple consecutive series.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Developmental Biology"}
