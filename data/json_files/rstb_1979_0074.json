Dieldrin satisfies the requirements of being a stomach poison, persistent, cumulative, and safe for users and consumers. The Sayer exhaust sprayer and aircraft spraying methods are explored as efficient ways to distribute the insecticide. The use of dieldrin in locust hopper control has been exaggerated by propaganda, and a value judgement should be made considering the benefits and risks.", "scientific_discipline": "Environmental and Earth Sciences > Ecology and Pest Control"}
