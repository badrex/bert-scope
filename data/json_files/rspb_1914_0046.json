They found that carbon dioxide inhibits germination and enforces dormancy in seeds, and that this effect is influenced by temperature and oxygen supply. Higher temperatures require higher carbon dioxide pressures to maintain dormancy, while lower temperatures require lower pressures. Additionally, an increased oxygen supply decreases the inhibitory effect of carbon dioxide on seeds.", "scientific_discipline": "Biology and Life Sciences > Plant Biology"}
